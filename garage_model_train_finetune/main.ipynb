       "  'In the opening verse of “Easy On Me,” Adele recalls how her relationship with Simon Konecki had reached a breaking point. After six years of dating, Adele indirectly announced her marriage to Simon Konecki at the  59th Annual Grammy Awards in 2017.  However, in 2019, her team formally shared the news of their separation to Associated Press.\\n\\nAdele states in the opening lyric that she no longer finds value in the “river” which is a metaphor for her relationship. Based on her interview with Vogue USA where she shared that the album is about “divorcing myself,” the “river” can also be a reference to her life. Despite constantly trying to make her married life work and remain happy in doing so, she no longer found value in her life in that state.\\n\\nIn her interview with Vogue UK she talked about these sentiments referring to her divorce,\\n\\nPeople were everywhere, trying to get stories, and I just hated it. I was embarrassed. I was really embarrassed. That thing of not being able to make something work. We’ve been trained as women to keep trying, even by the movies we watched when we were little. At the time it broke my heart, but I actually find it so interesting now. How we’re told to suck it up.”\\n\\nDespite all her struggles, Adele also shares that she didn’t want to give up hope. She tried to save her relationship but in the end, the couple drowned themselves in silence.'),\n",

She recognizes, however, that those “good intentions” and “highest hopes” will probably go unnoticed by her son. She shared her experience with handling her son’s confusion in her interview with Vogue UK, confessing that she didn’t have all the answers either,\\n\\nAngelo’s just like, ‘I don’t get it.’ I don’t really get it either. There are rules that are made up in society of what happens and doesn’t happen in marriage and after marriage, but I’m a very complex person.

In an interview for Vogue magazine, Adele speaks on how 30 partly serves as an explanation for the divorce to her child:\\n\\nIf I can reach the reason why I left, which was the pursuit of my own happiness, even though it made Angelo really unhappy—if I can find that happiness and he sees me in that happiness, then maybe I’ll be able to forgive myself for it. […] He said to my face, ‘Can you see me?’ And I was like, ‘Uh, yeah.’ And he was like, ‘'Cause I can’t see you.’ Well, my whole life fell apart in that moment. He knew I wasn’t there. That’s when I started sharing with him. […] He has so many simple questions for me that I can’t answer, because I don’t know the answer. Like, ‘Why can’t we still live together?’ ‘That’s just not what people do when they get divorced.’ ‘But why not?’ I’m like, ‘I don’t fucking know. That’s not what society does.’ And: ‘Why don’t you love my dad anymore?’ And I’d be like, ‘I do love your dad. I’m just not in love.’ I can’t make that make sense to a nine-year-old.\\n\\nAlternatively, she may be speaking directly to her ex-husband, asking him for understanding and tenderness. Perhaps, in a sense, she is also talking to herself, reminding herself not to feel guilty or blameworthy.\\n\\nAdam Neely did an awesome breakdown about how Adele uses “pitch as an expressive device” on this chorus:\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njyCxQxR41M&t=15s\"),\n",

However, she realizes that she’s had enough and she must put herself first.
