Now you say you're lonely
You cry the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river

Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river

Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

I want to lay your head upon your savior's breast

I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
One of these mornings bright and early and soon, goodnight
Now they're pickin' up the spirit to the shore beyond, goodnight

Go walking in the valley of the shadow of death, goodnight
He's riding a staff, gonna comfort me, goodnight
Join the wise, there's a soul to find, goodnight
Lord send a fire, not a flood next time, goodnight
To leave for the ark, that wonderful boat, goodnight
She really loaded down, getting water to float, goodnight
Now pray for the beast at the ending of the world, goodnight
He loved the children that would not be good, goodnight
I remember rather well, I remember right well, goodnight
I went walking to jerusalem just like john
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it right
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending
Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
One for life and one for love
And all you've given me
For the dreams you made me dream again
And all that we can be

But we've got to learn to accept each other, for who we are today

To hold onto each other, until the day we die

Where she'd bring the paper to me
Sit down on my knee and whisper
Oh, I love you
But now she's gone forever
And this old house it will never
Be the same without the love
That we once knew

Straight ahead that's the bed
Where we'd lie in love together
And Lord knows we had
A good thing going here

See her picture on the table
Don't it look like she'd be able
Just to touch me and say
Good mornin' dear

There's her rings all her things
And her clothes are in the closet
Where she left them when
She tore my world apart

As you leave you'll see the nursery
Oh, she left me without mercy
Takin' nothin' but our baby
And my heart

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And peace to men on earth

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today

The great glad tidings tell

Well the national anthem has come and gone
I still got the tv on
And white noise

Well, I've fought some sleep, in a straight back chair

Caught in the flood
Reaching for some high ground

I look up
The setting sun is bathing the world with a healing light
Little darlin', it's gonna be a beautiful night
The rolling of distant thunder
Trouble ahead
Now don't you be afraid now
We'll get through it somehow

Just look up

Some like burning all night long
Some like howling at the moon
Some just like to sing along
Cause we get lonely, lonely, we get so lonely

Can make me forget everything but you babe, everything but you

Where people are of one heart
Yes we gather in the chapel

Honey, you're the most
Baby, you set my soul on fire
Ever since I met you
Honey, I had to get you
You have been my one desire

How could I help but love you
With a love so true
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part
It wouldn't be your fault
Yeah, it would be all mine
If you would ever leave me
Honey, it sure would grieve me
Baby, it would break my heart
But I won't let that worry me
This love will always be
It was meant right from the start

How could I help but love you
With a love so true
You send cold chills down my spine
If we would ever part
It wouldn't be your fault
Yeah, it would be all mine

When you hold me close
Honey, you're the most

All them's fear is fear itself
Check our your own backyard 'fore you check out someone else
Railroad track in my neighbourhood
Ain't no trains around that part, just ain't no good
Wanna know, what’s going down
When the pimp on the corner looks like the sharpest cat in town?

[Verse 2]
Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook of a crook, cold time for cool
Look out jay, what you say, what you carryin' brother?
I hope you're clean 'cause the man is mean
But don't come another further
[Bridge 1]
We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load, right along with mine

[Chorus]
Thank you ma'am, mister please
'Cause I must be Hercules
I must be Hercules

[Verse 3]
Like a bird, on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing
I can feel the pressure from every side
If you're not gonna help, don't hurt
Just pass me by

[Bridge 2]
Oh no
No, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no

[Chorus]
Hercules
I must be Hercules

[Verse 4]
Jungle rule, can't be no fool
The devil is on the loose, no coo
Got your feet in the sand
Got to be down with the cats that're around
And still got the face the man
You might also like[Chorus]
Talk about me if you please but I must be Hercules
Hercules
I must be Hercules

[Verse 5]
Duckin' rocks, catchin' stone
Mutin', how can I survive
What’s going on
Beg, steal, or borrow
Somehow I've got to make it till tomorrow

[Bridge]
Can't depend on no one else
Comin' up the hard way, I've got to save myself

[Chorus]
Must be Hercules
I must be Hercules
Talk about me if you please

Well, you can cry me a river

Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river

Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do

When I enter the room, I smell your perfume
The taste of your lips is like the nectar from the gods

Then you take me to heaven and back down to the ground

You're everything a man could want
Everything a man could need
And at night I fall down, on my knees
And thank God for sending an angel, just to love me

In the silence I listened to voices inside me
And they told me again and again

The is only one river. There is only one sea

There is only one people. We are one and the same

Every drop in the sea
Every cry of a newborn baby
Every prayer to be free
Every hope at the end of a rainbow
Every song ever sung
Is a part of the family of woman and man

You're sitting around mopin', cryin', cryin'
You say you even think about dying
Well, before you do anything rash, baby, listen to this

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

Fallin' in love is such an easy thing to do
But there's no guarantee that the one you love, is gonna love you
Oh, loving eyes they cannot see a certain person could never be
Love runs deeper than any ocean, it clouds your mind with emotion
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby
It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

How can you help it, when the music starts to play
And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you

Hey, everybody plays the fool, sometime
Use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again
Everybody plays the fool

Everybody plays the fool, sometime
There's no exception to the rule, listen baby

All them's fear is fear itself
Check our your own backyard 'fore you check out someone else
Railroad track in my neighbourhood
Ain't no trains around that part, just ain't no good
Wanna know, what’s going down
When the pimp on the corner looks like the sharpest cat in town?

[Verse 2]
Jungle rule, can't be no fool
Might get caught by the hook of a crook, cold time for cool
Look out jay, what you say, what you carryin' brother?
I hope you're clean 'cause the man is mean
But don't come another further
[Bridge 1]
We all know the answer will come out in time
I might even carry some of your load, right along with mine

[Chorus]
Thank you ma'am, mister please
'Cause I must be Hercules
I must be Hercules

[Verse 3]
Like a bird, on the wing
I just wanna be free enough to do my thing
I can feel the pressure from every side
If you're not gonna help, don't hurt
Just pass me by

Oh no
No, no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no

Gotta wake up soon
Too many, too many mornings
Whoa Lord gotta wake up soon
Oh and eat my breakfast by the light of the moon

It was late, very late last summer
When I first got my time
Whoa it was late, very very late last summer
You know when I, I first got my time
My buddy got one hundred years
Thank the Lord I just got ninety-nine
If you see, if you see my mama
Won't you tell her this for me
Lord, if you see, if you see my dear old mother
Won't you please tell her this for me
I got a long long time
And Lord knows when I'm gonna be free

You know they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
Lord, they come up here a skippin' and a jumpin'
But you know that they won't last long
One day they're gonna wish they were a baby boy
In their mothers arms

You know they're always, always talking
About dangerous blue
Whoa, you know they're always talking
About dangerous blue
If I had my big old pistol
You know I'd be dangerous too

Twelve jury men found me guilty
The doorman looked me up and down
Lord, twelve jury men found me guilty
You know the doorman looked me up and down
Just looked at me through the corner of his eye and said
Boy, you're penitentiary bound

Oh, how I’d like to hold her
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was in heaven
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her

Gypsy woman, she was a gypsy woman
Gypsy woman, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was in heaven
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her

Various Artists,I Fall To Pieces,0.45,0.301,10,-11.206,1,0.0273,0.754,0.000529,0.0921,0.245,89.555,227227,4,"Is Music Just For Money Nowadays? LyricsMany of my friends here on Genius know that I'm a huge fan of Taylor Swift, and have been for many years. As many of you have likely heard, Taylor recently released a movie of her 1989 World Tour exclusively on Apple Music. While other Swifties were celebrating, I was confused. Just months before, Taylor refused to put her music on the streaming service to protest the fact that they didn't pay artist royalties during listeners' free trials. Why would she decide to stream her tour with them? Was it her decision at all?

Taylor's management has been more controlling than ever since the release of her fifth album, 1989. They have been ruthless about copyright, even forcing fans to take tour videos down from YouTube. In addition, prices for her merchandise have skyrocketed. Tour t-shirts on her website cost $34.89, while they cost $25 on her *Speak Now* Tour. Some fans even believe Taylor's management runs her ""personal"" Tumblr blog.

With all of these instances in mind, I began to wonder what the music industry has truly become. Taylor, along with other artists, started making music to follow a lifelong dream, and now her empire can be viewed as simply a source of income for her team. But ask any of her true fans, and they'll say she's still the same girl. Taylor is known to give back to her fans. On her previous tours, she would wear bracelets just so she could throw them to fans in the audience. She would point out fans who went to great lengths for their outfits and even brought, and still brings, some of them backstage to meet her. So, if Taylor is still the same girl, why is her career becoming a money pit for others rather than an outlet for her own passion?

This has happened to various artists over the years, including now-indie-artist Cody Simpson. Cody was discovered at a young age through MySpace. He couldn't believe he was finally making his dream come true. Flash forward a few years, and Cody's record label and management were forcing him to put out music he didn't want to make. He eventually had enough, and went on to leave his label and create music he poured his heart into. But not all artists can simply walk away as easily as Cody did.

This leads me back to my original question -- is music even about heart anymore? While some artists' influence is used to rake in big bucks, there are still some artists who make music to make music. These people are the backbone of the music industry, although they often fall victim to one of two fates: being overlooked, or being used for money. Some people even make music solely for this purpose. Many people criticize music, wondering, ""what happened to music with a meaning?"" The answer? It's still out there, if you know where to look.

DISCLAIMER: I am in no way trying to insult or call out anyone in particular with these observations; I am simply pointing out that the music industry has changed. This may sound like I am intentionally bashing Taylor's management, but that is not my goal with this piece. This has happened to other artists as well, not just Taylor. I have no doubt in my mind that Taylor is the same lovely girl she was when she put out her first album, and hope she stays true to her heart. I wrote this piece to expose how the music scene has changed from a way to express yourself to a way to make money. I hope that the industry is fully restored soon.2Embed",2395139.0,"[('Taylor refused to put her music on the streaming service to protest the fact that they didn’t pay artist royalties during listeners’ free trials.', [['Taylor had already been refusing streaming services as far back as 2012.\n\nIt’s my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album’s price point is. I hope they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.\n\nNow at the time, Apple Music hadn’t even begun. Her complaint was over the fact that her music could, theoretically, be streamed by anyone in the world for free, provided they put up with Spotify’s ad tier.\n\nHer dispute with Apple Music is more recent and more potent. In June of 2015, it was reported that Apple Music wouldn’t pay royalties to labels (and, as a consequence, artists) during their 3 month free trial period. Swift was not impressed.\n\nWe don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation\n\nApple reneged quickly, basically overnight:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/cue/status/612824775220555776']]), ('Why is her career becoming a money pit for others rather than an outlet for her own passion?', [[""This is truly the music industry, it has gone from an outlet for soul and heart to money money money money money.

But there was absolutely nothing by Taylor on there except for “Bad Blood”. I haven’t seen any artist that strict before, Mac Miller tried to take his stuff down from Youtube, but stuff still leaked onto there to the point that it’s like he never tried. Taylor has a tight fucking leash on everything, I’ll give her that. But when I can’t “enjoy” her music (It’s pretty terrible) without buying her album, that closes the door.']]), ('While some artists’ influence is used to rake in big bucks, there are still some artists who make music to make music. These people are the backbone of the music industry, although they often fall victim to one of two fates: being overlooked, or being used for money', [['In defense of Taylor removing her music from Spotify, it is not fully black-white as this article suggests: they do it for the profit and for passion in most cases.\n\nWhen a new movie releases, it costs quite a bit of money to view it in the theater– imagine how much box office would collapse if one were able to stream it for free. It would normally take even years for it to be available for free, and a few months until CD. A song on Spotify is worth $.0001 cents, even for new releases.\n\nThere is no doubt money is a huge factor– as Lupe Fiasco described Spotify in a Billboard interview:\n\nMusic is going to become like a utility like water…On a day-to-day basis, we don’t even drink water, like I don’t even want my water, I’m going to drink soda or whatever.

My life has been up and down, been close to an end
But I've been through the mill
And I've paid my dues
Walked so many miles in different peoples shoes

But I've been through the fire
And I've walked in the rain
I've felt the joy and endured the pain

Once I was a schemer
But I always was a dreamer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am
I've met a lot of lost souls in the bowels of hell
Traveled some crooked roads, got some stories yet to tell
I've shot up with the junkie, in piss stench halls
Broken bread with the devil, fallen on my knees to god
Some days I was blessed, some nights I was damned
But I always tried to lend a helping hand

Once I was a deceiver
Not I am a believer
But it took me who I was and where I've been
To make me who I am

Oh, I've seen the little children, all strung out on dope
No one to care about them, living without hope
But I've been lucky that I always had a song
I'll sing it with compassion, to try to right the wrong

Once my life was wretched
But why should I regret it
'cause, it took me who I was, and where I've been
To make me who I am

[Speech]
This is dedicated to my friends in jail
For my brother jake who had to ride the rail
For my friend roonie and melvin, who were so dear
They were so misunderstood
But I wish they were still here
To hear this song I sing from my heart
They're forever in my soul, even though we had to part

I'm going away
Any day now
I'm going to Heaven to stay

Maybe morning, night or noon
But I'm going to see the Father
And by His side to stand

There'll be no sorrow, no sadness
Just only complete gladness
But any day now, I know that I
Know that I am going home
Then I'll shout Hallelujah

Around the camp fire light
A lovely woman in motion
But hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a candle doll
But it returns me with love

She was a gypsy woman
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round
To a guitar melody
And from far her face was all a glow
How seen a chat in me
Oh, how I’d like to hold her
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear
I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all men
Waiting for the rising sun
Everyone was in heaven
I hate to see the lady go
Knowing she will never know
That I love her, I love her

It is the night of the dear savior's birth!

Till he appear'd and the soul felt it's worth

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh night divine
Led by the light of faith serenely beaming
With glowing hearts by his cradle we stand
So led by light of a star sweetly gleaming
Here come the wise men from orient land
The king of kings lay thus in lowly manger
In all our trials born to be our friend

Truly he taught us to love one another

Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother
And in his name all oppression shall cease

Excuse my aroma, I smell like a diploma
This rap shit done turned a college boy to a grown up
Cause Reign make it thunder in your city, Oklahoma (""Oklahoma City Thunder"")
And I'm sicker than a nigga with lymphoma in a coma
Some rappers talking tough, slow down on your coronas
Nigga I don't give a fuck, I barely even have a boner
It goes to show ya that my town is on lock
Now these girls is starting rumors putting rulers to my ____, she say it's!
Now baby, I'm just playing....or really maybe not, though
Couple of y'all know, but I won't put you on the spot though
Back home they wanting kisses but I never spin the bottle
Rather be an asshole than a rapper catching mono
Now everybody I know, say I'm hotter than pablono
Bitch I'm colder than Toronto on a flight to Colorado
A little lonely but I'm never desperado
I just check my playbook and call a quarterback swallow

On Facebook she deleted Alex James
But hey toots, you forgot to unlike Reign...

Haha...how fuckin' ironic
But it's really my fault, I mean, damnit, I bought it
That's why I need a smart girl that'll work hard
Some of these bitches could get fired from a blow job
Don't show me titties, I'd rather see your report card
And what's the capital of ""we don't want no slow broads""
And for the rappers praying that I'm losing
Y'all bitches can kiss my crack, and I ain't talkin' Whitney Houston

Bring 'em to a battle, bet I maim these niggas
They just want me on a track, cause I trained these niggas

You know, like train tracks?
And these muhfuckas is in a panic cause Reign's back
Taking shots, just to get some recognition
I could school these suckas, come back and pay they tuition, but
Retaliation would only be doing favors
So I'll son these haters later, DreamTeam Darth Vader

But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues…

Everyone is playing the same tune.

Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right.

As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability.

I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to £50,000 has been taken up.
I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system.

I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy.

But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.

It is our political duty...…

...and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty...…

...to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.

So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point.

We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice

It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it.

We started to do that in Birmingham this week.

We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one.

We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in.

And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible.
The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand.

I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success.

The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals.

Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all.

So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.

In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history.

Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back.

And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back…

That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets.

That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent.

I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job.

Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller.

He'd just turned eighteen years old.
He was the youngest soldier there.

He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world.

I told him that what he was doing was exceptional.

He told me he was just doing his job.

Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right.

But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong.

In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all.

American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home.

We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need...…

...we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service.

That is all wrong and we are going to put it right.

We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens...

...we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.

And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind.

They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma…the jungles of Malaya…and the freezing cold of the Falklands.

Yesterday the courts ruled that gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to.
They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them.

I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work…

Do not appeal this ruling...

...let's give those brave gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.

These are times of great anxiety.

The financial crisis.

The economic downturn.

The cost of living.

Big social problems.

I know how worried people are.

They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it.

In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans.

Of course your plans are important...…

...but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government.

So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch.

And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.

My values are Conservative values.

Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom.

Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control.

That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today?

But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others.

That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.

For me, the most important word is responsibility.

Personal responsibility.

Professional responsibility.

Civic responsibility.

Corporate responsibility.

Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country.

Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way.

To help others.

That is what this Party is all about.

Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions.

Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility?

Does this make us a more or less responsible society?

Social responsibility, not state control.

Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.

But when it comes to handling a crisis...

...when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues...…

...it's not just about your values.

There's something else people want to know.

When people ask: ""will you make a difference?"" they're often asking will you - i.e. me - will you make a difference?

You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend you can.

The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.

I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is.

For me.

For my country.

I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future.

I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.

I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference.

I am not an ideologue.

I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right.

I hold to some simple principles.

That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government.

But I am also a child of my time.

I want a clean environment as well as a safe one.

I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money.

I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor.

I believe in building a strong team - and really trusting them.

Their success is to be celebrated - not seen as some kind of threat.

Thinking before deciding is good.

Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad.

Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues.

Go with your conviction, not calculation.

The popular thing may look good for a while.

The right thing will be right all the time.

Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying ""we live in a 24 hour media world.""

But this is a country not a television station.

A good government thinks for the long term.

If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess.

We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country.

I know that.

I'm ready for that.

And there is a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes...…

...but about the other issues facing the country too.

It's an argument about experience.

To do difficult things for the long-term...…

...or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term...…

...what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right.

I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages.

Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.

In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister.

He had plenty of experience.

But thank god we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.

Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever.

We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister - for ever.

Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience.

The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience.

We've experienced the massive increase in debt.

We have experienced the huge rise in taxes.

We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended.

This is the argument we will make when the election comes.

The risk is not in making a change.

The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.

There is a simple truth for times like this.

When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going.

You change direction - and that is what we need to do.

So let's look at how we got here - and how we're going to get out.

At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact.

The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.

The debts we built up were too high. Far too high.

The authorities - on both sides of the Atlantic - thought it could go on for ever.

They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever.

They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter.

But it's not just the authorities who were at fault.

Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible.

They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well...…

...and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out.

There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day.

Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.

In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes.

His first big mistake - and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis...…

...was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.

Let me explain.

At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates...…

...he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets...

...and he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy.

He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch.

Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision.

He feared it would end in tears - and it has.

Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing.

After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic.

His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money.

So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help.

The cupboard is bare.

So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis?

How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term?

Now I've studied economics at a great university.

I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs.

And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis.

But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.

First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes.

Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down.

So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy.

That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs.

But we need fiscal responsibility too.

So we will rein in government borrowing.

You know what that means.

The country needs to know what that means.

And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor.

Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad.

It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture...…

...it means clamping down on government waste...…

...and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.

So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances.

But even that will not be enough.

The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise.

To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility.

There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures - for all governments, forever.

It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes.

Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed.

You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong.

We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run...…

...and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.

It's a change that will help us get taxes down.

I believe in low taxes - and today, working people are crying out for relief.

Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.

But I am a fiscal conservative.

So is George Osborne.

We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing.

So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down.

To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare.

To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.

I know it's your money.

I know you want some of it back.

And I want to give it to you.

It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job.

But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so...…

...once we've made government live within its means.

The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets.

It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say ""no"" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest.

That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.

Sound money; low taxes.

Simple beliefs with profound implications.

And here's something else I believe about the economy.

I believe that people create jobs, not governments.

I understand enterprise.

I admire entrepreneurs.

I should do - I go to bed with one every night.

And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.

Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland.

A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month.

You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday.

He's from Worcestershire - and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years.

He saw it grow into something he described as ""magical"", employing five people and contributing to the economy.

And then along came Labour.

Now he's down to his last employee and he says ""I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.""

What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others.

So here's what we're going to do.

We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes.

We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.

But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance.

I have never believed in just laissez-faire.

I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry.

So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north...…

...the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network...…

...linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds...…

...let's help rebalance Britain's economy.

But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn.

In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things...…

...how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS...…

...and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.

Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that.

You may have heard it.

I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline.

It goes like this.

In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state.

Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too.

A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week.

It revealed a huge amount about them.

David Miliband said that ""unless government is on your side you end up on your own.""

""On your own"" - without the government.

I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.

For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between.

No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on.

No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in.

No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance.

You cannot run our country like this.

It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour.

They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.

This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life.

If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form.

Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer.

Even foreign exchanges for students…you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.

No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government.

But even more than that we need a stronger society.

That means trusting people.

And sharing responsibility.

But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order.

That means sorting out our broken politics.

People are sick of it.

Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism.

Copper-bottomed pensions.

Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer.

Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.

This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem.

It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out.

In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians.

And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.

That's what I have done.

The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list - they have all got to go.

And it's no different in Europe.

We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs.

With European elections next year, the message to them is simple:

If you don't sign, you won't stand.

And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics.

And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite.

Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered.

Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics.

And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.

Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS.

Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&E departments are closing.

Productivity is down.

The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised.

I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are.

But they have been terribly, terribly let down.

Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS...…

...working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs...…

...never mind the rocketing costs of social care...…

...we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering.

Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year.

Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months.

Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.

In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods.

His wife was taken to hospital.

She caught MRSA and she died.

Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter.

He says the treatment his wife received ""was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century £90 billion health service.""

And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her ""sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.""

I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.

This was his reply.

""A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns…

""Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint…

""There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service…

""If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response…

""Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied.""

A Healthcare Commission.

A Health Service Ombudsman.

A Patient Advice and Liaison Service.

An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service.

Four ways to make a complaint...…

...but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity.

We need to change all that.

But here is the plain truth.

We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in.

Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS.

We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care...…

...so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients.

This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service...…

...not a take it or leave it bureaucracy.

I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed.

We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.

But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government.

If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before.

It is our plan for social reform.

The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform.

That's how we plan to repair our broken society.

I know this is a controversial argument.

Some say our society isn't broken.

I wonder what world they live in.

Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works.

Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip.

Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets.

Children killing children.

Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year.

A gun crime every hour.

A serious knife crime every half hour.

A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.

But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour.

It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us.

When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history...…

...that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm...…

...not just for their own children but for other people's too.

Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday.

I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year.

This woman, whose husband Gary was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep…

This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.

Helen Newlove knows our society is broken.

But she believes we can repair it - and so do I.

The big question is how.

And here is where we need some very plain speaking.

There are those who say - and there are many in this hall - that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places.

And to a degree, they're right.

We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.

But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.

Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates.

Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar.

But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could.

The teenager hooked on heroin.

The young man who never knew the love of a father.

The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more.

Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background...…

...and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.

There are those who say that all of this - mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money.

And to a degree, they are right too.

We are not an anti-state party.

In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger.

Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards.

But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing.

That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem.

I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes.

That will be the test of our character and judgment.

First, families.

If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support.

So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family.

I know families can be imperfect.

I get the modern world.

But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety...…

...the family is the best welfare system there is.

That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers...…

...so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born.

To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.

Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions.

Health visitors are a lifeline - and I want more of them.

It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working.

To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say ""wrong"".

Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes - and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country?

Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women...…

...half the talent of the country...…

...are just put off from joining the workforce.

We will also back marriage in the tax system.

To those who say…why pick out marriage... …

...why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married...…

...I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times...…

...and that's something we should cherish as a society.

When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance.

My passion about this is both political and personal.

After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it.

I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are.

He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party.

But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children - and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.

There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school.

But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities.

Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure.

That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have.

And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up.

And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.

The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy...…

...and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.

Listen to this.

It's the President of the Spelling Society.

He said, and I quote, ""people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.""

He's the President of the Spelling Society.

Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'

And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.

These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system.

You pay their wages.

And do you know what you get in return?

They let a child get marks for writing ""F off"" as an answer in an exam.

As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'.

You're fired.

If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second - then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle.

This problem goes very deep - and dealing with it will be very tough.

There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits.

That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy.

Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective.

But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.

That culture doesn't exist any more.

In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages.

It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure.

Today, it is actively making the problem worse.

So we will end the something for nothing culture.

If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits.

Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits.

Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.

I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus.

In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad.

They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live.

The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own.

What on earth are we doing with a system like that?

With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office:

Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.

In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice.

The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way...…

...but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.

Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve...…

...but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it.

This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century...…

...as we have shown in the centuries that went before...…

...with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli...…

...when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure...…

...when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons...…

...it is this Party, the Conservative Party...…

...it is our means, Conservative means...…

...that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.

Progressive ends; Conservative means.

That is a big argument about the future.

That is a big change.

And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it.

We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century.

You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good...…

...you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need.

You didn't champion green politics as greenwash...…

...but because climate change is devastating our environment...…

...because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security...

...and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.

You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable...

...but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous...

...and because this Party

...that has always believed in one nation...

...must in this century be a Party of one world.

This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour.

Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.

We are a changed party and we are a united party.

We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west.

The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years.

The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years.

And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose.

And we know that our task is to take people with us.

Rebuilding our battered economy.

Renewing our bureaucratised NHS.

Repairing our broken society.

That is our plan for change.

But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations.

I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.

These difficult times need leadership, yes.

They need character and judgment.

The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team.

The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough.

The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change.

Leadership, character, judgment.

That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.

I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature...

in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties...

...whether those problems are created by man or nature.

We can and will come through.

We always do.

Not because of our government.

But because of the people of Britain.

Because of what you do - because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create...

...because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination.

So because we are united...…

Because we have had the courage to change...…

Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.

I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together.

Together in the face of this financial crisis.

Together in determination that we will come through it.

Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.Embed",116146.0,"[('I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.', [['Oops.']])]"

Yeah, she drives me crazy, but it suits me fine

That loved to sing and play
He brought his music from the cotton fields
To the the hillbilly hall of fame
Thank God for Jimmie Rodgers
Chisel his name in the cornerstone

When country took the throne
Now a million songs have come and gone
Since we made that humble start
About neon nights, everyday life
Love and broken hearts
And more and more folks
Kept tuning in and turning on
Now I can proudly say that I saw the day
When country took the throne
Now from Carolina to California, Texas to New York
They can't get enough of this country stuff
And they're screaming for more
We painted the town with that grand old sound
And the whole world sang along
Yes, I was there the day

When country took the throne

Now, no one knows what the future holds
But I bet my best guitar
There'll be a jukebox jumping on Jupiter
And a honky-tonk on Mars
In the last frontier they'll stand and cheer
The best music ever known
They'll celebrate that age old day
When country took the throne

Now from Carolina to California, Texas to New York

American Patriotic Band,You've Got to Stand for Something,0.582,0.735,4,-7.296,1,0.034,0.159,0.0,0.129,0.488,83.819,182152,4,"Leader’s speech, Birmingham 2008 LyricsIt's great to be here in the Symphony Hall.

But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues…

Everyone is playing the same tune.

Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right.

As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability.

I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to £50,000 has been taken up.
I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system.

I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy.

But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.

It is our political duty...…

...and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty...…

...to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.

So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point.

We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice

It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it.

We started to do that in Birmingham this week.

We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one.

We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in.

And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible.
The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand.

I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success.

The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals.

Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all.

So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.

In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history.

Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back.

And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back…

That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets.

That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent.

I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job.

Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller.

He'd just turned eighteen years old.
He was the youngest soldier there.

He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world.

I told him that what he was doing was exceptional.

He told me he was just doing his job.

Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right.

But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong.

In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all.

American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home.

We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need...…

...we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service.

That is all wrong and we are going to put it right.

We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens...

...we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.

And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind.

They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma…the jungles of Malaya…and the freezing cold of the Falklands.

Yesterday the courts ruled that gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to.
They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them.

I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work…

Do not appeal this ruling...

...let's give those brave gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.

These are times of great anxiety.

The financial crisis.

The economic downturn.

The cost of living.

Big social problems.

I know how worried people are.

They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it.

In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans.

Of course your plans are important...…

...but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government.

So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch.

And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.

My values are Conservative values.

Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom.

Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control.

That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today?

But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others.

That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.

For me, the most important word is responsibility.

Personal responsibility.

Professional responsibility.

Civic responsibility.

Corporate responsibility.

Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country.

Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way.

To help others.

That is what this Party is all about.

Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions.

Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility?

Does this make us a more or less responsible society?

Social responsibility, not state control.

Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.

But when it comes to handling a crisis...

...when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues...…

...it's not just about your values.

There's something else people want to know.

When people ask: ""will you make a difference?"" they're often asking will you - i.e. me - will you make a difference?

You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend you can.

The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.

I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is.

For me.

For my country.

I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future.

I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.

I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference.

I am not an ideologue.

I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right.

I hold to some simple principles.

That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government.

But I am also a child of my time.

I want a clean environment as well as a safe one.

I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money.

I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor.

I believe in building a strong team - and really trusting them.

Their success is to be celebrated - not seen as some kind of threat.

Thinking before deciding is good.

Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad.

Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues.

Go with your conviction, not calculation.

The popular thing may look good for a while.

The right thing will be right all the time.

Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying ""we live in a 24 hour media world.""

But this is a country not a television station.

A good government thinks for the long term.

If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess.

We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country.

I know that.

I'm ready for that.

And there is a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes...…

...but about the other issues facing the country too.

It's an argument about experience.

To do difficult things for the long-term...…

...or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term...…

...what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right.

I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages.

Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.

In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister.

He had plenty of experience.

But thank god we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.

Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever.

We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister - for ever.

Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience.

The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience.

We've experienced the massive increase in debt.

We have experienced the huge rise in taxes.

We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended.

This is the argument we will make when the election comes.

The risk is not in making a change.

The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.

There is a simple truth for times like this.

When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going.

You change direction - and that is what we need to do.

So let's look at how we got here - and how we're going to get out.

At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact.

The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.

The debts we built up were too high. Far too high.

The authorities - on both sides of the Atlantic - thought it could go on for ever.

They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever.

They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter.

But it's not just the authorities who were at fault.

Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible.

They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well...…

...and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out.

There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day.

Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.

In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes.

His first big mistake - and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis...…

...was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.

Let me explain.

At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates...…

...he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets...

...and he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy.

He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch.

Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision.

He feared it would end in tears - and it has.

Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing.

After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic.

His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money.

So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help.

The cupboard is bare.

So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis?

How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term?

Now I've studied economics at a great university.

I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs.

And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis.

But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.

First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes.

Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down.

So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy.

That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs.

But we need fiscal responsibility too.

So we will rein in government borrowing.

You know what that means.

The country needs to know what that means.

And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor.

Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad.

It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture...…

...it means clamping down on government waste...…

...and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.

So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances.

But even that will not be enough.

The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise.

To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility.

There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures - for all governments, forever.

It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes.

Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed.

You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong.

We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run...…

...and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.

It's a change that will help us get taxes down.

I believe in low taxes - and today, working people are crying out for relief.

Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.

But I am a fiscal conservative.

So is George Osborne.

We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing.

So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down.

To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare.

To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.

I know it's your money.

I know you want some of it back.

And I want to give it to you.

It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job.

But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so...…

...once we've made government live within its means.

The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets.

It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say ""no"" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest.

That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.

Sound money; low taxes.

Simple beliefs with profound implications.

And here's something else I believe about the economy.

I believe that people create jobs, not governments.

I understand enterprise.

I admire entrepreneurs.

I should do - I go to bed with one every night.

And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.

Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland.

A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month.

You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday.

He's from Worcestershire - and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years.

He saw it grow into something he described as ""magical"", employing five people and contributing to the economy.

And then along came Labour.

Now he's down to his last employee and he says ""I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.""

What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others.

So here's what we're going to do.

We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes.

We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.

But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance.

I have never believed in just laissez-faire.

I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry.

So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north...…

...the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network...…

...linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds...…

...let's help rebalance Britain's economy.

But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn.

In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things...…

...how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS...…

...and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.

Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that.

You may have heard it.

I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline.

It goes like this.

In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state.

Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too.

A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week.

It revealed a huge amount about them.

David Miliband said that ""unless government is on your side you end up on your own.""

""On your own"" - without the government.

I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.

For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between.

No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on.

No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in.

No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance.

You cannot run our country like this.

It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour.

They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.

This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life.

If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form.

Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer.

Even foreign exchanges for students…you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.

No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government.

But even more than that we need a stronger society.

That means trusting people.

And sharing responsibility.

But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order.

That means sorting out our broken politics.

People are sick of it.

Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism.

Copper-bottomed pensions.

Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer.

Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.

This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem.

It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out.

In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians.

And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.

That's what I have done.

The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list - they have all got to go.

And it's no different in Europe.

We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs.

With European elections next year, the message to them is simple:

If you don't sign, you won't stand.

And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics.

And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite.

Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered.

Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics.

And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.

Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS.

Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&E departments are closing.

Productivity is down.

The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised.

I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are.

But they have been terribly, terribly let down.

Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS...…

...working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs...…

...never mind the rocketing costs of social care...…

...we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering.

Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year.

Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months.

Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.

In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods.

His wife was taken to hospital.

She caught MRSA and she died.

Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter.

He says the treatment his wife received ""was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century £90 billion health service.""

And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her ""sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.""

I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.

This was his reply.

""A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns…

""Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint…

""There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service…

""If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response…

""Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied.""

A Healthcare Commission.

A Health Service Ombudsman.

A Patient Advice and Liaison Service.

An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service.

Four ways to make a complaint...…

...but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity.

We need to change all that.

But here is the plain truth.

We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in.

Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS.

We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care...…

...so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients.

This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service...…

...not a take it or leave it bureaucracy.

I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed.

We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.

But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government.

If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before.

It is our plan for social reform.

The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform.

That's how we plan to repair our broken society.

I know this is a controversial argument.

Some say our society isn't broken.

I wonder what world they live in.

Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works.

Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip.

Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets.

Children killing children.

Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year.

A gun crime every hour.

A serious knife crime every half hour.

A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.

But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour.

It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us.

When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history...…

...that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm...…

...not just for their own children but for other people's too.

Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday.

I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year.

This woman, whose husband Gary was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep…

This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.

Helen Newlove knows our society is broken.

But she believes we can repair it - and so do I.

The big question is how.

And here is where we need some very plain speaking.

There are those who say - and there are many in this hall - that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places.

And to a degree, they're right.

We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.

But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.

Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates.

Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar.

But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could.

The teenager hooked on heroin.

The young man who never knew the love of a father.

The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more.

Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background...…

...and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.

There are those who say that all of this - mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money.

And to a degree, they are right too.

We are not an anti-state party.

In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger.

Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards.

But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing.

That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem.

I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes.

That will be the test of our character and judgment.

First, families.

If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support.

So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family.

I know families can be imperfect.

I get the modern world.

But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety...…

...the family is the best welfare system there is.

That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers...…

...so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born.

To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.

Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions.

Health visitors are a lifeline - and I want more of them.

It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working.

To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say ""wrong"".

Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes - and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country?

Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women...…

...half the talent of the country...…

...are just put off from joining the workforce.

We will also back marriage in the tax system.

To those who say…why pick out marriage... …

...why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married...…

...I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times...…

...and that's something we should cherish as a society.

When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance.

My passion about this is both political and personal.

After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it.

I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are.

He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party.

But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children - and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.

There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school.

But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities.

Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure.

That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have.

And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up.

And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.

The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy...…

...and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.

Listen to this.

It's the President of the Spelling Society.

He said, and I quote, ""people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.""

He's the President of the Spelling Society.

Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'

And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.

These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system.

You pay their wages.

And do you know what you get in return?

They let a child get marks for writing ""F off"" as an answer in an exam.

As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'.

You're fired.

If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second - then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle.

This problem goes very deep - and dealing with it will be very tough.

There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits.

That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy.

Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective.

But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.

That culture doesn't exist any more.

In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages.

It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure.

Today, it is actively making the problem worse.

So we will end the something for nothing culture.

If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits.

Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits.

Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.

I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus.

In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad.

They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live.

The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own.

What on earth are we doing with a system like that?

With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office:

Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.

In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice.

The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way...…

...but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.

Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve...…

...but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it.

This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century...…

...as we have shown in the centuries that went before...…

...with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli...…

...when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure...…

...when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons...…

...it is this Party, the Conservative Party...…

...it is our means, Conservative means...…

...that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.

Progressive ends; Conservative means.

That is a big argument about the future.

That is a big change.

And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it.

We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century.

You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good...…

...you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need.

You didn't champion green politics as greenwash...…

...but because climate change is devastating our environment...…

...because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security...

...and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.

You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable...

...but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous...

...and because this Party

...that has always believed in one nation...

...must in this century be a Party of one world.

This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour.

Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.

We are a changed party and we are a united party.

We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west.

The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years.

The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years.

And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose.

And we know that our task is to take people with us.

Rebuilding our battered economy.

Renewing our bureaucratised NHS.

Repairing our broken society.

That is our plan for change.

But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations.

I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.

These difficult times need leadership, yes.

They need character and judgment.

The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team.

The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough.

The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change.

Leadership, character, judgment.

That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.

I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature...

in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties...

...whether those problems are created by man or nature.

We can and will come through.

We always do.

Not because of our government.

But because of the people of Britain.

Because of what you do - because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create...

...because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination.

So because we are united...…

Because we have had the courage to change...…

Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.

I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together.

Together in the face of this financial crisis.

Together in determination that we will come through it.

Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.Embed",116146.0,"[('I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.', [['Oops.']])]"

I've walked the straight and narrow
And I've worn a rebel's brand
Sometimes I've had to go without
For bein' my own man
I've rallied to the cause
When I knew the cause was right
I've cut against the grain
But I've kept my peace of mind

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me
Well, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad
Until my dyin' day
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
[Verse 2]
I could take a beaten path
Every time trouble starts
I'd rather take a beatin'
Than to ever cross my heart
Stickin' to my guns
Can't be sold or bought
Holdin' to my honor
No matter what the cost

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me
Well, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad
Until my dyin' day
And I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way

Until my dyin' day
And I wouldn't have it any other way

The house was overrun with ivy, its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the aspect of a ruined tower. The lower rooms were entirely given over to the birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the place had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty copyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The descendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their family when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so much of their forefathers' money, and had been in their possession for several generations before the d'Urbervilles came and built here, was indifferently turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d'Urberville as soon as the property fell into hand according to law. ""'Twas good enough for Christians in grandfather's time,"" they said.

The rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now resounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in coops occupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate agriculturists. The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now filled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs; while out of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully shaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion.

The garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and could only be entered through a door.

When Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in altering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas as the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall opened and a servant in white cap and apron entered. She had come from the manor-house.

""Mrs d'Urberville wants the fowls as usual,"" she said; but perceiving that Tess did not quite understand, she explained, ""Mis'ess is a old lady, and blind.""

""Blind!"" said Tess.
Almost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself she took, under her companion's direction, two of the most beautiful of the Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had likewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and imposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of its chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures—feathers floating within view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass.

In a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with her back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a white-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a large cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has decayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly let go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long sightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered charges—one sitting on each arm.

""Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?"" said Mrs d'Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. ""I hope you will be kind to them. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where are they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so lively to-day, is he? He is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose. And Phena too—yes, they are a little frightened—aren't you, dears? But they will soon get used to you.""

While the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in obedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap, and she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks, their combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her touch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a single feather were crippled or draggled. She handled their crops, and knew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much; her face enacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind.

The birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the yard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had been submitted to the old woman—Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas, Dorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then—her perception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the bird upon her knees.

It reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d'Urberville was the bishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the maid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up. At the end of the ceremony Mrs d'Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling and twitching her face into undulations, ""Can you whistle?""

""Whistle, Ma'am?""

""Yes, whistle tunes.""

Tess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the accomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel company. However, she blandly admitted that such was the fact.

""Then you will have to practise it every day. I had a lad who did it very well, but he has left. I want you to whistle to my bullfinches; as I cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach 'em airs that way. Tell her where the cages are, Elizabeth. You must begin to-morrow, or they will go back in their piping. They have been neglected these several days.""

""Mr d'Urberville whistled to 'em this morning, ma'am,"" said Elizabeth.

""He! Pooh!""

The old lady's face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she made no further reply.
Thus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the birds were taken back to their quarters. The girl's surprise at Mrs d'Urberville's manner was not great; for since seeing the size of the house she had expected no more. But she was far from being aware that the old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship. She gathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her son. But in that, too, she was mistaken. Mrs d'Urberville was not the first mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully, and to be bitterly fond.


In spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess inclined to the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the sun shone, now that she was once installed there; and she was curious to test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to ascertain her chance of retaining her post. As soon as she was alone within the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop, and seriously screwed up her mouth for the long-neglected practice. She found her former ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush of wind through the lips, and no clear note at all.

She remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she could have so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till she became aware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked the garden-wall no less then the cottage. Looking that way she beheld a form springing from the coping to the plot. It was Alec d'Urberville, whom she had not set eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of the gardener's cottage where she had lodgings.

""Upon my honour!"" cried he, ""there was never before such a beautiful thing in Nature or Art as you look, 'Cousin' Tess ('Cousin' had a faint ring of mockery). I have been watching you from over the wall—sitting like Im-patience on a monument, and pouting up that pretty red mouth to whistling shape, and whooing and whooing, and privately swearing, and never being able to produce a note. Why, you are quite cross because you can't do it.""

""I may be cross, but I didn't swear.""

""Ah! I understand why you are trying—those bullies! My mother wants you to carry on their musical education. How selfish of her! As if attending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for any girl. I would flatly refuse, if I were you.""

""But she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow morning.""

""Does she? Well then—I'll give you a lesson or two.""

""Oh no, you won't!"" said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.

""Nonsense; I don't want to touch you. See—I'll stand on this side of the wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel quite safe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There 'tis—so.""

He suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of ""Take, O take those lips away."" But the allusion was lost upon Tess.

""Now try,"" said d'Urberville.

She attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity. But he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did put up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing distressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had laughed.
He encouraged her with ""Try again!""

Tess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she tried—ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound. The momentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes enlarged, and she involuntarily smiled in his face.

""That's it! Now I have started you—you'll go on beautifully. There—I said I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as never before fell to mortal man, I'll keep my word. … Tess, do you think my mother a queer old soul?""

""I don't know much of her yet, sir.""

""You'll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her bullfinches. I am rather out of her books just now, but you will be quite in favour if you treat her live-stock well. Good morning. If you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don't go to the bailiff, come to me.""


It was in the economy of this régime that Tess Durbeyfield had undertaken to fill a place. Her first day's experiences were fairly typical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A familiarity with Alec d'Urberville's presence—which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone—removed much of her original shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which could engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she was more pliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her, owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and, through that lady's comparative helplessness, upon him.

She soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs d'Urberville's room was no such onerous business when she had regained the art, for she had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those songsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she practised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning. Unrestrained by the young man's presence she threw up her mouth, put her lips near the bars, and piped away in easeful grace to the attentive listeners.

Mrs d'Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy damask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment, where they flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little white spots on the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at the window where the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual, she thought she heard a rustling behind the bed. The old lady was not present, and turning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains. Thereupon her whistling became so disjointed that the listener, if such there were, must have discovered her suspicion of his presence. She searched the curtains every morning after that, but never found anybody within them. Alec d'Urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify her by an ambush of that kind.Embed",162228.0,"[('The girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of boots were visible below the fringe of the curtains.', [['Alec is prentend as a creepy stalker. the word ambush makes him out to be a predator. the only reason he didn’t stick around is because he figured there’d be a better time to make his move.']]), ('Owing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother,', [['Tess is manipulated by the fact that she feels obliged to Alec due to her dependence on his mother; she cannot claim he is a bad person, or run away when she is here for money.']]), ('A familiarity with Alec d’Urberville’s presence—which that young man carefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly calling her his cousin when they were alone—removed much of her original shyness of him', [['Alec manipulates Tess; many sufferers of abuse are led to rely on the abuser and warm to them, this is what Alec is trying to do.']]), ('If you meet with any difficulties and want help here, don’t go to the bailiff, come to me.”', [['Again, we can see Alec manipulating Tess while she is vulnerable; in a new place where she will need to ask for help from time to time.

Things that I've said, and the wrong that I've done ain't undone easily
But I'm gonna prove my love to you no matter what it takes
'Cause I didn't come this far just to walk away

Oh I could have turned around a thousand times and went back to where I'm from
But I'd go an extra million miles if I could save what's left of us
Oh It was a burning love that drove me here and girl I hope and pray

But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleagues…

Everyone is playing the same tune.

Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right.

As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability.

I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to £50,000 has been taken up.
I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system.

I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy.

But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.

It is our political duty...…

...and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty...…

...to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.

So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point.

We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choice

It is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it.

We started to do that in Birmingham this week.

We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one.

We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in.

And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible.
The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand.

I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success.

The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals.

Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all.

So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.

In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history.

Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back.

And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come back…

That would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets.

That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent.

I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job.

Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller.

He'd just turned eighteen years old.
He was the youngest soldier there.

He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world.

I told him that what he was doing was exceptional.

He told me he was just doing his job.

Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right.

But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong.

In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all.

American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home.

We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need...…

...we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service.

That is all wrong and we are going to put it right.

We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens...

...we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.

And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind.

They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burma…the jungles of Malaya…and the freezing cold of the Falklands.

Yesterday the courts ruled that gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to.
They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them.

I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it work…

Do not appeal this ruling...

...let's give those brave gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.

These are times of great anxiety.

The financial crisis.

The economic downturn.

The cost of living.

Big social problems.

I know how worried people are.

They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it.

In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans.

Of course your plans are important...…

...but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government.

So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch.

And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.

My values are Conservative values.

Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom.

Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control.

That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today?

But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others.

That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.

For me, the most important word is responsibility.

Personal responsibility.

Professional responsibility.

Civic responsibility.

Corporate responsibility.

Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country.

Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way.

To help others.

That is what this Party is all about.

Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions.

Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility?

Does this make us a more or less responsible society?

Social responsibility, not state control.

Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.

But when it comes to handling a crisis...

...when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues...…

...it's not just about your values.

There's something else people want to know.

When people ask: ""will you make a difference?"" they're often asking will you - i.e. me - will you make a difference?

You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend you can.

The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.

I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is.

For me.

For my country.

I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future.

I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.

I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference.

I am not an ideologue.

I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right.

I hold to some simple principles.

That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government.

But I am also a child of my time.

I want a clean environment as well as a safe one.

I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money.

I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor.

I believe in building a strong team - and really trusting them.

Their success is to be celebrated - not seen as some kind of threat.

Thinking before deciding is good.

Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad.

Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues.

Go with your conviction, not calculation.

The popular thing may look good for a while.

The right thing will be right all the time.

Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying ""we live in a 24 hour media world.""

But this is a country not a television station.

A good government thinks for the long term.

If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess.

We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country.

I know that.

I'm ready for that.

And there is a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes...…

...but about the other issues facing the country too.

It's an argument about experience.

To do difficult things for the long-term...…

...or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term...…

...what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right.

I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.

Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages.

Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.

In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister.

He had plenty of experience.

But thank god we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.

Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever.

We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister - for ever.

Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience.

The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience.

We've experienced the massive increase in debt.

We have experienced the huge rise in taxes.

We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended.

This is the argument we will make when the election comes.

The risk is not in making a change.

The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.

There is a simple truth for times like this.

When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going.

You change direction - and that is what we need to do.

So let's look at how we got here - and how we're going to get out.

At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact.

The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.

The debts we built up were too high. Far too high.

The authorities - on both sides of the Atlantic - thought it could go on for ever.

They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever.

They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter.

But it's not just the authorities who were at fault.

Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible.

They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well...…

...and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out.

There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day.

Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.

In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes.

His first big mistake - and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis...…

...was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.

Let me explain.

At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates...…

...he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets...

...and he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy.

He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch.

Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision.

He feared it would end in tears - and it has.

Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing.

After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic.

His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money.

So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help.

The cupboard is bare.

So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis?

How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term?

Now I've studied economics at a great university.

I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs.

And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis.

But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.

First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes.

Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down.

So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy.

That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs.

But we need fiscal responsibility too.

So we will rein in government borrowing.

You know what that means.

The country needs to know what that means.

And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor.

Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad.

It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture...…

...it means clamping down on government waste...…

...and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.

So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances.

But even that will not be enough.

The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise.

To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility.

There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures - for all governments, forever.

It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes.

Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed.

You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong.

We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run...…

...and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.

It's a change that will help us get taxes down.

I believe in low taxes - and today, working people are crying out for relief.

Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.

But I am a fiscal conservative.

So is George Osborne.

We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing.

So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down.

To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare.

To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.

I know it's your money.

I know you want some of it back.

And I want to give it to you.

It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job.

But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so...…

...once we've made government live within its means.

The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets.

It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say ""no"" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest.

That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.

Sound money; low taxes.

Simple beliefs with profound implications.

And here's something else I believe about the economy.

I believe that people create jobs, not governments.

I understand enterprise.

I admire entrepreneurs.

I should do - I go to bed with one every night.

And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.

Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland.

A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month.

You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday.

He's from Worcestershire - and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years.

He saw it grow into something he described as ""magical"", employing five people and contributing to the economy.

And then along came Labour.

Now he's down to his last employee and he says ""I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame.""

What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others.

So here's what we're going to do.

We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes.

We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.

But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance.

I have never believed in just laissez-faire.

I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry.

So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north...…

...the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network...…

...linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds...…

...let's help rebalance Britain's economy.

But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn.

In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things...…

...how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS...…

...and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.

Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that.

You may have heard it.

I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline.

It goes like this.

In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state.

Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too.

A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week.

It revealed a huge amount about them.

David Miliband said that ""unless government is on your side you end up on your own.""

""On your own"" - without the government.

I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.

For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between.

No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on.

No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in.

No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance.

You cannot run our country like this.

It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour.

They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.

This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life.

If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form.

Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer.

Even foreign exchanges for students…you can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.

No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government.

But even more than that we need a stronger society.

That means trusting people.

And sharing responsibility.

But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order.

That means sorting out our broken politics.

People are sick of it.

Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism.

Copper-bottomed pensions.

Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer.

Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.

This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem.

It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out.

In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians.

And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.

That's what I have done.

The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list - they have all got to go.

And it's no different in Europe.

We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs.

With European elections next year, the message to them is simple:

If you don't sign, you won't stand.

And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics.

And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite.

Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered.

Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics.

And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.

Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS.

Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&E departments are closing.

Productivity is down.

The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised.

I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are.

But they have been terribly, terribly let down.

Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS...…

...working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs...…

...never mind the rocketing costs of social care...…

...we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering.

Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year.

Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months.

Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.

In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods.

His wife was taken to hospital.

She caught MRSA and she died.

Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter.

He says the treatment his wife received ""was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century £90 billion health service.""

And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her ""sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'.""

I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.

This was his reply.

""A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns…

""Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint…

""There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service…

""If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response…

""Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied.""

A Healthcare Commission.

A Health Service Ombudsman.

A Patient Advice and Liaison Service.

An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service.

Four ways to make a complaint...…

...but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity.

We need to change all that.

But here is the plain truth.

We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in.

Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS.

We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care...…

...so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients.

This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service...…

...not a take it or leave it bureaucracy.

I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed.

We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.

But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government.

If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before.

It is our plan for social reform.

The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform.

That's how we plan to repair our broken society.

I know this is a controversial argument.

Some say our society isn't broken.

I wonder what world they live in.

Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works.

Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip.

Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets.

Children killing children.

Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year.

A gun crime every hour.

A serious knife crime every half hour.

A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.

But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour.

It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us.

When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history...…

...that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm...…

...not just for their own children but for other people's too.

Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday.

I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year.

This woman, whose husband Gary was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstep…

This woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.

Helen Newlove knows our society is broken.

But she believes we can repair it - and so do I.

The big question is how.

And here is where we need some very plain speaking.

There are those who say - and there are many in this hall - that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places.

And to a degree, they're right.

We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.

But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.

Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates.

Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar.

But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could.

The teenager hooked on heroin.

The young man who never knew the love of a father.

The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more.

Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background...…

...and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.

There are those who say that all of this - mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money.

And to a degree, they are right too.

We are not an anti-state party.

In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger.

Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards.

But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing.

That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem.

I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes.

That will be the test of our character and judgment.

First, families.

If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support.

So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family.

I know families can be imperfect.

I get the modern world.

But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety...…

...the family is the best welfare system there is.

That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers...…

...so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born.

To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.

Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions.

Health visitors are a lifeline - and I want more of them.

It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working.

To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say ""wrong"".

Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes - and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country?

Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women...…

...half the talent of the country...…

...are just put off from joining the workforce.

We will also back marriage in the tax system.

To those who say…why pick out marriage... …

...why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married...…

...I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times...…

...and that's something we should cherish as a society.

When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance.

My passion about this is both political and personal.

After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it.

I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are.

He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party.

But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children - and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.

There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school.

But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities.

Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure.

That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have.

And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up.

And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.

The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy...…

...and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.

Listen to this.

It's the President of the Spelling Society.

He said, and I quote, ""people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer.""

He's the President of the Spelling Society.

Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'

And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.

These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system.

You pay their wages.

And do you know what you get in return?

They let a child get marks for writing ""F off"" as an answer in an exam.

As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'.

You're fired.

If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second - then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle.

This problem goes very deep - and dealing with it will be very tough.

There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits.

That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy.

Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective.

But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.

That culture doesn't exist any more.

In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages.

It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure.

Today, it is actively making the problem worse.

So we will end the something for nothing culture.

If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits.

Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits.

Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.

I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus.

In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad.

They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live.

The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own.

What on earth are we doing with a system like that?

With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office:

Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.

In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice.

The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way...…

...but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.

Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve...…

...but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it.

This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century...…

...as we have shown in the centuries that went before...…

...with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli...…

...when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure...…

...when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons...…

...it is this Party, the Conservative Party...…

...it is our means, Conservative means...…

...that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.

Progressive ends; Conservative means.

That is a big argument about the future.

That is a big change.

And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it.

We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century.

You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good...…

...you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need.

You didn't champion green politics as greenwash...…

...but because climate change is devastating our environment...…

...because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security...

...and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.

You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable...

...but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous...

...and because this Party

...that has always believed in one nation...

...must in this century be a Party of one world.

This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour.

Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.

We are a changed party and we are a united party.

We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west.

The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years.

The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years.

And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.

We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose.

And we know that our task is to take people with us.

Rebuilding our battered economy.

Renewing our bureaucratised NHS.

Repairing our broken society.

That is our plan for change.

But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations.

I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.

These difficult times need leadership, yes.

They need character and judgment.

The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team.

The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough.

The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change.

Leadership, character, judgment.

That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.

I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature...

in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties...

...whether those problems are created by man or nature.

We can and will come through.

We always do.

Not because of our government.

But because of the people of Britain.

Because of what you do - because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create...

...because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination.

So because we are united...…

Because we have had the courage to change...…

Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.

I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together.

Together in the face of this financial crisis.

Together in determination that we will come through it.

Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.Embed",116146.0,"[('I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.', [['Oops.']])]"

Well, the next thing I recall
She had him back against the wall
Chewing him like a bulldog on a bone
She was putting him in his place
And I mean right up in his face
Dragging him down a list of done-me-wrongs

Well, it was just about now
That the crowd gathered 'round
They've come to watch him pay for his every sin
She called him everything under the sun

And you better stay out of her way
She's got a a million lights, a ton of decorations
And they gotta go up today
Naw, there ain't no doubt when they're all pulled out
She's gonna have a job for you
Yeah, Mama's gettin' ready for Christmas
So you better get ready too

I'll search and find that special tree
One that looks just right
Then I'll decorate it perfectly
Even if it takes all night
Then I'll light the fire
Turn the lights down low
And hang up the mistletoe
And make some lasting memories
We'll never forget
Chorus

A December to remember
Always in our hearts
Spending everyday of the holidays
Wrapped up in each others arms
All I want for Christmas
Is forever to be like this
A December to remember forever more

Verse 2

Don't spend a single cent
On a Christmas gift for me
Cause the thing that I want most of all
Can't be found beneath the tree
It's the loving look that's in your eyes
That money could never buy
And I what I give you in return
Will last throughout the years

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous. Misters very selects for is pleasure must to visit heaven and hell show with mortuary candles and they tears silver which occur every night. Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed",141146.0,"[('Oblate orange', [['Oblate spheroid is the shape of a planet, so on one level Stephen means “upon this Earth”.

And use the armrest for you head
Yeah, the springs are sprung and the
Center sags
And the stuffing is sticking out
But it's times like these she ain't happy
With me
I thank God for this old couch
Yeah, right about now she's as P.O.'ed
As I've ever seen her be
And this pillow and blanket and a mighty
Dirty look
Tells me where I'm gonna sleep
I learned a long time ago don't say
Nothing
And soon she'll simmer down
And with a little bit of luck we'll kiss
And make up
Sitting right here on this old couch

CHORUS
Yeah, this old couch is a pretty safe
Place
While she blows off a little steam
Well she's mad as hell but that's
Alright
She ain't getting rid of me
'Cause there ain't no quitting
Just fogiving and forgetting
That's what love's about
And we both know I'll never go no
Further
Than this old couch
You might also likeIt might take five minutes, take five days
It really all depends
On how long it takes for the begging and
The pleading
To finally start soaking in
Yeah, one of these days I'm gonna learn
Not to stick my big foot in my big mouth
Yeah, and maybe then
I won't have to spend so much time along
Yeah, Right -

And weights what broke the wagon

Sometimes you gotta fight if you wanna get along
You better stand up when that flag gets raised

But the greatest thing about him to me
Was the fact that he believed

Chorus:
He believed in the good Lord above
A straight shootin rifle and the power of love
He believed in why the blood was shed
And if he couldn't be free he'd rather be dead
And to never give up on your dreams
But most of all yeah most of all he believed in me
Well he had his own opinion
About the world and its condition
Spare the rod spoil the child

Toss a lunchbox into a pickup truck
A long, hard day, sure ain't much fun
But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves
You're workin' on a working man's Ph.D

With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
You build the things that really make the world go around
If it works, if it runs, if it lasts, for years
You bet your bottom dollar, it was made right here
With pride, honor and dignity
From a man with a working man's Ph.D
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck

When the quittin' whistle blows and the dust settles down
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
You'll face yourself at the end of the day
And be damn proud of whatever you've made
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see

Like a caged up tiger, she's pacing the floor
And she just can't resist when she feels the pull
She's got a restless spirit that she can't control
And when she gets like this, I gotta let her go

She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere
She can turn it loose and howl
I know what's in store, Katie bar the door
When she winks at me and smiles
She's in a foot stompin,' honky-tonkin'
Love making state of mind
So excuse me, why'all, I gotta answer the call of the wild
If there's ever been a lady, well, baby is
Just more of a woman at times like this
Now, don't you worry about baby stepping out of line
Yeah, she drives me crazy, but it suits me fine
She's hard to handle, so I hold on tight
And Lord knows I got my hands full tonight

She hears the call of the wild every once in a while
She lets down her hair, she's gotta get somewhere

At night on a crowded street
I may never reach across your body
And kill the light when you're asleep

Maybe I'll never watch you dressing
Or sound too familiar on the phone
But I can touch your hand that's against me
And take that moment home

That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
I can dream, I can hope, I can scheme but still I know
That's as close as I'll get to loving you
I won't be there when you need holding
But I'm sure that he can pull you through
But I can sing this song to everybody
And pretend it's not about you

That's as close as I'll get to loving you
Even though there's nothing else I'd rather do
I can dream, I can hope, I can scheme but still I know
That's as close as I'll get to loving you

It ain't that much diff'rent from any other house on the block
And it may not look like we got all our share of the promise
But at least one thing's for sure, I got it honest

Roll out of the sack every mornin', head on down to the mill
Give 'em all I got for eight, 'cause that's the deal
If you'll check out my paycheck
Well, you'll see that there ain't that much on it
But ev'ry single penny I'm paid, I got it honest
I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause buddy if I didn't earn it, I don't want it
That way I can always say, I got it honest

Now you ain't looking at some dude
That was born with a Silver spoon in his mouth
And I might seem like some kind of low-life
To that high-falutin' crowd
But I'm plain spoken, straight talkin'
And damn proud of what I have acomplished
Some folks appreciate that and some don't
But, I got it honest

Now when I die, I may not leave my kids a fortune
But I hope they know'd my life stood for things that were important
And I'll hand out the same sturdy old values of my daddy and my momma
It made me every ounce of what I am and I got it honest

I never had to hang my head in shame
For puttin' a price tag on my name
Never turned my back on what I believe
Or let my heart be ruled by greed
'Cause brother if I didn't earn it, I don't want it

I've walked the straight and narrow
And I've worn a rebel's brand
Sometimes I've had to go without
For bein' my own man
I've rallied to the cause
When I knew the cause was right
I've cut against the grain
But I've kept my peace of mind

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me
Well, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad
Until my dyin' day
I wouldn't have it any other way
I wouldn't have it any other way
[Verse 2]
I could take a beaten path
Every time trouble starts
I'd rather take a beatin'
Than to ever cross my heart
Stickin' to my guns
Can't be sold or bought
Holdin' to my honor
No matter what the cost

[Chorus]
And I wouldn't have it any other way
If there's a price for bein' me
Well, that's one I'll have to pay
I'll take the good and bear the bad

Left a note there with the keys if it cranks, well friend, she's yours
And I struck out across Texas, gonna walk it line to line
Now I'm halfway cross New Mexico, but you're still on my mind
And this road that's going nowhere just leads me on and on
As I ask myself with every step will I ever be alone
I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too
When I left Tennessee, I thought we were through
Now I wonder how far it is over you
I was deep in California when I finally made a friend
And it was me and that old hobo till you showed up again
Then he ran out of liquor and I've run out of time

I'm standing by the ocean, but you're still on my mind
And I'm staring at the water so blue and deep and wide
Bet a man could lose a memory over on the other side

I wonder just how far it is over you
Is there no place I go that you don't come too

Somewhere out there in the smoky air
Where the night is neon blue
Surrounded by strangers, she don't know the dangers
One drink could lead her to
And if she falls, it's all my fault
For doin' a good woman wrong
I can't be far behind her, oh, Lord, help me find her
Before my angel is gone

Tell her that heaven without her feels like hell tonight

Last night when she left, I told myself
That she wouldn't go too far
Now I'm not so sure how long her tears
Could last in a stranger's arms
She's wounded, I know, and feelin' so low
She could fall at anytime
And I don't know what I'd do if I were to lose
That precious angel of mine

I’ve been watching a lot of Naruto lately so that’s why I checked it out. If you’re ever looking for a good time while people-watching, put on “Konohamaru’s Theme,” “Naruto’s Daily Life” or “Fooling Mode.”\n\nBoston to Paris:\n\nImagine my disappointment when I realized airplane mode meant I wouldn’t be able to use bluetooth connection and that I forget the dongle for my iPhone (you know, this thing). I did bring the cord for my beats though, so I checked out the music they had in their tablet things. In their hip-hop category, they had 27 albums, eight of which were in English (this was an AirFrance flight). This is when I listened to Me Against the World, Man On the Moon: The End of Day, This Unruly Mess I’ve Made and and the Anonymous Nobody. This was a 2Pac album I hadn’t heard before but other than him (and the new Kids See Ghosts), I had never given these artists a chance. Definitely was not disappointed there.\n\nThe four other English albums were Drake’s More Life, Jay-Z’s 4:44, Eminem’s Revival and the Black Panther soundtrack, but I had already heard those before. When I landed in Paris I also gave ASTROWORLD a second listen, but I’ve already listed it earlier in the month.\n\nParis to Avignon:\n\nOn the train heading South, I listened to Slime Language, LIFE’S A TRIP and Music to Die to. I definitely need to give Trippie’s album another listen. This was probably my tenth listen of MTDT. Later in the trip I revisited Slime Language for a few songs, like “Audemar,” “Chanel” and “January 1st.”\n\nAvignon to Nice:\n\nHere I listened to ONEPOINTFIVE and The Program. There were some songs on The Program that I wasn’t really feeling but maybe I just need to give them a second try. As sacrilegious as it might be (especially for a rap fan/Genius user), I’ve almost never listened to Cam. I dug ONEPOINTFIVE though.\n\nNice:\n\nI listened to Die Lit in parts on my second day in Nice and the next day, heading home. It’s funny because on my first day in Nice I heard a song in this shoe store, Nine, that I had never heard before. Even though the chorus was pretty basic I’m just like lowkey this is fire. Turns out it was Carti’s “R.I.P.” I really liked this album, gave it a second listen when I returned to Boston.\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport:\n\nWhile waiting for my first flight I listened to Simmie Season 2 and Swervo. I really wanted to listen to Simmie’s Big Smokey  but I hadn’t downloaded the songs and didn’t have wifi so I revisited SS2. Swervo was pretty good. On the second flight, the seven hour flight, I just watched a bunch of movies this time.\n\nFavorite songs:\n\nPlayboi Carti – “R.I.P.”\nwifisfuneral – “Love the Feeling” (feat. Robb Bank$)\nAminé – “SHINE”']]), ('Lil B - I’m Thraxx\n Lil B - 6 Kiss', [['Potential goal: listen to every Lil B release. By the end of the year?

Where I've got all my memories
Those were my happiest days

[Verse 1: Frida]
I remember all the games we used to play
I really do
And I went to see them almost every day
I wanted to
Though we quarreled at times
And had a few fights
We were the best of friends
We found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun
[Chorus: Björn, Agnetha & Frida]
Well there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Wildest kids you could see
We would play together
Climbing the apple tree
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother
Please take me back to that place
Where I've got all me my memories
Those were my happiest days

[Verse 2: Frida]
They would take me out for football games and such
They liked to play
And I guess I didn't like it very much
But anyway
I was happy and proud
To be with the boys
Being a little girl
I found a place in the sun
A heaven of fun

Did you see that man in the limousine?
With the pretty girl, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill

[Verse 2]
Did you see that man with a fat cigar?
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
While the rest of us drink a beer
[Chorus]
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil 'cause he wants to be
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle

[Post-Chorus]
In the middle, in the middle, in the middle...

[Verse 3]
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss
You double-cross
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling. The fact that she must resort to random chance serves to further emphasize how unlikely it is that she would become rich.\n\nLas Vegas and Monaco are the two most recognizable gambling destinations. Las Vegas is home to world famous casinos, and is almost synonymous with gambling, while Monaco is a small European country, home to the Monte Carlo Casino.']]), ('If I got me a wealthy man\n I wouldn’t have to work at all\n I’d fool around and have a ball', [['If she had a wealthy husband, she’d never have to work another day in her life.

Somehow something turns me on

Stirring in his restless sleep tonight

Gives me of his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does, and me I get so tired

Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights

And we were caught in our sleep

I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour

So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry
[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling. The fact that she must resort to random chance serves to further emphasize how unlikely it is that she would become rich.\n\nLas Vegas and Monaco are the two most recognizable gambling destinations. Las Vegas is home to world famous casinos, and is almost synonymous with gambling, while Monaco is a small European country, home to the Monte Carlo Casino.']]), ('If I got me a wealthy man\n I wouldn’t have to work at all\n I’d fool around and have a ball', [['If she had a wealthy husband, she’d never have to work another day in her life.

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling.

Las Vegas is home to world famous casinos, and is almost synonymous with gambling, while Monaco is a small European country, home to the Monte Carlo Casino.']]), ('If I got me a wealthy man\n I wouldn’t have to work at all\n I’d fool around and have a ball', [['If she had a wealthy husband, she’d never have to work another day in her life.

How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

No one to hear my prayer

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

I must have left my house at eight because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
[Verse 2: Agnetha]
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame
The day before you came

[Vocalisations: Frida]

[Verse 3: Agnetha]
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French, or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim

Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard

This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter

Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere
Maybe even when you're not there

And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me

When I kissed the teacher

He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

Down in the street they're all singing and shouting
Staying alive though the city is dead
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter
While you are crying alone in your bed
Pity, Cassandra, that no one believed you
But, then again, you were lost from the start
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would
Listen to words of warning
But on the darkest of nights
Nobody knew how to fight
And we were caught in our sleep
Sorry Cassandra, I didn't believe
You really had the power
I only saw it as dreams you would weave
Until the final hour
[Verse 2]
So in the morning your ship will be sailing
Now that your father and sister are gone
There is no reason for you to linger
You're grieving deeply ,still moving on
You know the future is casting a shadow
No one else sees it, but you know your fate
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait

[Chorus]
Sorry Cassandra, I misunderstood
Now the last day is dawning
Some of us wanted but none of us would

I only saw it as dreams you would weave

But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame
So dance while the music still goes on

You tell me it's over, what more can I say?

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling. The fact that she must resort to random chance serves to further emphasize how unlikely it is that she would become rich.\n\nLas Vegas and Monaco are the two most recognizable gambling destinations. Las Vegas is home to world famous casinos, and is almost synonymous with gambling, while Monaco is a small European country, home to the Monte Carlo Casino.']]), ('If I got me a wealthy man\n I wouldn’t have to work at all\n I’d fool around and have a ball', [['If she had a wealthy husband, she’d never have to work another day in her life.

I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine

I must have gone to lunch
At half past twelve or so, the usual place, the usual bunch

At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school

Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame

And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of ""Dallas"" that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten

Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling.

Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

No one to hear my prayer

Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win

Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

The actions of the Swedish government, regarding taxation, has affected celebrities ranging from author Astrid Lindgren to director Ingmar Bergman.\n\nLindgren famously proclaimed that her taxation rate was 102% percent in her story “Pomperipossa in Monismania”, published in March 1976; interestingly, in the story, when Pomperipossa calculates what will be left to her, the calculation gave her 2,000 kronor, which infuriated her to the point that she questioned how she would get her food, while the rest of the kronor went to the welfare state, as Expressen elaborates in 2007. “A single penny” is not a single penny in a literal sense, but a metaphor of saying that there is remaining money for a person, but not enough to sustain themselves.\n\nBergman was reportedly charged for evading taxes through a foreign company based in Switzerland that distributed films outside Sweden. While he did indeed form a distribution company, he denied that he had any intentions to bypass Sweden’s tax system, according to the New York Times. Altogether, the taxation conflicts and grievances soon became a catalyst for ousting the Social Democratic Party from being the majority party in the Riksdag in the 1976 election.\n\nAlthough this single and its accompanying album Arrival was released after the election and Lindgren’s story, The Guardian, Petter Karlsson and Jan Gradvall, in their 2014 book “ABBA: The Official Photo Book” revealed that ABBA and Polar Music avoided heavy taxation by wearing glam-inspired clothes that were to be used for only performances and not for the streets. In short, ABBA, to a certain extent, were not very fond of taxation.']]), ('So I must leave, I’ll have to go\n To Las Vegas or Monaco\n And win a fortune in a game\n My life will never be the same', [['If her rich husband is nowhere in sight, she muses that the easiest way to get the money would be through gambling. The fact that she must resort to random chance serves to further emphasize how unlikely it is that she would become rich.\n\nLas Vegas and Monaco are the two most recognizable gambling destinations. Las Vegas is home to world famous casinos, and is almost synonymous with gambling, while Monaco is a small European country, home to the Monte Carlo Casino.']]), ('If I got me a wealthy man\n I wouldn’t have to work at all\n I’d fool around and have a ball', [['If she had a wealthy husband, she’d never have to work another day in her life. Gold Digger anyone?\n\nThis plays on the double meaning of “a ball.” In this life she would “have a ball,” or have fun not working, but she might also decide to host a formal party- the sort of masquerade ball so often associated with fairy tales.']])]"

Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby
Flirt a little, maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well I can dance with you, honey
If you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?

People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
And here we go again
We know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before
And now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean
[Chorus]
Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)
Now is all we get (Ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets (Ah-ha)
Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha)
Ain't no big decision (Ah-ha)
You know what to do (Ah-ha)
La question c'est «Voulez-vous?»
Voulez-vous?

[Verse 2]
I know what you think
""The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink""
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm really glad you came
You know the rules, you know the game
Master of the scene
We've done it all before
And now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

Voulez-vous? (Ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (Ah-ha)

Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 1]
Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
Because he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
""Ah-ha-ha, it's a game he likes to play""
[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no

[Refrain]
Keep thinking about his angeleyes
I keep thinking

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same?
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah-ha-ha, how can I forget that name?

[Chorus]
Look into his angeleyes, one look and you're hypnotised
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angeleyes
Crazy 'bout his angeleyes, angeleyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price
Look into his angeleyes, you'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angeleyes
Oh no, no, no, no
