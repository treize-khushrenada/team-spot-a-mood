Your mother there to ease your head

A shooting star that had to fall

But so sore did abe ite ivvy’s holired abbles, (what with the wallhall’s horrors of rollsrights, carhacks, stonengens, kisstvanes, tramtrees, fargobawlers, autokinotons, hippohobbilies, streetfleets, tournintaxes, megaphoggs, circuses and wardsmoats and basilikerks and aeropagods and the hoyse and the jollybrool and the peeler in the coat and the mecklenburk bitch bite at his ear and the merlinburrow burrocks and his fore old porecourts, the bore the more, and his blightblack workingstacks at twelvepins a dozen and the noobibusses sleighding along Safetyfirst Street and the derryjellybies snooping around Tell-No-Tailors’ Corner and the fumes and the hopes and the strupithump of his ville’s indigenous romekeepers, homesweepers, domecreepers, thurum and thurum in fancymud murumd and all the uproor from all the aufroofs, a roof for may and a reef for hugh butt under his bridge suits tony) wan warning Phill filt tippling full. His howd feeled heavy, his hoddit did shake. (There was a wall of course in erection) Dimb! He stottered from the latter. Damb! he was dud. Dumb! Mastabatoom, mastabadtomm, when a mon merries his lute is all long. For whole the world to see.

Shize? I should shee! Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye diie? of a trying thirstay mournin? Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain’s chrissormiss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in their consternation and their duodisimally profusive plethora of ululation. There was plumbs and grumes and cheriffs and citherers and raiders and cinemen too. And the all gianed in with the shoutmost shoviality. Agog and magog and the round of them agrog. To the continuation of that celebration until Hanandhunigan’s extermination! Some in kinkin corass, more, kankan keening. Belling him up and filling him down. He’s stiff but he’s steady is Priam Olim! ’Twas he was the dacent gaylabouring youth. Sharpen his pillowscone, tap up his bier! E’erawhere in this whorl would ye hear sich a din again?

Hurrah, there is but young gleve for the owl globe wheels in view which is tautaulogically the same thing. Well, Him a being so on the flounder of his bulk like an overgrown babeling, let wee peep, see, at Hom, well, see peegee ought he ought, platterplate. Hum! From Shopalist to Bailywick or from ashtun to baronoath or from Buythebanks to Roundthehead or from the foot of the bill to ireglint’s eye he calmly extensolies. And all the way (a horn!) from fiord to fjell his baywinds’ oboboes shall wail him rockbound (hoahoahoah!) in swimswamswum and all the livvylong night, the delldale dalppling night, the night of bluerybells, her flittaflute in tricky trochees (O carina! O carina!) wake him. With her issavan essavans and her patterjackmartins about all them inns and ouses. Tilling a teel of a tum, telling a toll of a teary turty Taubling. Grace before Glutton. For what we are, gifs a gross if we are, about to believe. So pool the begg and pass the kish for crawsake. Omen. So sigh us. Grampupus is fallen down but grinny sprids the boord. Whase on the joint of a desh? Finfoefom the Fush. Whase be his baken head? A loaf of Singpantry’s Kennedy bread. And whase hitched to the hop in his tayle? A glass of Danu U’Dunnell’s foamous olde Dobbelin ayle. But, lo, as you would quaffoff his fraudstuff and sink teeth through that pyth of a flowerwhite bodey behold of him as behemoth for he is noewhemoe. Finiche! Only a fadograph of a yestern scene. Almost rubicund Salmosalar, ancient fromout the ages of the Agapemonides, he is smolten in our mist, woebecanned and packt away. So that meal’s dead off for summan, schlook, schlice and goodridhirring.

Phew!
What a warm time we were in there but how keling is here the airabouts! We nowhere she lives but you mussna tell annaone for the lamp of Jig-a-Lanthern! It’s a candlelittle houthse of a month and one windies. Downadown, High Downadown. And nummered quaintlymine. And such reasonable weather too! The wagrant wind’s awalt’zaround the piltdowns and on every blasted knollyrock (if you can spot fifty I spy four more) there’s that gnarlybird ygathering, a runalittle, doalittle, preealittle, pouralittle, wipealittle, kicksalittle, severalittle, eatalittle, whinealittle, kenalittle, helfalittle, pelfalittle gnarlybird. A verytableland of bleakbardfields! Under his seven wrothschields lies one, Lumproar. His glav toside him. Skud ontorsed. Our pigeons pair are flewn for northcliffs. The three of crows have flapped it southenly, kraaking of de baccle to the kvarters of that sky whence triboos answer; Wail, ’tis well! She niver comes out when Thon’s on shower or when Thon’s flash with his Nixy girls or when Thon’s blowing toomcracks down the gaels of Thon. No nubo no! Neblas on you liv! Her would be too moochy afreet. Of Burymeleg and Bindmerollingeyes and all the deed in the woe. Fe fo fom! She jist does hopes till byes will be byes. Here, and it goes on to appear now, she comes, a peacefugle, a parody’s bird, a peri potmother, a pringlpik in the ilandiskippy, with peewee and powwows in beggybaggy on her bickybacky and a flick flask fleckflinging its pixylighting pacts’ huemeramybows, picking here, pecking there, pussypussy plunderpussy. But it’s the armitides toonigh, militopucos, and toomourn we wish for a muddy kissmans to the minutia workers and there’s to be a gorgeups truce for happinest childher everwere. Come nebo me and suso sing the day we sallybright. She’s burrowed the coacher’s headlight the better to pry (who goes cute goes siocur and shoos aroun) and all spoiled goods go into her nabsack: curtrages and rattlin buttins, nappy spattees and flasks of all nations, clavicures and scampulars, maps, keys and woodpiles of haypennies and moonled brooches with bloodstaned breeks in em, boaston nightgarters and masses of shoesets and nickelly nacks and foder allmicheal and a lugly parson of cates and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets, ills and ells with loffs of toffs and pleures of bells and the last sigh that come fro the hart (bucklied!) and the fairest sin the sunsaw (that’s cearc!). With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross. Undo lives ‘end. Slain.
How bootifull and how truetowife of her, when strengly forebidden, to steal our historic presents from the past postpropheticals so as to will make us all lordy heirs and ladymaidesses of a pretty nice kettle of fruit. She is livving in our midst of debt and laffing through all plores for us (her birth is uncontrollable), with a naperon for her mask and her sabboes kickin arias (so sair! so solly!) if yous ask me and I saack you. Hou! Hou! Gricks may rise and Troysirs fall (there being two sights for ever a picture) for in the byways of high improvidence that’s what makes lifework leaving and the world’s a cell for citters to cit in. Let young wimman run away with the story and let young min talk smooth behind the butteler’s back. She knows her knight’s duty while Luntum sleeps. Did ye save any tin? says he. Did I what? with a grin says she. And we all like a marriedann because she is mercenary. Though the length of the land lies under liquidation (floote!) and there’s nare a hairbrow nor an eyebush on this glaubrous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter she’ll loan a vesta and hire some peat and sarch the shores her cockles to heat and she’ll do all a turfwoman can to piff the business on. Paff. To puff the blaziness on. Poffpoff. And even if Humpty shell fall frumpty times as awkward again in the beardsboosoloom of all our grand remonstrancers there’ll be iggs for the brekkers come to mournhim, sunny side up with care. So true is it that therewhere’s a turnover the tay is wet too and when you think you ketch sight of a hind make sure but you’re cocked by a hin.

Then as she is on her behaviourite job of quainance bandy, fruting for firstlings and taking her tithe, we may take our review of the two mounds to see nothing of the himples here as at elsewhere, by sixes and sevens, like so many heegills and collines, sitton aroont, scentbreeched ant somepotreek, in their swishawish satins and their taffetaffe tights, playing Wharton’s Folly, at a treepurty on the planko in the purk. Stand up, mickos! Make strake for minnas! By order, Nicholas Proud. We may see and hear nothing if we choose of the shortlegged bergins off Corkhill or the bergamoors of Arbourhill or the bergagambols of Summerhill or the bergincellies of Miseryhill or the countrybossed bergones of Constitutionhill though every crowd has its several tones and every trade has its clever mechanics and each harmonical has a point of its own, Olaf’s on the rise and Ivor’s on the lift and Sitric’s place’s between them. But all they are all there scraping along to sneeze out a likelihood that will solve and salve life’s robulous rebus, hopping round his middle like kippers on a griddle, O, as he lays dormont from the macroborg of Holdhard to the microbirg of Pied de Poudre. Behove this sound of Irish sense. Really? Here English might be seen. Royally? One sovereign punned to petery pence. Regally? The silence speaks the scene. Fake!

So This Is Dyoublong?
Hush! Caution! Echoland!

How charmingly exquisite! It reminds you of the outwashed engravure that we used to be blurring on the blotchwall of his innkempt house. Used they? (I am sure that tiring chabelshoveller with the mujikal chocolat box, Miry Mitchel, is listening) I say, the remains of the outworn gravemure where used to be blurried the Ptollmens of the Incabus. Used we? (He is only pretendant to be stugging at the jubalee harp from a second existed lishener, Fiery Farrelly.) It is well known. Lokk for himself and see the old butte new. Dbln. W. K. O. O. Hear? By the mausolime wall. Fimfim fimfim. With a grand funferall. Fumfum fumfum. ’Tis optophone which ontophanes. List! Wheatstone’s magic lyer. They will be tuggling foriver. They will be lichening for allof. They will be pretumbling forover. The harpsdischord shall be theirs for ollaves.
Four things therefore, saith our herodotary Mammon Lujius in his grand old historiorum, wrote near Boriorum, bluest book in baile’s annals, f t. in Dyffinarsky ne’er sall fail til heathersmoke and cloudweed Eire’s ile sall pall. And here now they are, the fear of um. T. Totities! Unum. (Adar.) A bulbenboss surmounted upon an alderman. Ay, ay! Duum. (Nizam.) A shoe on a puir old wobban. Ah, ho! Triom. (Tamuz.) An auburn mayde, o’brine a’bride, to be desarted. Adear, adear! Quodlibus. (Marchessvan.) A penn no weightier nor a polepost. And so. And all. (Succoth.)

So, how idlers’ wind turning pages on pages, as innocens with anaclete play popeye antipop, the leaves of the living in the boke of the deeds, annals of themselves timing the cycles of events grand and national, bring fassilwise to pass how.

1132 A.D. Men like to ants or emmets wondern upon a groot hwide Whallfisk which lay in a Runnel. Blubby wares upat Ublanium.
566 A.D. On Baalfire’s night of this year after deluge a crone that hadde a wickered Kish for to hale dead tunes from the bog lookit under the blay of her Kish as she ran for to sothisfeige her cowrieosity and be me sawl but she found hersell sackvulle of swart goody quickenshoon ant small illigant brogues, so rich in sweat. Blurry works at Hurdlesford.

566 A.D. At this time it fell out that a brazenlockt damsel grieved (sobralasolas!) because that Puppette her minion was ravisht of her by the ogre Puropeus Pious. Bloody wars in Ballyaughacleeaghbally.
1132. A.D. Two sons at an hour were born until a goodman and his hag. These sons called themselves Caddy and Primas. Primas was a santryman and drilled all decent people. Caddy went to Winehouse and wrote o peace a farce. Blotty words for Dublin.

Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antediluvious and annadominant the copyist must have fled with his scroll. The billy flood rose or an elk charged him or the sultrup worldwright from the excelsissimost empyrean (bolt, in sum) earthspake or the Dannamen gallous banged pan the bliddy duran. A scribicide then and there is led off under old’s code with some fine covered by six marks or ninepins in metalmen for the sake of his labour’s dross while it will be only now and again in our rear of o’er era, as an upshoot of military and civil engagements, that a gynecure was let on to the scuffold for taking that same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the drawers of his neighbour’s safe.
Now after all that farfatch’d and peragrine or dingnant or clere lift we our ears, eyes of the darkness, from the tome of Liber Lividus and, (toh!), how paisibly eirenical, all dimmering dunes and gloamering glades, selfstretches afore us our fredeland’s plain! Lean neath stone pine the pastor lies with his crook; young pricket by pricket’s sister nibbleth on returned viridities; amaid her rocking grasses the herb trinity shams lowliness; skyup is of evergrey. Thus, too, for donkey’s years. Since the bouts of Hebear and Hairyman the cornflowers have been staying at Ballymun, the duskrose has choosed out Goatstown’s hedges, twolips have pressed togatherthem by sweet Rush, townland of twinedlights, the whitethorn and the redthorn have fairygeyed the mayvalleys of Knockmaroon, and, though for rings round them, during a chiliad of perihelygangs, the Formoreans have brittled the tooath of the Danes and the Oxman has been pestered by the Firebugs and the Joynts have thrown up jerrybuilding to the Kevanses and Little on the Green is childsfather to the City (Year! Year! And laughtears!), these paxsealing buttonholes have quadrilled across the centuries and whiff now whafft to us, fresh and made-of-all-smiles as, on the eve of Killallwho.

The babbelers with their thangas vain have been (confusium hold them!) they were and went; thigging thugs were and houhnhymn songtoms were and comely norgels were and pollyfool fiansees. Menn have thawed, clerks have surssurhummed, the blond has sought of the brune: Elsekiss thou may, mean Kerry piggy?: and the duncledames have countered with the hellish fellows: Who ails tongue coddeau, aspace of dumbillsilly? And they fell upong one another: and themselves they have fallen. And still nowanights and by nights of yore do all bold floras of the field to their shyfaun lovers say only: Cull me ere I wilt to thee!: and, but a little later: Pluck me whilst I blush! Well may they wilt, marry, and profusedly blush, be troth! For that saying is as old as the howitts. Lave a whale a while in a whillbarrow (isn’t it the truath I’m tallin ye?) to have fins and flippers that shimmy and shake. Tim Timmycan timped hir, tampting Tam. Fleppety! Flippety! Fleapow!
Hop!

Many. Miscegenations on miscegenations. Tieckle. They lived und laughed ant loved end left. Forsin. Thy thingdome is given to the Meades and Porsons. The meandertale, aloss and again, of our old Heidenburgh in the days when HeadinClouds walked the earth. In the ignorance that implies impression that knits knowledge that finds the nameform that whets the wits that convey contacts that sweeten sensation that drives desire that adheres to attachment that dogs death that bitches birth that entails the ensuance of existentiality. But with a rush out of his navel reaching the reredos of Ramasbatham. A terricolous vivelyonview this; queer and it continues to be quaky. A hatch, a celt, an earshare the pourquose of which was to cassay the earthcrust at all of hours, furrowards, bagawards, like yoxen at the turnpaht. Here say figurines billycoose arming and mounting. Mounting and arming bellicose figurines see here. Futhorc, this liffle effingee is for a firefing called a flintforfall. Face at the eased! O I fay! Face at the waist! Ho, you fie! Upwap and dump em, ace to ace! When a part so ptee does duty for the holos we soon grow to use of an allforabit.

It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, when Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy to his lovesaking eyes and everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else, and Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-of-his-inlaw, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up and fireland was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace o’malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother’s in a brace of samers and the jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl von Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankquean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her madesty. So her madesty ‘a forethought’ set down a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman’s Land she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop. But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to touch him his tears and she provorted him to the onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl von Hoother’s and the Larryhill with her under her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm? And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), ant the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling. And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of porter pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like the campbells acoming with a fork lance of lightning, Jarl von Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves and his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his furframed panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen orangeman in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman’s bill. And he clopped his rude hand to his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Perkodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurthrumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.

Now be aisy, good Mr Finnimore, sir. And take your laysure like a god on pension and don’t be walking abroad. Sure you’d only lose yourself in Healiopolis now the way your roads in Kapelavaster are that winding there after the calvary, the North Umbrian and the Fivs Barrow and Waddlings Raid and the Bower Moore and wet your feet maybe with the foggy dew’s abroad. Meeting some sick old bankrupt or the Cottericks’ donkey with his shoe hanging, clankatachankata, or a slut snoring with an impure infant on a bench. ‘Twould turn you against life, so ‘twould. And the weather’s that mean too. To part from Devlin is hard as Nugent knew, to leave the clean tanglesome one lushier than its neighbour enfranchisable fields but let your ghost have no grievance. You’re better off, sir, where you are, primesigned in the full of your dress, bloodeagle waistcoat and all, remembering your shapes and sizes on the pillow of your babycurls under your sycamore by the keld water where the Tory’s clay will scare the varmints and have all you want, pouch, gloves, flask, bricket, kerchief, ring and amberulla, the whole treasure of the pyre, in the land of souls with Homin and Broin Baroke and pole ole Lonan and Nobucketnozzler and the Guinnghis Khan. And we’ll be coming here, the ombre players, to rake your gravel and bringing you presents, won’t we, fenians? And il isn’t our spittle we’ll stint you of, is it, druids? Not shabbty little imagettes, pennydirts and dodgemyeyes you buy in the soottee stores. But offerings of the field.

Mieliodories, that Doctor Faherty, the madison man, taught to gooden you. Poppypap’s a passport out. And honey is the holiest thing ever was, hive, comb and earwax, the food for glory, (mind you keep the pot or your nectar cup may yield too light!) and some goat’s milk, sir, like the maid used to bring you. Your fame is spreading like Basilico’s ointment since the Fintan Lalors piped you overborder and there’s whole households beyond the Bothnians and they calling names after you. The menhere’s always talking of you sitting around on the pig’s cheeks under the sacred rooftree, over the bowls of memory where every hollow holds a hallow, with a pledge till the drengs, in the Salmon House. And admiring to our supershillelagh where the palmsweat on high is the mark of your manument. All the toethpicks ever Eirenesians chewed on are chips chepped from that battery block. If you were bowed and soild and letdown itself from the oner of the load it was that paddyplanters might pack up plenty and when you were undone in every point fore the laps of goddesses you showed our labourlasses how to free was easy.

He’s duddandgunne now and we’re apter finding the sores of his sedeq but peace to his great limbs, the buddhoch, with the last league long rest of him, while the millioncandled eye of Tuskar sweeps the Moylean Main! There was never a warlord in Great Erinnes and Brettland, no, nor in all Pike County like you, they say. No, nor a king nor an ardking, bung king, sung king or hung king.

Mick Mac Magnus MacCawley can take you off to the pure perfection and Leatherbags Reynolds tries your shuffle and cut. But as Hopkins and Hopkins puts it, you were the pale eggynaggy and a kis to tilly up. We calls him the journeyall Buggaloffs since he went Jerusalemfaring in Arssia Manor. You had a gamier cock than Pete, Jake or Martin and your archgoose of geese stubbled for All Angels’ Day. So may the priest of seven worms and scalding tayboil, Papa Vestray, come never anear you as your hair grows wheater beside the Liffey that’s in Heaven! Hep, hep, hurrah there! Hero! Seven times thereto we salute you! The whole bag of kits, falconplumes and jackboots incloted, is where you flung them that time. Your heart is in the system of the Shewolf and your crested head is in the tropic of Copricapron. Your feet are in the cloister of Virgo. Your olala is in the region of sahuls. And that’s ashore as you were born. Your shuck tick’s swell. And that there texas is tow linen. The loamsome roam to Laffayette is ended. Drop in your tracks, babe! Be not unrested! The headboddylwatcher of the chempel of Isid, Totumcalmum, saith: I know thee, metherjar, I know thee, salvation boat. For we have performed upon thee, thou abramanation, who comest ever without being invoked, whose coming is unknown, all the things which the company of the precentors and of the grammarians of Christpatrick’s ordered concerning thee in the matter of the work of thy tombing. Howe of the shipmen, steep wall!

Everything’s going on the same or so it appeals to all of us, in the old holmsted here. Coughings all over the sanctuary, bad scrant to me aunt Florenza. The horn for breakfast, one o’gong for lunch and dinnerchime. As popular as when Belly the First was keng and his members met in the Diet of Man. The same shop slop in the window. Jacob’s lettercrackers and Dr Tipple’s Vi–Cocoa and the Eswuards’ desippated soup beside Mother Seagull’s syrup. Meat took a drop when Reilly–Parsons failed. Coal’s short but we’ve plenty of bog in the yard. And barley’s up again, begrained to it. The lads is attending school nessans regular, sir, spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by mudapplication. Allfor the books and never pegging smashers after Tom Bowe Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser. ‘Tisraely the truth! No isn’t it, roman pathoricks? You were the doublejoynted janitor the morning they were delivered and you’ll be a grandfer yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows. Kevin’s just a doat with his cherub cheek, chalking oghres on walls, and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, playing postman’s knock round the diggings and if the seep were milk you could lieve his olde by his ide but, laus sake, the devil does be in that knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, making encostive inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing a blue streak over his bourseday shirt. Hetty Jane’s a child of Mary. She’ll be coming (for they’re sure to choose her) in her white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle the flame on Felix Day. But Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts. You remember Essie in our Luna’s Convent? They called her Holly Merry her lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williamswoodsmenufactors I’d poster those pouters on every jamb in the town. She’s making her rep at Lanner’s twicenightly. With the tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees. Beats that cachucha flat. ‘Twould dilate your heart to go.

Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and repose your honour’s lordship! Hold him here, Ezekiel Irons, and may God strengthen you! It’s our warm spirits, boys, he’s spooring. Dimitrius O’Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys! You swamped enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy. Fetch neahere, Pat Koy! And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates! Be nayther angst of Wramawitch! Here’s lumbos. Where misties swaddlum, where misches lodge none, where mystries pour kind on, O sleepy! So be yet!

I’ve an eye on queer Behan and old Kate and the butter, trust me. She’ll do no jugglywuggly with her war souvenir postcards to help to build me murial, tippers! I’ll trip your traps! Assure a sure there! And we put on your clock again, sir, for you. Did or didn’t we, sharestutterers? So you won’t be up a stump entirely. Nor shed your remnants. The sternwheel’s crawling strong. I seen your missus in the hall. Like the queenoveire. Arrah, it’s herself that’s fine, too, don’t be talking! Shirksends? You storyan Harry chap longa me Harry chap storyan grass woman plelthy good trout. Shakeshands. Dibble a hayfork’s wrong with her only her lex’s salig. Boald Tib does be yawning and smirking cat’s hours on the Pollockses’ woolly round tabouretcushion watching her sewing a dream together, the tailor’s daughter, stitch to her last. Or while waiting for winter to fire the enchantement, decoying more nesters to fall down the flue. It’s allavalonche that blows nopussy food. If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips would moisten once again. As when you drove with her to Findrinny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger’s bride. She was flirtsome then and she’s fluttersome yet. She can second a song and adores a scandal when the last post’s gone by. Fond of a concertina and pairs passing when she’s had her forty winks for supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her merlin chair assotted, reading her Evening World. To see is it smarts, full lengths or swaggers. News, news, all the news. Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez. Angry scenes at Stormount. Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways.

Opportunity fair with the China floods and we hear these rosy rumours. Ding Tams he noise about all same Harry chap. She’s seeking her way, a chickle a chuckle, in and out of their serial story, Les Loves of Selskar et Pervenche, freely adapted to The Novvergin’s Viv. There’ll be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres the night she signs her final tear. Zee End. But that’s a world of ways away. Till track laws time. No silver ash or switches for that one! While flattering candles flare. Anna Stacey’s how are you! Worther waist in the noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay actionneers. Her hair’s as brown as ever it was. And wivvy and wavy. Repose you now! Finn no more!

For, be that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon, there’s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises of his haunt of the hungred bordles, as it is told me. Shop Illicit, flourishing like a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop a deadlop (aloose!) to lee but lifting a bennbranch a yardalong (Ivoeh!) the breezy side (for showm!), the height of Brewster’s chimpney and as broad below as Phineas Barnum; humphing his share of the showthers is senken on him he’s such a grandfallar, with a pocked wife in pickle that’s a flyfire and three lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit pucelle. And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what your fourfootlers saw or he was never done seeing what you coolpigeons know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, and that’ll do now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees. Though Eset fibble it to the zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round her heavens for ever. Creator he has created for his creatured ones a creation. White monothoid? Red theatrocrat? And all the pinkprophets cohalething? Very much so! But however ’twas ’tis sure for one thing, what sherif Toragh voucherfors and Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the Cheapner, Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the naym, came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial fermament one tide on another, with a bumrush in a hull of a wherry, the twin turbane dhow, The Bey for Dybbling, this archipelago’s first visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern waxenwench at her prow for a figurehead, the deadsea dugong updipdripping from his depths, and has been repreaching himself like a fishmummer these siktyten years ever since, his shebi by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his turban and changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut’s cess to him!) as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when innebbiated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous from his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was put under him, in lashons of languages, (honnein suit and praisers be!) and, totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim that he, sober serious, he is ee and no counter he who will be ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough.17Embed"

[Verse 1]
I walked along the avenue
I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you
With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotise me through
Hypnotise me through

[Chorus]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away
[Verse 2]
A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you
The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

[Chorus]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
I couldn't get away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Appearing from my view
Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

[Chorus]
And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day

A dying (?)
Another coke, another lie

Searching for a love that has no pain

Awoke from mind inearth
Conscious enveloping, sick feat over

I returned undefeated
From whence others fear to tread
Time to fling another barrage at desideratum
Last rites retracted

So I'm trying to remember where I was
When I lost sight of the flickering sun
Perhaps to recall the beginning of
The downfall of it all
The rainbow drain-bowed
Ember's colour became as grey
On the day when perspectives lengthened
When what had seemed before to be so far away
Became to me so shockingly, starkly, clear
Face down in ash, choking in frenzy
Soon to become a meal for the many
As smiling eyes to glittering ice
Worm voices rising through all this putrefaction
Awaiting loss in less than resignation
To finish the start a tempting frustration
Fully expecting subterfuge, in a place of no refuge
No last chances for this sleighted hand
Away, away, lying through the last stand
Dead heat, soul on ice, all wishes wasted
Dreaming pure horror
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie

Painting out cracked windows of the soul
In misty midnight black
Serrated blades of silver hatred
Ragged cuts pissing blood
Torn through gossamer thin desire
All hope and fear feeding funeral pyres

Has now passed on

And waited for the end to start
Sparks flew from chains dragged in servitude
Watching colours fail
And brightness turn to programmed dusk
While tears burnt tracks in cold stone
All future to disappear beneath layers of sorrow
Stone-clad solitude, rain lashed epitaph
All earthly shells divide, divide by zero
We ignored the men stamping out the future
And smiled at the cathode rays
Drizzle crawled over cracked portals to nowhere
Afraid to face the grey infiltrating our bored darkness
While rainbows feigned ignorance
All past lost in a deluge of tedium

All flesh corrupt, rot to multiply

Beating out an old tattoo

Delaying the inevitable as seasons become as one
All encompassing winter of servitude
All is as nothing, all has nothing to become
She cried, she cried, as all summer fell
Took the Final by the scruff of its dirty neck
And flung it far into forever!

Waiting for delay to progress lost its appeal
Shifting our weight against this seasonless somewhere
Embroiled in a twisting universe simulated and unreal
The final curtain fell, and fell, and fell
Leaving cleansing, crushing darkness to fend for herself
Leached of colour, evolution gone full circle from tail, to head, to putrefaction

Starting to end all over again

There are tears all over town
Too many tears
Once there were trumpets in the air
And confetti in your hair
And I knew where I belonged
Now I'm singing you this song

And every star we held that night
We reached for it all, you know we tried

But there are tears all over town
Too many tears all over this town
There are tears all over town
Too many tears

I'm scattered like newspapers all over the streets
I see your face in everyone I meet
I'm avoiding the corners, I'm avoiding your name
I know that I loved you, but I loved you in vain

And this city is too small for two
My melancholy friend and you

She's seen your face, her mother's mentioned once your name
She sits and dreams her fifteen-year-old dreams of what to do
She's heard you sing and that your eyes are very very very blue

Why do you run?
Why do you hide
From all you are?
You're just a man
But she could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside
She could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside
She has a home outside this little picture frame
You're not in it and she wants someone to blame
Do you remember what it's like to be that young?
All the pages that are blank and all the songs yet to be sung

Why do you run?
Why do you hide
From all she is?
She's just a girl
Girls can tear you up inside
Tear you up inside
They could tear you up inside
Tear you up inside

If there are words you want to say
She's waiting for that rainy, that rainy day

Why do you run?
Why do you hide
From all she is?

You rid my heart of every bit of malice, baby
You're how I won the war
Now your bags are packed, you're walking out the door
In every way there is nothing to say anymore

Maybe the tears will never dry
This is the long goodbye

You take your records, leave me mine
You're the one who said we lived it all on borrowed time
So at the end of the day
There was nothing to say anymore
This is the long goodbye
Maybe the tears will never dry
This is the long goodbye
Leaving the past and you behind
This is the long goodbye

So take a good look, make it last
And when you've found the moment's passed
Just remember that nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you like me
Nobody loved you... like me

I was told the tale;
Star-crossed lovers' final stand
A butchered destiny has failed
This is the story
Straight from his ghostly mind
Of the love
The life
And the death he left behind...

A lonely tumbleweed creeps
And rolls down these blood-covered streets
I will exact revenge;
Will bring death to this place
This is my solemn vow;
I'll leave without a trace...
My shot rings out loud
Awakening the town
The man in black, she's in his grasp
Boy put that barrell down
Or you're all gonna die....
Unhand that gir, son, she's done nothing wrong
Those big doe eyes and bright red lips
Have got me won
Don't worry baby, their blood and makeup
Will be spilled soon all across this town...

I pull the Holy iron from the holster;
I see the greedy fire in his eyes as he gets bolder
This day would bring his death
He knows not who he threatens
I never will take my last breath;
Appointed by the heavens...

(You will not survive to see the night)

I cannot die, I am divine
Unhand the girl, her love is mine
His smile grows... Oh, God, he knows...
Her eyes get wider, the scene grows beside her
The town has gathered to watch the duel
The New Gemorrha has played me for a fool
I make my move; he's just as fast
I hear her cry, it is her last

I'll be back
Innocent blood is on your hands
Death cannot stop me;
My spirit will haunt this land

I rise;
Sacrifice has fullfilled my wish
The man in black stares;
He's scared...
So scared....

I'll have my revenge
These streets will run red.......Embed"

Listen up Boy

Shed the burden of this visage;
Take off the mask, ignore the mirage...
Do not listen, you are your own
Rollow your own path, reap what you sow

Nero's fingertips, like a noose around the neck, nimbly dancing until rubble is all that's left. Thumbs down for you, gladiator, your black grown flooding Hades. Marching down, step by step, a faux facade parade
Baby boy, you've got to go...

Baby boy, you know there's nothing to see
So listen up, hear me out, and face the reality
That you don't know me;
You think that you own me;
I don't care about a single thing
That you show me

They should be watchin their toes
When the names start droppin'
And your ego show shows

Together forever and no one has to know…

Why are you smiling, what have you done?
Where is my darling, where has she gone?

It’s a lover’s embrace without the lovers
It’s the thrill of the chase without the hunters!

Our embrace carried us into town
No longer alone, their eyes on fingertips and throwing ghosts
You know who you are; you know what you’ve done
I know where you are and what you have become
I justify my right tonight to take these words, sharp as a knife
And gut your memory, severing the ties that bind
You were my Judas; your lips still burn my cheek
You were a liar

Imprisoned to this ball and chain
If I cannot break it am I able to be Cain?
I cannot love
I shall not hate
I will give anything to feel it’s not too late

It’s betrayal from one soul another
It’s a fury that burns with all the others
It’s emancipation. Infatuation. Desecration

I cannot live. You will not die. I cannot live while you are alive

You are dead to me

We are your faith denied. We are your jealous screams
We are the murdered. We are the murderers

In a single dark room, they were singing the tune
You spoke in tongues cut out, mimicked words of those devout

No guns, no glory, no heroes in this story
Just the words of a fool, the thoughts of a king, and a heart that screams fury

I wanna know, if you had this stage what would you say and could I sing along?
Or would you convince me there's nothing left and that all hope is gone?

So I need a jump-start, baby. I need a new heart, yeah?
I need a way to find myself without falling apart
So I need a new mask maybe. This face just will not last
I will seek you out; I will never bring you back
I'm walking around trying how to find the sound
Of planes crashing and pilots swearing off the ground
Mayday! Mayday! We're going down! Our blaze of glory's been found!
Sound the air raid Siren, hope is dying, hope is dying!

She was a first-class mistress

When they skinned me alive you were not by my side
In a single dark room, they were singing the tune
And when my tongue came out you were nowhere to be found

I will not believe! You see you've got something to prove to me
I will not, I cannot, I do not believe. You see you've got, you've got something to prove to me

So I need a jump-start, baby. I need a new heart, yeah?
I need a way to find myself without falling apart
So I need a new mask maybe. This face just will not last

Their tendons sing like piano wire
Their muscles solid, forged from the strongest iron
Why am I the last machine?
Where is my skin graft, so human, pure and so very clean?

(Lonely like a memory)
Why am I finding myself all alone?
I'm a furnace-fed scarecrow in a field of bones
They've all given in what do they have to show?
Existing in servitude, they'll reap what they've sown
I can tell you what it's like to die
Stand up to the reaper while burning inside
If you don't believe just look in these eyes…
I can show you what lonely is like
We are broken, we are rusting slowly
We are burning and we are holy
Crawling along on these cast-iron knees
To the coal miner's song soaking up the disease
They are changing, but their flesh I'm denied
They are mortal; I'm still rusting inside
I see the speaker with my X-Ray eyes
I see his determined and rotting insides

With these circumstances I think it's quite obvious
He'd like to take a chance to speak for the rest of us
""Reach your roots elsewhere, fresh muscles are restless!""
Their shuffling footsteps, like young children, helpless…

'Bury the children. Carry the children. They'll be cozy in their graves.'

When your breath gets weak and your vision's cloudy whose name will you call out?

Their eyes are glazed as they are carried away
Their wishes have all come true, but their words were twisted and construed
'The grave is waiting for their arrogance!'
Through barbed wire and borrowed tongues they cry ""Save us from this penance!""
Now I'm left behind, but I'm alive!

How I yearned to shed this shell
I am alone in this carbon hell
They have changed; they're still to blame
With the same smile, the same style, and the same shame
You might also likeI will carry their burdens on my back
Remove this label of martyr, that's all I ask

'Just who do you think you are?'

They call me Atlas. I am a Titan
I'll be your savior
They call me Atlas. I am a Titan
Come with me my children…
We'll ride the lightning home

You will return to what you once were
Follow the sound of my voice, your prayers have been heard

Innocence is ignorance so run, as fast as you can, away from these men;
These full-moon eyes are for you

We are all just miserable. We are all just machinesEmbed"

I am the law of the youth; I'm armed to control, not protect
Childhood's spent in school to teach them the ways of the world
Then send them to work and to war 'cause this system's what they reject

Fuck you, you bastards!

I feed them my morals to live, for the state and the organized church
Anyone who thinks for themself is different and doesn't belong
These kids are rebellious and now they need to be stopped right away
They have no respect for the and their will to live is too strong
Fuck you, you bastards!

They don't want a revolution
But a change in power's the only solution
Take your laws away
Fuck the world and fuck my peers; I won't forget the past 18 years
And I won't regret the rest from this day

Order was established for us; decisions made before we were born
That's how it is and how it will be we live in conditions we hate
The next generation is here; we don't have to live by their rules
Respect and compassion are void, but for us, it's not too late

Fuck you, you bastards!

The way it is, is the way it was and the way it will stay
Just because so many of us just accept it without a fight

Fight back for your right to live any way you want to be
Fuck those who refuse to accept your individuality
Fuck those who control our future, mentally beating us down

Yo, hello?

[Verse 1]
You know, you don't have to have
A gun in your back to be a slave
It's not that necessary
If that's all people want from you
A lot of things that seem harmless, you know
Are quite more dangerous than you might think
Pop culture: look at what's on the television
The radio, and the magazines
Everywhere you go, what do you see?
The same and more nonsense
To cloud your mind from the reality

More products, but absolutely no thought
A fantasy for people to keep facing
""Forget about the war, forget how hard it is to get by
Just keep dancing and keep eye,"" that's all they tell you

Not everybody buys it
Some people raise their own voice
And create their own culture
Something that has to do with them
And how they see the world
Then the system takes it
And sells it back in a plastic, safe, whitewash form

Now it's pop culture, introducing the same values
That everything's okay
The cop is your friend, your boss is your friend
Law and order

[Outro]
All we can really hope for
Is that some people won't take it
When the system tries to take their voice
And sell it back to them again

**I. Introduction**

The Columbian Exchange transformed both sides of the Atlantic, but with dramatically disparate outcomes. New diseases wiped out entire civilizations in the Americas, while newly imported nutrient-rich foodstuffs enabled a European population boom. Spain benefited most immediately as the wealth of the Aztec and Incan Empires strengthened the Spanish monarchy. Spain used its new riches to gain an advantage over other European nations, but this advantage was soon contested.Puritan.”

Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and England all raced to the New World, eager to match the gains of the Spanish. Native peoples greeted the new visitors with responses ranging from welcome cooperation to aggressive violence, but the ravages of disease and the possibility of new trading relationships enabled Europeans to create settlements all along the western rim of the Atlantic world. New empires would emerge from these tenuous beginnings, and by the end of the seventeenth century, Spain would lose its privileged position to its rivals. An age of colonization had begun and, with it, a great collision of cultures commenced.


**II. Spanish America**
Spain extended its reach in the Americas after reaping the benefits of its colonies in Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. Expeditions slowly began combing the continent and bringing Europeans into the modern-day United States in the hopes of establishing religious and economic dominance in a new territory.

Juan Ponce de Leon arrived in the area named “La Florida” in 1513. He found between 150,000 and 300,000 Native Americans. But then two-and-a-half centuries of contact with European and African peoples–whether through war, slave raids, or, most dramtically, foreign disease–decimated Florida’s indigenous population. European explorers, meanwhile, had hoped to find great wealth in Florida, but reality never aligned with their imaginations.

In the first half of the sixteenth century, Spanish colonizers fought frequently with Florida’s native peoples as well as with other Europeans. In the 1560s Spain expelled French Protestants, called Huguenots, from the area near modern-day Jacksonville in northeast Florida. In 1586 English privateer Sir Francis Drake burned the wooden settlement of St. Augustine. At the dawn of the seventeenth century, Spain’s reach in Florida extended from the mouth of the St. Johns River south to the environs of St. Augustine—an area of roughly 1,000 square miles. The Spaniards attempted to duplicate methods for establishing control used previously in Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Andes. The Crown granted missionaries the right to live among Timucua and Guale villagers in the late 1500s and early 1600s and encouraged settlement through the encomienda system (grants of Indian labor).

In the 1630s, the mission system extended into the Apalachee district in the Florida panhandle. The Apalachee, one of the most powerful tribes in Florida at the time of contact, claimed the territory from the modern Florida-Georgia border to the Gulf of Mexico. Apalachee farmers grew an abundance of corn and other crops. Indian traders carried surplus products east along the Camino Real, the royal road that connected the western anchor of the mission system with St. Augustine. Spanish settlers drove cattle eastward across the St. Johns River and established ranches as far west as Apalachee. Still, Spain held Florida tenuously.

Further west, Juan de Oñate led 400 settlers, soldiers, and missionaries from Mexico into New Mexico in 1598. The Spanish Southwest had brutal beginnings. When Oñate sacked the Pueblo city of Acoma, the “sky city,” the Spaniards slaughtered nearly half of its roughly 1,500 inhabitants, including women and children. Oñate ordered one foot cut off of every surviving male over 15 and he enslaved the remaining women and children.1

Santa Fe, the first permanent European settlement in the Southwest, was established in 1610. Few Spaniards relocated to the southwest due to the distance from Mexico City and the dry and hostile environment. Thus, the Spanish never achieved a commanding presence in the region. By 1680, only about 3,000 colonists called Spanish New Mexico home. There, they traded with and exploited the local Puebloan peoples. The region’s Puebloan population had plummeted from as many as 60,000 in 1600 to about 17,000 in 1680.

Spain shifted strategies after the military expeditions wove their way through the southern and western half of North America. Missions became the engine of colonization in North America. Missionaries, most of whom were members of the Franciscan religious order, provided Spain with an advance guard in North America. Catholicism had always justified Spanish conquest, and colonization always carried religious imperatives. By the early seventeenth century, Spanish friars established dozens of missions along the Rio Grande, in New Mexico, and in California.


**III. Spain’s Rivals Emerge**

While Spain plundered the New World, unrest plagued Europe. The Reformation threw England and France, the two European powers capable of contesting Spain, into turmoil. Long and expensive conflicts drained time, resources, and lives. Millions died from religious violence in France alone. As the violence diminished in Europe, however, religious and political rivalries continued in the New World.

The Spanish exploitation of New Spain’s riches inspired European monarchs to invest in exploration and conquest. Reports of Spanish atrocities spread throughout Europe and provided a humanitarian justification for European colonization. An English reprint of the writings of Bartolomé de las Casas bore the sensational title: “Popery Truly Display’d in its Bloody Colours: Or, a Faithful Narrative of the Horrid and Unexampled Massacres, Butcheries, and all manners of Cruelties that Hell and Malice could invent, committed by the Popish Spanish.” An English writer explained that the Indians “were simple and plain men, and lived without great labour,” but in their lust for gold the Spaniards “forced the people (that were not used to labour) to stand all the daie in the hot sun gathering gold in the sand of the rivers. By this means a great nombre of them (not used to such pains) died, and a great number of them (seeing themselves brought from so quiet a life to such misery and slavery) of desperation killed themselves. And many would not marry, because they would not have their children slaves to the Spaniards.”2 The Spanish accused their critics of fostering a “Black Legend.” The Black Legend drew on religious differences and political rivalries. Spain had successful conquests in France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and left many in those nations yearning to break free from Spanish influence. English writers argued that Spanish barbarities were foiling a tremendous opportunity for the expansion of Christianity across the globe and that a benevolent conquest of the New World by non-Spanish monarchies offered the surest salvation of the New World’s pagan masses. With these religious justifications, and with obvious economic motives, Spain’s rivals arrived in the New World.



The French

The French crown subsidized exploration in the early sixteenth century. Early French explorers sought a fabled Northwest Passage, a mythical waterway passing through the North American continent to Asia. Despite the wealth of the New World, Asia’s riches still beckoned to Europeans. Canada’s Saint Lawrence River at first glance appeared to be such a passage, stretching deep into the continent and into the Great Lakes. French colonial possessions centered on these bodies of water (and, later, down the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans).
French colonization developed through investment from private trading companies. Traders established Port-Royal in Acadia (Nova Scotia) in 1603 and launched trading expeditions that stretched down the Atlantic coast as far as Cape Cod. The needs of the fur trade set the future pattern of French colonization. Founded in 1608 under the leadership of Samuel de Champlain, Quebec provided the foothold for what would become New France. French fur traders placed a higher value on cooperating with the Indians than on establishing a successful French colonial footprint. Asserting dominance in the region could have been to their own detriment, as it may have compromised their access to skilled trappers, and therefore wealth. Few Frenchmen traveled to the New World to settle permanently. In fact, few traveled at all. Many persecuted French Protestants (Huguenots) sought to emigrate after France criminalized Protestantism in 1685, but all non-Catholics were forbidden in New France.

The French preference for trade over permanent settlement fostered more cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships with Native Americans than was typical among the Spanish and English. Perhaps eager to debunk the anti-Catholic elements of the Black Legend, the French worked to cultivate cooperation with Indians. Jesuit missionaries, for instance, adopted different conversion strategies than the Spanish Franciscans. Spanish missionaries brought Indians into enclosed missions, whereas Jesuits more often lived with or alongside Indian groups. Many French fur traders married Indian women. The offspring of Indian women and French men were so common in New France that the French developed a word for these children, Métis(sage). The Huron people developed a particularly close relationship with the French and many converted to Christianity and engaged in the fur trade. But close relationships with the French would come at a high cost. The Huron, for instance, were decimated by the ravages of European disease, and entanglements in French and Dutch conflicts proved disastrous. Despite this, some native peoples maintained distant alliances with the French.

Pressure from the powerful Iroquois in the east pushed many Algonquian-speaking peoples toward French territory in the mid-seventeenth century and together they crafted what historians have called a “middle ground,” where Europeans and natives crafted a kind of cross-cultural space that allowed for native and European interaction, negotiation, and accommodation. French traders adopted–sometimes clumsily–the gift-giving and mediation strategies expected of native leaders and natives engaged the impersonal European market and submitted–often haphazardly–to European laws. The Great Lakes “middle ground” experienced tumultuous success throughout the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries until English colonial officials and American settlers swarmed the region. The pressures of European expansion strained even the closest bonds.3



The Dutch

The Netherlands, a small maritime nation with great wealth, achieved considerable colonial success. In 1581, the Netherlands had officially broken away from the Hapsburgs and won a reputation as the freest of the new European nations. Dutch women maintained separate legal identities from their husbands and could therefore hold property and inherit full estates.

Ravaged by the turmoil of the Reformation, the Dutch embraced greater religious tolerance and freedom of the press than other European nations. Radical Protestants, Catholics, and Jews flocked to the Netherlands. The English Pilgrims, for instance, fled first to Holland before sailing to the New World years later. The Netherlands built its colonial empire through the work of experienced merchants and skilled sailors. The Dutch were the most advanced capitalists in the modern world and marshaled extensive financial resources by creating innovative financial organizations such as the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the East India Company. Although the Dutch offered liberties, they offered very little democracy—power remained in the hands of only a few. And even Dutch liberties had their limits. The Dutch advanced the slave trade and brought African slaves with them to the New World. Slavery was an essential part of Dutch capitalist triumphs.

Sharing the European hunger for access to Asia, in 1609 the Dutch commissioned the Englishman Henry Hudson to discover the fabled Northwest Passage through North America. He failed, of course, but nevertheless found the Hudson River and claimed modern-day New York for the Dutch. There they established New Netherlands, an essential part of the Netherlands’ New World empire. The Netherlands chartered the Dutch West India Company in 1621 and established colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and North America. The island of Manhattan provided a launching pad from which to support its Caribbean colonies and attack Spanish trade.

Spiteful of the Spanish and mindful of the “Black Legend,” the Dutch were determined not to repeat Spanish atrocities. They fashioned guidelines for New Netherlands that conformed to the ideas of Hugo Grotius, a legal philosopher who believed native peoples possessed the same natural rights as Europeans. Colony leaders insisted that land be purchased; in 1626 Peter Minuit therefore “bought” Manhattan from Munsee Indians. Despite the honorable intentions, it is very likely that the Munsee and the Dutch understood their transaction in very different terms. Transactions like these illustrated both the Dutch attempt to find a more peaceful process of colonization and the inconsistency between European and Native American understandings of property.

Like the French, the Dutch sought to profit, not to conquer. Trade with Native peoples became New Netherland’s central economic activity. Dutch traders carried wampum along pre-existing Native trade routes and exchanged it for beaver pelts. Wampum consisted of shell beads fashioned by Algonquian Indians on the southern New England coast, and were valued as a ceremonial and diplomatic commodity among the Iroquois. Wampum became a currency that could buy anything from a loaf of bread to a plot of land.

In addition to developing these trading networks, the Dutch also established farms, settlements, and lumber camps. The West India Company directors implemented the patroon system to encourage colonization. The patroon system granted large estates to wealthy landlords, who subsequently paid passage for the tenants to work their land. Expanding Dutch settlements correlated with deteriorating relations with local Indians. In the interior of the continent the Dutch retained valuable alliances with the Iroquois to maintain Beverwijck, modern-day Albany, as a hub for the fur trade. In the places where the Dutch built permanent settlements, the ideals of peaceful colonization succumbed to the settlers’ increasing demand for land. Armed conflicts erupted as colonial settlements encroached on Native villages and hunting lands. Profit and peace, it seemed, could not coexist.

Labor shortages, meanwhile, crippled Dutch colonization. The patroon system failed to bring enough tenants and the colony could not attract a sufficient number of indentured servants to satisfy the colony’s backers. In response, the colony imported 11 company-owned slaves the same year that Minuit purchased Manhattan. Slaves were tasked with building New Amsterdam (modern-day New York City). They created its roads and maintained its all-important port. Fears of racial mixing led the Dutch to import enslaved women, enabling the formation of African Dutch families. The colony’s first African marriage occurred in 1641, and by 1650 there were at least 500 African slaves in the colony. By 1660 New Amsterdam had the largest urban slave population on the continent.4

As was typical of the practice of African slavery in much of the early seventeenth century, Dutch slavery in New Amsterdam was less comprehensively exploitative than later systems of American slavery. Some enslaved Africans, for instance, successfully sued for back wages. When several company-owned slaves fought for the colony against the Munsee Indians, they petitioned for their freedom and won a kind of “half freedom” that allowed them to work their own land in return for paying a large tithe, or tax, to their masters. The children of this “half-free” laborers were held in bondage by the West India Company, however. The Dutch, who so proudly touted their liberties, grappled with the reality of African slavery, and some New Netherlanders protested the enslavement of Christianized Africans. The economic goals of the colony slowly crowded out these cultural and religious objections, and the much boasted liberties of the Dutch came to exist alongside increasingly brutal systems of slavery.


The Portuguese

The Portuguese had been leaders in Atlantic navigation well ahead of Columbus’s voyage. But the incredible wealth flowing from New Spain piqued the rivalry between the two Iberian countries, and accelerated Portuguese colonization efforts. This rivalry created a crisis within the Catholic world as Spain and Portugal squared off in a battle for colonial supremacy. The Pope intervened and divided the New World with the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. Land east of the Tordesillas Meridian, an imaginary line dividing South America, would be given to Portugal, whereas land west of the line was reserved for Spanish conquest. In return for the license to conquer, both Portugal and Spain were instructed to treat the natives with Christian compassion and to bring them under the protection of the Church.

Lucrative colonies in Africa and India initially preoccupied Portugal, but by 1530 the Portuguese turned their attention to the land that would become Brazil, driving out French traders and establishing permanent settlements. Gold and silver mines dotted the interior of the colony, but two industries powered early colonial Brazil: sugar and the slave trade. In fact, over the entire history of the Atlantic slave trade, more Africans were enslaved in Brazil than any other colony in the Atlantic World. Gold mines emerged in greater number throughout the eighteenth century, but still never rivaled the profitability of sugar or slave-trading.

Jesuit missionaries succeeded in bringing Christianity to Brazil, but strong elements of African and native spirituality mixed with orthodox Catholicism to create a unique religious culture. This culture resulted from the demographics of Brazilian slavery. High mortality rates on sugar plantations required a steady influx of new slaves, thus perpetuating the cultural connection between Brazil and Africa. The reliance on new imports of slaves increased the likelihood of resistance, however, and escaped slaves managed to create several free settlements, called quilombos. These settlements drew from both African and Native slaves, and despite frequent attacks, several endured throughout the long history of Brazilian slavery.

Despite the arrival of these new Europeans, Spain continued to dominate the New World. The wealth flowing from the exploitation of the Aztec and Incan Empires greatly eclipsed the profits of other European nations. But this dominance would not last long. By the end of the sixteenth century, the powerful Spanish Armada would be destroyed, and the English would begin to rule the waves.


**IV. English Colonization**

Spain had a one-hundred year head start on New World colonization and a jealous England eyed the enormous wealth that Spain gleaned from the new World. The Protestant Reformation had shaken England but Elizabeth I assumed the English crown in 1558 and oversaw the expansion of trade and exploration–and the literary achievements of Shakespeare and Marlowe–during England’s so-called “golden age.” English mercantilism, a state-assisted manufacturing and trading system, created and maintained markets, ensured a steady supply of consumers and laborers, stimulated economic expansion, and increased English wealth.

However, wrenching social and economic changes unsettled the English population. The island’s population increased from fewer than three million in 1500 to over five million by the middle of the seventeenth century. The skyrocketing cost of land coincided with plummeting farming income. Rents and prices rose but wages stagnated. Moreover, movements to enclose public land–sparked by the transition of English landholders from agriculture to livestock-raising–evicted tenants from the land and created hordes of landless, jobless peasants that haunted the cities and countryside. One-quarter to one-half of the population lived in extreme poverty.

New World colonization won support in England amid a time of rising English fortunes among the wealthy, a tense Spanish rivalry, and mounting internal social unrest. But English colonization supporters always touted more than economic gains and mere national self-interest. They claimed to be doing God’s work.

Many cited spiritual concerns and argued that colonization would glorify God, England, and Protestantism by Christianizing the New World’s pagan peoples. Advocates such as Richard Hakluyt the Younger and John Dee, for instance, drew upon The History of the Kings of Britain, written by the twelfth century monk Geoffrey of Monmouth, and its mythical account of King Arthur’s conquest and Christianization of pagan lands to justify American conquest. Moreover, promoters promised that the conversion of New World Indians would satisfy God and glorify England’s “Virgin Queen,” Elizabeth I, who was verging on a near-divine image among the English. The English—and other European Protestant colonizers—imagined themselves superior to the Spanish, who still bore the Black Legend of inhuman cruelty. English colonization, supporters argued, would prove that superiority.

In his 1584 “Discourse on Western Planting,” Richard Hakluyt amassed the supposed religious, moral, and exceptional economic benefits of colonization. He repeated the “Black Legend” of Spanish New World terrorism and attacked the sins of Catholic Spain. He promised that English colonization could strike a blow against Spanish heresy and bring Protestant religion to the New World. English interference, Hakluyt suggested, may provide the only salvation from Catholic rule in the New World. The New World, too, he said, offered obvious economic advantages. Trade and resource extraction would enrich the English treasury. England, for instance, could find plentiful materials to outfit a world-class navy. Moreover, he said, the New World could provide an escape for England’s vast armies of landless “vagabonds.” Expanded trade, he argued, would not only bring profit, but also provide work for England’s jobless poor. A Christian enterprise, a blow against Spain, an economic stimulus, and a social safety valve all beckoned the English toward a commitment to colonization.5

This noble rhetoric veiled the coarse economic motives that brought England to the New World. New economic structures and a new merchant class paved the way for colonization. England’s merchants lacked estates but they had new plans to build wealth. By collaborating with new government-sponsored trading monopolies and employing financial innovations such as joint-stock companies, England’s merchants sought to improve on the Dutch economic system. Spain was extracting enormous material wealth from the New World; why shouldn’t England? Joint-stock companies, the ancestors of the modern corporations, became the initial instruments of colonization. With government monopolies, shared profits, and managed risks, these money-making ventures could attract and manage the vast capital needed for colonization. In 1606 James I approved the formation of the Virginia Company (named after Elizabeth, the “Virgin Queen”).

Rather than formal colonization, however, the most successful early English ventures in the New World were a form of state-sponsored piracy known as privateering. Queen Elizabeth sponsored sailors, or “Sea Dogges,” such as John Hawkins and Francis Drake, to plunder Spanish ships and towns in the Americas. Privateers earned a substantial profit both for themselves and for the English crown. England practiced piracy on a scale, one historian wrote, “that transforms crime into politics.”6 Francis Drake harried Spanish ships throughout the Western Hemisphere and raided Spanish caravans as far away as the coast of Peru on the Pacific Ocean. In 1580 Elizabeth rewarded her skilled pirate with knighthood. But Elizabeth walked a fine line. Protestant-Catholic tensions already running high, English privateering provoked Spain. Tensions worsened after the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic. In 1588, King Philip II of Spain unleashed the fabled Armada. With 130 Ships, 8,000 sailors, and 18,000 soldiers, Spain launched the largest invasion in history to destroy the British navy and depose Elizabeth.

An island nation, England depended upon a robust navy for trade and territorial expansion. England had fewer ships than Spain but they were smaller and swifter. They successfully harassed the Armada, forcing it to retreat to the Netherlands for reinforcements. But then a fluke storm, celebrated in England as the “divine wind,” annihilated the remainder of the fleet. The destruction of the Armada changed the course of world history. It not only saved England and secured English Protestantism, but it also opened the seas to English expansion and paved the way for England’s colonial future. By 1600, England stood ready to embark upon its dominance over North America.

English colonization would look very different from Spanish or French colonization, as was indicated by early experiences with the Irish. England had long been trying to conquer Catholic Ireland. The English used a model of forcible segregation with the Irish that would mirror their future relationships with Native Americans. Rather than integrating with the Irish and trying to convert them to Protestantism, England more often simply seized land through violence and pushed out the former inhabitants, leaving them to move elsewhere or to die.

English colonization, however, began haltingly. Sir Humphrey Gilbert labored throughout the late-sixteenth century to establish a colony in New Foundland but failed. In 1587, with a predominantly male cohort of 150 English colonizers, John White reestablished an abandoned settlement on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island. Supply shortages prompted White to return to England for additional support but the Spanish Armada and the mobilization of British naval efforts stranded him in Britain for several years. When he finally returned to Roanoke, he found the colony abandoned. What befell the failed colony? White found the word “Croatan,” the name of a nearby island and Indian people, carved into a tree or a post in the abandoned colony. Historians presume the colonists, short of food, may have fled for the nearby island and its settled native population. Others offer violence as an explanation. Regardless, the English colonists were never heard from again. When Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, no Englishmen had yet established a permanent North American colony.

After King James made peace with Spain in 1604, privateering no longer held out the promise of cheap wealth. Colonization assumed a new urgency. The Virginia Company, established in 1606, drew inspiration from Cortes and the Spanish conquests. It hoped to find gold and silver as well as other valuable trading commodities in the New World: glass, iron, furs, pitch, tar, and anything else the country could supply. The Company planned to identify a navigable river with a deep harbor, away from the eyes of the Spanish. There they would find an Indian trading network and extract a fortune from the New World.


**V. Jamestown**

In April 1607 Englishmen aboard three ships—the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery—sailed forty miles up the James River (named for the English king) in present-day Virginia (Named for Elizabeth I, the “Virgin Queen”) and settled upon just such a place. The uninhabited peninsula they selected was upriver and out of sight of Spanish patrols. It offered easy defense against ground assaults and was uninhabited but still located close enough to many Indian villages and their potentially lucrative trade networks. But the location was a disaster. Indians ignored the peninsula because of its terrible soil and its brackish tidal water that led to debilitating disease. Despite these setbacks, the English built Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in the present-day United States.

The English had not entered a wilderness but had arrived amid a people they called the Powhatan Confederacy. Powhatan, or Wahunsenacawh, as he called himself, led nearly 10,000 Algonquian-speaking Indians in the Chesapeake. They burned vast acreage to clear brush and create sprawling artificial park-like grasslands so that they could easily hunt deer, elk, and bison. The Powhatan raised corn, beans, squash, and possibly sunflowers, rotating acreage throughout the Chesapeake. Without plows, manure, or draft animals, the Powhatan achieved a remarkable number of calories cheaply and efficiently.

Jamestown was a profit-seeking venture backed by investors. The colonists were mostly gentlemen and proved entirely unprepared for the challenges ahead. They hoped for easy riches but found none. The peninsula’s location was poisonous and supplies from England were sporadic or spoiled. As John Smith later complained, they “Would rather starve than work.”7 And so they did. Disease and starvation ravaged the colonists. Fewer than half of the original colonists survived the first nine months.

John Smith, a yeoman’s son and capable leader, took command of the crippled colony and promised, “He that will not work shall not eat.” He navigated Indian diplomacy, claiming that he was captured and sentenced to death but Powhatan’s daughter, Pocahontas, intervened to save his life. She would later marry another colonist, John Rolfe, and die in England.

Powhatan kept the English alive that first winter. The Powhatan had welcomed the English and their manufactured goods. The Powhatan placed a high value on metal axe-heads, kettles, tools, and guns and eagerly traded furs and other abundant goods for them. With 10,000 confederated natives and with food in abundance, the Indians had little to fear and much to gain from the isolated outpost of sick and dying Englishmen.

Despite reinforcements, the English continued to die. Four hundred settlers arrived in 1609 and the overwhelmed colony entered a desperate “starving time” in the winter of 1609-1610. Supplies were lost at sea. Relations with the Indians deteriorated and the colonists fought a kind of slow-burning guerrilla war with the Powhatan. Disaster loomed for the colony. The settlers ate everything they could, roaming the woods for nuts and berries. They boiled leather. They dug up graves to eat the corpses of their former neighbors. One man was executed for killing and eating his wife. Some years later, George Percy recalled the colonists’ desperation during these years, when he served as the colony’s president: “Having fed upon our horses and other beasts as long as they lasted, we were glad to make shift with vermin as dogs, cats, rats and mice … as to eat boots shoes or any other leather … And now famine beginning to look ghastly and pale in every face, that nothing was spared to maintain life and to doe those things which seam incredible, as to dig up dead corpses out of graves and to eat them.”8 Archaeological excavations in 2012 exhumed the bones of a fourteen-year-old girl that exhibited the telltale signs of cannibalism. All but 60 settlers would die by the summer of 1610.

Little improved over the next several years. By 1616, 80 percent of all English immigrants that arrived in Jamestown had perished. England’s first American colony was a catastrophe. The colony was reorganized and in 1614 the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe eased relations with the Powhatan, though the colony still limped along as a starving, commercially disastrous tragedy. The colonists were unable to find any profitable commodities and they still depended upon the Indians and sporadic shipments from England for food. But then tobacco saved Jamestown.

By the time King James I described tobacco as a “noxious weed, … loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs,” it had already taken Europe by storm. In 1616 John Rolfe crossed tobacco strains from Trinidad and Guiana and planted Virginia’s first tobacco crop. In 1617 the colony sent its first cargo of tobacco back to England. The “noxious weed,” a native of the New World, fetched a high price in Europe and the tobacco boom began in Virginia and then later spread to Maryland. Within fifteen years American colonists were exporting over 500,000 pounds of tobacco per year. Within forty, they were exporting fifteen million.

Tobacco changed everything. It saved Virginia from ruin, incentivized further colonization, and laid the groundwork for what would become the United States. With a new market open, Virginia drew not only merchants and traders, but also settlers. Colonists came in droves. They were mostly young, mostly male, and mostly indentured servants, who signed contracts, called indentures that bonded them to employers for a period of years in return for passage across the ocean. But even the rough terms of servitude were no match for the promise of land and potential profits that beckoned ambitious and dispossessed English farmers alike. But still there were not enough of them. Tobacco was a labor-intensive crop and ambitious planters, with seemingly limitless land before them, lacked only laborers to exponentially escalate their wealth and status. The colony’s great labor vacuum inspired the creation of the “headright policy” in 1618: any person who migrated to Virginia would automatically receive 50 acres of land and any immigrant whose passage they paid would entitle them to 50 acres more.

In 1619 the Virginia Company established the House of Burgesses, a limited representative body composed of white landowners that first met in Jamestown. That same year, a Dutch slave ship sold 20 Africans to the Virginia colonists. Southern slavery was born.

Soon the tobacco-growing colonists expanded beyond the bounds of Jamestown’s deadly peninsula. When it became clear that the English were not merely intent on maintaining a small trading post, but sought a permanent ever-expanding colony, conflict with the Powhatan Confederacy became almost inevitable. Powhatan died in 1622 and was succeeded by his brother, Opechancanough, who promised to drive the land-hungry colonists back into the sea. He launched a surprise attack and in a single day (March 22, 1622) killed 347 colonists, or one-fourth of all the colonists in Virginia. The colonists retaliated and revisited the massacres upon Indian settlements many times over. The massacre freed the colonists to drive the Indians off their land. The governor of Virginia declared it colonial policy to achieve the “expulsion of the savages to gain the free range of the country.”9 War and disease destroyed the remnants of the Chesapeake Indians and tilted the balance of power decisively toward the English colonizers, whose foothold in the New World would cease to be as tenuous and challenged.

English colonists brought to the New World particular visions of racial, cultural, and religious supremacy. Despite starving in the shadow of the Powhatan Confederacy, English colonists nevertheless judged themselves physically, spiritually, and technologically superior to native peoples in North America. Christianity, metallurgy, intensive agriculture, trans-Atlantic navigation, and even wheat all magnified the English sense of superiority. This sense of superiority, when coupled with outbreaks of violence, left the English feeling entitled to indigenous lands and resources.

Spanish conquerors established the framework for the Atlantic slave trade over a century before the first chained Africans arrived at Jamestown. Even Bartolomé de las Casas, celebrated for his pleas to save Native Americans from colonial butchery, for a time recommended that indigenous labor be replaced by importing Africans. Early English settlers from the Caribbean and Atlantic coast of North America mostly imitated European ideas of African inferiority. “Race” followed the expansion of slavery across the Atlantic world. Skin-color and race suddenly seemed fixed. Englishmen equated Africans with categorical blackness and blackness with Sin, “the handmaid and symbol of baseness.”10 An English essayist in 1695 wrote that “A negro will always be a negro, carry him to Greenland, feed him chalk, feed and manage him never so many ways.”11 More and more Europeans embraced the notions that Europeans and Africans were of distinct races. Others now preached that the Old Testament God cursed Ham, the son of Noah, and doomed blacks to perpetual enslavement.

And yet in the early years of American slavery, ideas about race were not yet fixed and the practice of slavery was not yet codified. The first generations of Africans in English North America faced miserable conditions but, in contrast to later American history, their initial servitude was not necessarily permanent, heritable, or even particularly disgraceful. Africans were definitively set apart as fundamentally different from their white counterparts, and faced longer terms of service and harsher punishments, but, like the indentured white servants whisked away from English slums, these first Africans in North America could also work for only a set number of years before becoming free landowners themselves. The Angolan Anthony Johnson, for instance, was sold into servitude but fulfilled his indenture and became a prosperous tobacco planter himself.

In 1622, at the dawn of the tobacco boom, Jamestown had still seemed a failure. But the rise of tobacco and the destruction of the Powhatan turned the tide. Colonists escaped the deadly peninsula and immigrants poured into the colony to grow tobacco and turn a profit for the Crown.


**VI. New England**

The English colonies in New England established from 1620 onward were founded with loftier goals than those in Virginia. Although migrants to New England expected economic profit, religious motives directed the rhetoric and much of the reality of these colonies. Not every English person who moved to New England during the seventeenth century was a Puritan, but Puritans dominated the politics, religion, and culture of New England. Even after 1700, the region’s Puritan inheritance shaped many aspects of its history.

The term Puritan began as an insult, and its recipients usually referred to each other as “the godly” if they used a specific term at all. Puritans believed that the Church of England did not distance itself far enough from Catholicism after Henry VIII broke with Rome in the 1530s. They largely agreed with European Calvinists—followers of theologian Jean Calvin—on matters of religious doctrine. Calvinists (and Puritans) believed that mankind was redeemed by God’s Grace alone, and that the fate of an individual’s immortal soul was predestined. The happy minority God had already chosen to save were known among English Puritans as the Elect. Calvinists also argued that the decoration or churches, reliance on ornate ceremony, and (they argued) corrupt priesthood obscured God’s message. They believed that reading the Bible promised the best way to understand God.

Puritans were stereotyped by their enemies as dour killjoys, and the exaggeration has endured. It is certainly true that the Puritans’ disdain for excess and opposition to many holidays popular in Europe (including Christmas, which, as Puritans never tired of reminding everyone, the Bible never told anyone to celebrate) lent themselves to caricature. But Puritans understood themselves as advocating a reasonable middle path in a corrupt world. It would never occur to a Puritan, for example, to abstain from alcohol or sex.

During the first century after the English Reformation (c.1530-1630) Puritans sought to “purify” the Church of England of all practices that smacked of Catholicism, advocating a simpler worship service, the abolition of ornate churches, and other reforms. They had some success in pushing the Church of England in a more Calvinist direction, but with the coronation of King Charles I (r. 1625-1649), the Puritans gained an implacable foe that cast English Puritans as excessive and dangerous. Facing growing persecution, the Puritans began the Great Migration, during which about 20,000 people traveled to New England between 1630 and 1640. The Puritans (unlike the small band of separatist “Pilgrims” who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620) remained committed to reforming the Church of England, but temporarily decamped to North America to accomplish this task. Leaders like John Winthrop insisted they were not separating from, or abandoning, England, but were rather forming a godly community in America, that would be a “Shining City on a Hill” and an example for reformers back home.12 The Puritans did not seek to create a haven of religious toleration, a notion that they—along with nearly all European Christians—regarded as ridiculous at best, and dangerous at worst.

While the Puritans did not succeed in building a godly utopia in New England, a combination of Puritan traits with several external factors created colonies wildly different from any other region settled by English people. Unlike those heading to Virginia, colonists in New England (Plymouth [1620], Massachusetts Bay [1630], Connecticut [1636], and Rhode Island [1636]) generally arrived in family groups. The majority of New England immigrants were small landholders in England, a class contemporary English called the “middling sort.” When they arrived in New England they tended to replicate their home environments, founding towns comprised of independent landholders. The New England climate and soil made large-scale plantation agriculture impractical, so the system of large landholders using masses of slaves or indentured servants to grow labor-intensive crops never took hold.

There is no evidence that the New England Puritans would have opposed such a system were it possible; other Puritans made their fortunes on the Caribbean sugar islands, and New England merchants profited as suppliers of provisions and slaves to those colonies. By accident of geography as much as by design, then, New England society was much less stratified than any of Britain’s other seventeenth-century colonies.

Although New England colonies could boast wealthy landholding elites, the disparity of wealth in the region remained narrow compared to the Chesapeake, Carolina, or the Caribbean. Instead, seventeenth-century New England was characterized by a broadly-shared modest prosperity based on a mixed economy dependent on small farms, shops, fishing, lumber, shipbuilding, and trade with the Atlantic World.

A combination of environmental factors and the Puritan social ethos produced a region of remarkable health and stability during the seventeenth century. New England immigrants avoided most of the deadly outbreaks of tropical disease that turned Chesapeake colonies into graveyards. Disease, in fact, only aided English settlement and relations to Native Americans. In contrast to other English colonists who had to contend with powerful Native American neighbors, the Puritans confronted the stunned survivors of a biological catastrophe. A lethal pandemic of smallpox during the 1610s swept away as much as 90 percent of the region’s Native American population. Many survivors welcomed the English as potential allies against rival tribes who had escaped the catastrophe. The relatively healthy environment coupled with political stability and the predominance of family groups among early immigrants allowed the New England population to grow to 91,000 people by 1700 from only 21,000 immigrants. In contrast, 120,000 English went to the Chesapeake, and only 85,000 white colonists remained in 1700.13

The New England Puritans set out to build their utopia by creating communities of the godly. Groups of men, often from the same region of England, applied to the colony’s General Court for land grants. They generally divided part of the land for immediate use while keeping much of the rest as “commons” or undivided land for future generations. The town’s inhabitants collectively decided the size of each settler’s home lot based on their current wealth and status. Besides oversight of property, the town restricted membership, and new arrivals needed to apply for admission. Those who gained admittance could participate in town governments that, while not democratic by modern standards, nevertheless had broad popular involvement. All male property holders could vote in town meetings and choose the selectmen, assessors, constables, and other officials from among themselves to conduct the daily affairs of government. Upon their founding, towns wrote covenants, reflecting the Puritan belief in God’s covenant with His people. Towns sought to arbitrate disputes and contain strife, as did the church. Wayward or divergent individuals were persuaded and corrected before coercion.

Popular conceptions of Puritans as hardened authoritarians are exaggerated, but if persuasion and arbitration failed, people who did not conform to community norms were punished or removed. Massachusetts banished Anne Hutchinson, Roger Williams, and other religious dissenters like the Quakers.

Although by many measures colonization in New England succeeded, its Puritan leaders failed in their own mission to create a utopian community that would inspire their fellows back in England. They tended to focus their disappointment on the younger generation. “But alas!” Increase Mather lamented, “That so many of the younger Generation have so early corrupted their [the founders’] doings!”14 The Jeremiad, a sermon lamenting the fallen state of New England due to its straying from its early virtuous path, became a staple of late seventeenth-century Puritan literature.

Yet the Jeremiads could not stop the effects of the prosperity that the early Puritans achieved. The population spread and grew more diverse as New England prospered. Many, if not most, New Englanders retained strong ties to their Calvinist roots into the eighteenth century, but the Puritans (who became Congregationalists) struggled against a rising tide of religious pluralism. On December 25, 1727, Judge Samuel Sewell noted in his diary that a new Anglican minister “keeps the day in his new Church at Braintrey: people flock thither.” Previously forbidden holidays like Christmas were not only celebrated in Church. Puritan divine Cotton Mather discovered on the Christmas of 1711, “a number of young people of both sexes, belonging, many of them, to my flock, had…a Frolick, a reveling Feast, and a Ball, which discovers their Corruption.”15

Despite the lamentations of the Mathers and other Puritan leaders of their failure, they left an enduring mark on New England culture and society that endured long after the region’s residents ceased to be called “Puritan.”



**VII. Conclusion**

The fledgling settlements in Virginia and Massachusetts paled in importance when compared to the sugar colonies of the Caribbean. Valued more as marginal investments and social safety valves where the poor could be released, these colonies nonetheless created a foothold for Britain on a vast North American continent. And although the seventeenth century would be fraught for Britain–religious, social, and political upheavals would behead one king and force another to flee his throne–settlers in Massachusetts and Virginia were nonetheless tied together by the emerging Atlantic economy. While commodities such as tobacco and sugar fueled new markets in Europe, the economy grew increasingly dependent upon slave labor. Enslaved Africans transported across the Atlantic would further complicate the collision of cultures in the Americas. The creation and maintenance of a slave system would spark new understandings of human difference and new modes of social control. The economic exchanges of the new Atlantic economy would not only generate great wealth and exploitation, they would also lead to new cultural systems and new identities for the inhabitants of at least four continents.

**I. Introduction**

The Columbian Exchange transformed both sides of the Atlantic, but with dramatically disparate outcomes. New diseases wiped out entire civilizations in the Americas, while newly imported nutrient-rich foodstuffs enabled a European population boom. Spain benefited most immediately as the wealth of the Aztec and Incan Empires strengthened the Spanish monarchy. Spain used its new riches to gain an advantage over other European nations, but this advantage was soon contested.Puritan.”

Portugal, France, the Netherlands, and England all raced to the New World, eager to match the gains of the Spanish. Native peoples greeted the new visitors with responses ranging from welcome cooperation to aggressive violence, but the ravages of disease and the possibility of new trading relationships enabled Europeans to create settlements all along the western rim of the Atlantic world. New empires would emerge from these tenuous beginnings, and by the end of the seventeenth century, Spain would lose its privileged position to its rivals. An age of colonization had begun and, with it, a great collision of cultures commenced.


**II. Spanish America**
Spain extended its reach in the Americas after reaping the benefits of its colonies in Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. Expeditions slowly began combing the continent and bringing Europeans into the modern-day United States in the hopes of establishing religious and economic dominance in a new territory.

Juan Ponce de Leon arrived in the area named “La Florida” in 1513. He found between 150,000 and 300,000 Native Americans. But then two-and-a-half centuries of contact with European and African peoples–whether through war, slave raids, or, most dramtically, foreign disease–decimated Florida’s indigenous population. European explorers, meanwhile, had hoped to find great wealth in Florida, but reality never aligned with their imaginations.

In the first half of the sixteenth century, Spanish colonizers fought frequently with Florida’s native peoples as well as with other Europeans. In the 1560s Spain expelled French Protestants, called Huguenots, from the area near modern-day Jacksonville in northeast Florida. In 1586 English privateer Sir Francis Drake burned the wooden settlement of St. Augustine. At the dawn of the seventeenth century, Spain’s reach in Florida extended from the mouth of the St. Johns River south to the environs of St. Augustine—an area of roughly 1,000 square miles. The Spaniards attempted to duplicate methods for establishing control used previously in Mexico, the Caribbean, and the Andes. The Crown granted missionaries the right to live among Timucua and Guale villagers in the late 1500s and early 1600s and encouraged settlement through the encomienda system (grants of Indian labor).

In the 1630s, the mission system extended into the Apalachee district in the Florida panhandle. The Apalachee, one of the most powerful tribes in Florida at the time of contact, claimed the territory from the modern Florida-Georgia border to the Gulf of Mexico. Apalachee farmers grew an abundance of corn and other crops. Indian traders carried surplus products east along the Camino Real, the royal road that connected the western anchor of the mission system with St. Augustine. Spanish settlers drove cattle eastward across the St. Johns River and established ranches as far west as Apalachee. Still, Spain held Florida tenuously.

Further west, Juan de Oñate led 400 settlers, soldiers, and missionaries from Mexico into New Mexico in 1598. The Spanish Southwest had brutal beginnings. When Oñate sacked the Pueblo city of Acoma, the “sky city,” the Spaniards slaughtered nearly half of its roughly 1,500 inhabitants, including women and children. Oñate ordered one foot cut off of every surviving male over 15 and he enslaved the remaining women and children.1

Santa Fe, the first permanent European settlement in the Southwest, was established in 1610. Few Spaniards relocated to the southwest due to the distance from Mexico City and the dry and hostile environment. Thus, the Spanish never achieved a commanding presence in the region. By 1680, only about 3,000 colonists called Spanish New Mexico home. There, they traded with and exploited the local Puebloan peoples. The region’s Puebloan population had plummeted from as many as 60,000 in 1600 to about 17,000 in 1680.

Spain shifted strategies after the military expeditions wove their way through the southern and western half of North America. Missions became the engine of colonization in North America. Missionaries, most of whom were members of the Franciscan religious order, provided Spain with an advance guard in North America. Catholicism had always justified Spanish conquest, and colonization always carried religious imperatives. By the early seventeenth century, Spanish friars established dozens of missions along the Rio Grande, in New Mexico, and in California.


**III. Spain’s Rivals Emerge**

While Spain plundered the New World, unrest plagued Europe. The Reformation threw England and France, the two European powers capable of contesting Spain, into turmoil. Long and expensive conflicts drained time, resources, and lives. Millions died from religious violence in France alone. As the violence diminished in Europe, however, religious and political rivalries continued in the New World.

The Spanish exploitation of New Spain’s riches inspired European monarchs to invest in exploration and conquest. Reports of Spanish atrocities spread throughout Europe and provided a humanitarian justification for European colonization. An English reprint of the writings of Bartolomé de las Casas bore the sensational title: “Popery Truly Display’d in its Bloody Colours: Or, a Faithful Narrative of the Horrid and Unexampled Massacres, Butcheries, and all manners of Cruelties that Hell and Malice could invent, committed by the Popish Spanish.” An English writer explained that the Indians “were simple and plain men, and lived without great labour,” but in their lust for gold the Spaniards “forced the people (that were not used to labour) to stand all the daie in the hot sun gathering gold in the sand of the rivers. By this means a great nombre of them (not used to such pains) died, and a great number of them (seeing themselves brought from so quiet a life to such misery and slavery) of desperation killed themselves. And many would not marry, because they would not have their children slaves to the Spaniards.”2 The Spanish accused their critics of fostering a “Black Legend.” The Black Legend drew on religious differences and political rivalries. Spain had successful conquests in France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and left many in those nations yearning to break free from Spanish influence. English writers argued that Spanish barbarities were foiling a tremendous opportunity for the expansion of Christianity across the globe and that a benevolent conquest of the New World by non-Spanish monarchies offered the surest salvation of the New World’s pagan masses. With these religious justifications, and with obvious economic motives, Spain’s rivals arrived in the New World.



The French

The French crown subsidized exploration in the early sixteenth century. Early French explorers sought a fabled Northwest Passage, a mythical waterway passing through the North American continent to Asia. Despite the wealth of the New World, Asia’s riches still beckoned to Europeans. Canada’s Saint Lawrence River at first glance appeared to be such a passage, stretching deep into the continent and into the Great Lakes. French colonial possessions centered on these bodies of water (and, later, down the Mississippi River to the port of New Orleans).
French colonization developed through investment from private trading companies. Traders established Port-Royal in Acadia (Nova Scotia) in 1603 and launched trading expeditions that stretched down the Atlantic coast as far as Cape Cod. The needs of the fur trade set the future pattern of French colonization. Founded in 1608 under the leadership of Samuel de Champlain, Quebec provided the foothold for what would become New France. French fur traders placed a higher value on cooperating with the Indians than on establishing a successful French colonial footprint. Asserting dominance in the region could have been to their own detriment, as it may have compromised their access to skilled trappers, and therefore wealth. Few Frenchmen traveled to the New World to settle permanently. In fact, few traveled at all. Many persecuted French Protestants (Huguenots) sought to emigrate after France criminalized Protestantism in 1685, but all non-Catholics were forbidden in New France.

The French preference for trade over permanent settlement fostered more cooperative and mutually beneficial relationships with Native Americans than was typical among the Spanish and English. Perhaps eager to debunk the anti-Catholic elements of the Black Legend, the French worked to cultivate cooperation with Indians. Jesuit missionaries, for instance, adopted different conversion strategies than the Spanish Franciscans. Spanish missionaries brought Indians into enclosed missions, whereas Jesuits more often lived with or alongside Indian groups. Many French fur traders married Indian women. The offspring of Indian women and French men were so common in New France that the French developed a word for these children, Métis(sage). The Huron people developed a particularly close relationship with the French and many converted to Christianity and engaged in the fur trade. But close relationships with the French would come at a high cost. The Huron, for instance, were decimated by the ravages of European disease, and entanglements in French and Dutch conflicts proved disastrous. Despite this, some native peoples maintained distant alliances with the French.

Pressure from the powerful Iroquois in the east pushed many Algonquian-speaking peoples toward French territory in the mid-seventeenth century and together they crafted what historians have called a “middle ground,” where Europeans and natives crafted a kind of cross-cultural space that allowed for native and European interaction, negotiation, and accommodation. French traders adopted–sometimes clumsily–the gift-giving and mediation strategies expected of native leaders and natives engaged the impersonal European market and submitted–often haphazardly–to European laws. The Great Lakes “middle ground” experienced tumultuous success throughout the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries until English colonial officials and American settlers swarmed the region. The pressures of European expansion strained even the closest bonds.3



The Dutch

The Netherlands, a small maritime nation with great wealth, achieved considerable colonial success. In 1581, the Netherlands had officially broken away from the Hapsburgs and won a reputation as the freest of the new European nations. Dutch women maintained separate legal identities from their husbands and could therefore hold property and inherit full estates.

Ravaged by the turmoil of the Reformation, the Dutch embraced greater religious tolerance and freedom of the press than other European nations. Radical Protestants, Catholics, and Jews flocked to the Netherlands. The English Pilgrims, for instance, fled first to Holland before sailing to the New World years later. The Netherlands built its colonial empire through the work of experienced merchants and skilled sailors. The Dutch were the most advanced capitalists in the modern world and marshaled extensive financial resources by creating innovative financial organizations such as the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the East India Company. Although the Dutch offered liberties, they offered very little democracy—power remained in the hands of only a few. And even Dutch liberties had their limits. The Dutch advanced the slave trade and brought African slaves with them to the New World. Slavery was an essential part of Dutch capitalist triumphs.

Sharing the European hunger for access to Asia, in 1609 the Dutch commissioned the Englishman Henry Hudson to discover the fabled Northwest Passage through North America. He failed, of course, but nevertheless found the Hudson River and claimed modern-day New York for the Dutch. There they established New Netherlands, an essential part of the Netherlands’ New World empire. The Netherlands chartered the Dutch West India Company in 1621 and established colonies in Africa, the Caribbean, and North America. The island of Manhattan provided a launching pad from which to support its Caribbean colonies and attack Spanish trade.

Spiteful of the Spanish and mindful of the “Black Legend,” the Dutch were determined not to repeat Spanish atrocities. They fashioned guidelines for New Netherlands that conformed to the ideas of Hugo Grotius, a legal philosopher who believed native peoples possessed the same natural rights as Europeans. Colony leaders insisted that land be purchased; in 1626 Peter Minuit therefore “bought” Manhattan from Munsee Indians. Despite the honorable intentions, it is very likely that the Munsee and the Dutch understood their transaction in very different terms. Transactions like these illustrated both the Dutch attempt to find a more peaceful process of colonization and the inconsistency between European and Native American understandings of property.

Like the French, the Dutch sought to profit, not to conquer. Trade with Native peoples became New Netherland’s central economic activity. Dutch traders carried wampum along pre-existing Native trade routes and exchanged it for beaver pelts. Wampum consisted of shell beads fashioned by Algonquian Indians on the southern New England coast, and were valued as a ceremonial and diplomatic commodity among the Iroquois. Wampum became a currency that could buy anything from a loaf of bread to a plot of land.

In addition to developing these trading networks, the Dutch also established farms, settlements, and lumber camps. The West India Company directors implemented the patroon system to encourage colonization. The patroon system granted large estates to wealthy landlords, who subsequently paid passage for the tenants to work their land. Expanding Dutch settlements correlated with deteriorating relations with local Indians. In the interior of the continent the Dutch retained valuable alliances with the Iroquois to maintain Beverwijck, modern-day Albany, as a hub for the fur trade. In the places where the Dutch built permanent settlements, the ideals of peaceful colonization succumbed to the settlers’ increasing demand for land. Armed conflicts erupted as colonial settlements encroached on Native villages and hunting lands. Profit and peace, it seemed, could not coexist.

Labor shortages, meanwhile, crippled Dutch colonization. The patroon system failed to bring enough tenants and the colony could not attract a sufficient number of indentured servants to satisfy the colony’s backers. In response, the colony imported 11 company-owned slaves the same year that Minuit purchased Manhattan. Slaves were tasked with building New Amsterdam (modern-day New York City). They created its roads and maintained its all-important port. Fears of racial mixing led the Dutch to import enslaved women, enabling the formation of African Dutch families. The colony’s first African marriage occurred in 1641, and by 1650 there were at least 500 African slaves in the colony. By 1660 New Amsterdam had the largest urban slave population on the continent.4

As was typical of the practice of African slavery in much of the early seventeenth century, Dutch slavery in New Amsterdam was less comprehensively exploitative than later systems of American slavery. Some enslaved Africans, for instance, successfully sued for back wages. When several company-owned slaves fought for the colony against the Munsee Indians, they petitioned for their freedom and won a kind of “half freedom” that allowed them to work their own land in return for paying a large tithe, or tax, to their masters. The children of this “half-free” laborers were held in bondage by the West India Company, however. The Dutch, who so proudly touted their liberties, grappled with the reality of African slavery, and some New Netherlanders protested the enslavement of Christianized Africans. The economic goals of the colony slowly crowded out these cultural and religious objections, and the much boasted liberties of the Dutch came to exist alongside increasingly brutal systems of slavery.


The Portuguese

The Portuguese had been leaders in Atlantic navigation well ahead of Columbus’s voyage. But the incredible wealth flowing from New Spain piqued the rivalry between the two Iberian countries, and accelerated Portuguese colonization efforts. This rivalry created a crisis within the Catholic world as Spain and Portugal squared off in a battle for colonial supremacy. The Pope intervened and divided the New World with the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. Land east of the Tordesillas Meridian, an imaginary line dividing South America, would be given to Portugal, whereas land west of the line was reserved for Spanish conquest. In return for the license to conquer, both Portugal and Spain were instructed to treat the natives with Christian compassion and to bring them under the protection of the Church.

Lucrative colonies in Africa and India initially preoccupied Portugal, but by 1530 the Portuguese turned their attention to the land that would become Brazil, driving out French traders and establishing permanent settlements. Gold and silver mines dotted the interior of the colony, but two industries powered early colonial Brazil: sugar and the slave trade. In fact, over the entire history of the Atlantic slave trade, more Africans were enslaved in Brazil than any other colony in the Atlantic World. Gold mines emerged in greater number throughout the eighteenth century, but still never rivaled the profitability of sugar or slave-trading.

Jesuit missionaries succeeded in bringing Christianity to Brazil, but strong elements of African and native spirituality mixed with orthodox Catholicism to create a unique religious culture. This culture resulted from the demographics of Brazilian slavery. High mortality rates on sugar plantations required a steady influx of new slaves, thus perpetuating the cultural connection between Brazil and Africa. The reliance on new imports of slaves increased the likelihood of resistance, however, and escaped slaves managed to create several free settlements, called quilombos. These settlements drew from both African and Native slaves, and despite frequent attacks, several endured throughout the long history of Brazilian slavery.

Despite the arrival of these new Europeans, Spain continued to dominate the New World. The wealth flowing from the exploitation of the Aztec and Incan Empires greatly eclipsed the profits of other European nations. But this dominance would not last long. By the end of the sixteenth century, the powerful Spanish Armada would be destroyed, and the English would begin to rule the waves.


**IV. English Colonization**

Spain had a one-hundred year head start on New World colonization and a jealous England eyed the enormous wealth that Spain gleaned from the new World. The Protestant Reformation had shaken England but Elizabeth I assumed the English crown in 1558 and oversaw the expansion of trade and exploration–and the literary achievements of Shakespeare and Marlowe–during England’s so-called “golden age.” English mercantilism, a state-assisted manufacturing and trading system, created and maintained markets, ensured a steady supply of consumers and laborers, stimulated economic expansion, and increased English wealth.

However, wrenching social and economic changes unsettled the English population. The island’s population increased from fewer than three million in 1500 to over five million by the middle of the seventeenth century. The skyrocketing cost of land coincided with plummeting farming income. Rents and prices rose but wages stagnated. Moreover, movements to enclose public land–sparked by the transition of English landholders from agriculture to livestock-raising–evicted tenants from the land and created hordes of landless, jobless peasants that haunted the cities and countryside. One-quarter to one-half of the population lived in extreme poverty.

New World colonization won support in England amid a time of rising English fortunes among the wealthy, a tense Spanish rivalry, and mounting internal social unrest. But English colonization supporters always touted more than economic gains and mere national self-interest. They claimed to be doing God’s work.

Many cited spiritual concerns and argued that colonization would glorify God, England, and Protestantism by Christianizing the New World’s pagan peoples. Advocates such as Richard Hakluyt the Younger and John Dee, for instance, drew upon The History of the Kings of Britain, written by the twelfth century monk Geoffrey of Monmouth, and its mythical account of King Arthur’s conquest and Christianization of pagan lands to justify American conquest. Moreover, promoters promised that the conversion of New World Indians would satisfy God and glorify England’s “Virgin Queen,” Elizabeth I, who was verging on a near-divine image among the English. The English—and other European Protestant colonizers—imagined themselves superior to the Spanish, who still bore the Black Legend of inhuman cruelty. English colonization, supporters argued, would prove that superiority.

In his 1584 “Discourse on Western Planting,” Richard Hakluyt amassed the supposed religious, moral, and exceptional economic benefits of colonization. He repeated the “Black Legend” of Spanish New World terrorism and attacked the sins of Catholic Spain. He promised that English colonization could strike a blow against Spanish heresy and bring Protestant religion to the New World. English interference, Hakluyt suggested, may provide the only salvation from Catholic rule in the New World. The New World, too, he said, offered obvious economic advantages. Trade and resource extraction would enrich the English treasury. England, for instance, could find plentiful materials to outfit a world-class navy. Moreover, he said, the New World could provide an escape for England’s vast armies of landless “vagabonds.” Expanded trade, he argued, would not only bring profit, but also provide work for England’s jobless poor. A Christian enterprise, a blow against Spain, an economic stimulus, and a social safety valve all beckoned the English toward a commitment to colonization.5

This noble rhetoric veiled the coarse economic motives that brought England to the New World. New economic structures and a new merchant class paved the way for colonization. England’s merchants lacked estates but they had new plans to build wealth. By collaborating with new government-sponsored trading monopolies and employing financial innovations such as joint-stock companies, England’s merchants sought to improve on the Dutch economic system. Spain was extracting enormous material wealth from the New World; why shouldn’t England? Joint-stock companies, the ancestors of the modern corporations, became the initial instruments of colonization. With government monopolies, shared profits, and managed risks, these money-making ventures could attract and manage the vast capital needed for colonization. In 1606 James I approved the formation of the Virginia Company (named after Elizabeth, the “Virgin Queen”).

Rather than formal colonization, however, the most successful early English ventures in the New World were a form of state-sponsored piracy known as privateering. Queen Elizabeth sponsored sailors, or “Sea Dogges,” such as John Hawkins and Francis Drake, to plunder Spanish ships and towns in the Americas. Privateers earned a substantial profit both for themselves and for the English crown. England practiced piracy on a scale, one historian wrote, “that transforms crime into politics.”6 Francis Drake harried Spanish ships throughout the Western Hemisphere and raided Spanish caravans as far away as the coast of Peru on the Pacific Ocean. In 1580 Elizabeth rewarded her skilled pirate with knighthood. But Elizabeth walked a fine line. Protestant-Catholic tensions already running high, English privateering provoked Spain. Tensions worsened after the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic. In 1588, King Philip II of Spain unleashed the fabled Armada. With 130 Ships, 8,000 sailors, and 18,000 soldiers, Spain launched the largest invasion in history to destroy the British navy and depose Elizabeth.

An island nation, England depended upon a robust navy for trade and territorial expansion. England had fewer ships than Spain but they were smaller and swifter. They successfully harassed the Armada, forcing it to retreat to the Netherlands for reinforcements. But then a fluke storm, celebrated in England as the “divine wind,” annihilated the remainder of the fleet. The destruction of the Armada changed the course of world history. It not only saved England and secured English Protestantism, but it also opened the seas to English expansion and paved the way for England’s colonial future. By 1600, England stood ready to embark upon its dominance over North America.

English colonization would look very different from Spanish or French colonization, as was indicated by early experiences with the Irish. England had long been trying to conquer Catholic Ireland. The English used a model of forcible segregation with the Irish that would mirror their future relationships with Native Americans. Rather than integrating with the Irish and trying to convert them to Protestantism, England more often simply seized land through violence and pushed out the former inhabitants, leaving them to move elsewhere or to die.

English colonization, however, began haltingly. Sir Humphrey Gilbert labored throughout the late-sixteenth century to establish a colony in New Foundland but failed. In 1587, with a predominantly male cohort of 150 English colonizers, John White reestablished an abandoned settlement on North Carolina’s Roanoke Island. Supply shortages prompted White to return to England for additional support but the Spanish Armada and the mobilization of British naval efforts stranded him in Britain for several years. When he finally returned to Roanoke, he found the colony abandoned. What befell the failed colony? White found the word “Croatan,” the name of a nearby island and Indian people, carved into a tree or a post in the abandoned colony. Historians presume the colonists, short of food, may have fled for the nearby island and its settled native population. Others offer violence as an explanation. Regardless, the English colonists were never heard from again. When Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, no Englishmen had yet established a permanent North American colony.

After King James made peace with Spain in 1604, privateering no longer held out the promise of cheap wealth. Colonization assumed a new urgency. The Virginia Company, established in 1606, drew inspiration from Cortes and the Spanish conquests. It hoped to find gold and silver as well as other valuable trading commodities in the New World: glass, iron, furs, pitch, tar, and anything else the country could supply. The Company planned to identify a navigable river with a deep harbor, away from the eyes of the Spanish. There they would find an Indian trading network and extract a fortune from the New World.


**V. Jamestown**

In April 1607 Englishmen aboard three ships—the Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery—sailed forty miles up the James River (named for the English king) in present-day Virginia (Named for Elizabeth I, the “Virgin Queen”) and settled upon just such a place. The uninhabited peninsula they selected was upriver and out of sight of Spanish patrols. It offered easy defense against ground assaults and was uninhabited but still located close enough to many Indian villages and their potentially lucrative trade networks. But the location was a disaster. Indians ignored the peninsula because of its terrible soil and its brackish tidal water that led to debilitating disease. Despite these setbacks, the English built Jamestown, the first permanent English colony in the present-day United States.

The English had not entered a wilderness but had arrived amid a people they called the Powhatan Confederacy. Powhatan, or Wahunsenacawh, as he called himself, led nearly 10,000 Algonquian-speaking Indians in the Chesapeake. They burned vast acreage to clear brush and create sprawling artificial park-like grasslands so that they could easily hunt deer, elk, and bison. The Powhatan raised corn, beans, squash, and possibly sunflowers, rotating acreage throughout the Chesapeake. Without plows, manure, or draft animals, the Powhatan achieved a remarkable number of calories cheaply and efficiently.

Jamestown was a profit-seeking venture backed by investors. The colonists were mostly gentlemen and proved entirely unprepared for the challenges ahead. They hoped for easy riches but found none. The peninsula’s location was poisonous and supplies from England were sporadic or spoiled. As John Smith later complained, they “Would rather starve than work.”7 And so they did. Disease and starvation ravaged the colonists. Fewer than half of the original colonists survived the first nine months.

John Smith, a yeoman’s son and capable leader, took command of the crippled colony and promised, “He that will not work shall not eat.” He navigated Indian diplomacy, claiming that he was captured and sentenced to death but Powhatan’s daughter, Pocahontas, intervened to save his life. She would later marry another colonist, John Rolfe, and die in England.

Powhatan kept the English alive that first winter. The Powhatan had welcomed the English and their manufactured goods. The Powhatan placed a high value on metal axe-heads, kettles, tools, and guns and eagerly traded furs and other abundant goods for them. With 10,000 confederated natives and with food in abundance, the Indians had little to fear and much to gain from the isolated outpost of sick and dying Englishmen.

Despite reinforcements, the English continued to die. Four hundred settlers arrived in 1609 and the overwhelmed colony entered a desperate “starving time” in the winter of 1609-1610. Supplies were lost at sea. Relations with the Indians deteriorated and the colonists fought a kind of slow-burning guerrilla war with the Powhatan. Disaster loomed for the colony. The settlers ate everything they could, roaming the woods for nuts and berries. They boiled leather. They dug up graves to eat the corpses of their former neighbors. One man was executed for killing and eating his wife. Some years later, George Percy recalled the colonists’ desperation during these years, when he served as the colony’s president: “Having fed upon our horses and other beasts as long as they lasted, we were glad to make shift with vermin as dogs, cats, rats and mice … as to eat boots shoes or any other leather … And now famine beginning to look ghastly and pale in every face, that nothing was spared to maintain life and to doe those things which seam incredible, as to dig up dead corpses out of graves and to eat them.”8 Archaeological excavations in 2012 exhumed the bones of a fourteen-year-old girl that exhibited the telltale signs of cannibalism. All but 60 settlers would die by the summer of 1610.

Little improved over the next several years. By 1616, 80 percent of all English immigrants that arrived in Jamestown had perished. England’s first American colony was a catastrophe. The colony was reorganized and in 1614 the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe eased relations with the Powhatan, though the colony still limped along as a starving, commercially disastrous tragedy. The colonists were unable to find any profitable commodities and they still depended upon the Indians and sporadic shipments from England for food. But then tobacco saved Jamestown.

By the time King James I described tobacco as a “noxious weed, … loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, and dangerous to the lungs,” it had already taken Europe by storm. In 1616 John Rolfe crossed tobacco strains from Trinidad and Guiana and planted Virginia’s first tobacco crop. In 1617 the colony sent its first cargo of tobacco back to England. The “noxious weed,” a native of the New World, fetched a high price in Europe and the tobacco boom began in Virginia and then later spread to Maryland. Within fifteen years American colonists were exporting over 500,000 pounds of tobacco per year. Within forty, they were exporting fifteen million.

Tobacco changed everything. It saved Virginia from ruin, incentivized further colonization, and laid the groundwork for what would become the United States. With a new market open, Virginia drew not only merchants and traders, but also settlers. Colonists came in droves. They were mostly young, mostly male, and mostly indentured servants, who signed contracts, called indentures that bonded them to employers for a period of years in return for passage across the ocean. But even the rough terms of servitude were no match for the promise of land and potential profits that beckoned ambitious and dispossessed English farmers alike. But still there were not enough of them. Tobacco was a labor-intensive crop and ambitious planters, with seemingly limitless land before them, lacked only laborers to exponentially escalate their wealth and status. The colony’s great labor vacuum inspired the creation of the “headright policy” in 1618: any person who migrated to Virginia would automatically receive 50 acres of land and any immigrant whose passage they paid would entitle them to 50 acres more.

In 1619 the Virginia Company established the House of Burgesses, a limited representative body composed of white landowners that first met in Jamestown. That same year, a Dutch slave ship sold 20 Africans to the Virginia colonists. Southern slavery was born.

Soon the tobacco-growing colonists expanded beyond the bounds of Jamestown’s deadly peninsula. When it became clear that the English were not merely intent on maintaining a small trading post, but sought a permanent ever-expanding colony, conflict with the Powhatan Confederacy became almost inevitable. Powhatan died in 1622 and was succeeded by his brother, Opechancanough, who promised to drive the land-hungry colonists back into the sea. He launched a surprise attack and in a single day (March 22, 1622) killed 347 colonists, or one-fourth of all the colonists in Virginia. The colonists retaliated and revisited the massacres upon Indian settlements many times over. The massacre freed the colonists to drive the Indians off their land. The governor of Virginia declared it colonial policy to achieve the “expulsion of the savages to gain the free range of the country.”9 War and disease destroyed the remnants of the Chesapeake Indians and tilted the balance of power decisively toward the English colonizers, whose foothold in the New World would cease to be as tenuous and challenged.

English colonists brought to the New World particular visions of racial, cultural, and religious supremacy. Despite starving in the shadow of the Powhatan Confederacy, English colonists nevertheless judged themselves physically, spiritually, and technologically superior to native peoples in North America. Christianity, metallurgy, intensive agriculture, trans-Atlantic navigation, and even wheat all magnified the English sense of superiority. This sense of superiority, when coupled with outbreaks of violence, left the English feeling entitled to indigenous lands and resources.

Spanish conquerors established the framework for the Atlantic slave trade over a century before the first chained Africans arrived at Jamestown. Even Bartolomé de las Casas, celebrated for his pleas to save Native Americans from colonial butchery, for a time recommended that indigenous labor be replaced by importing Africans. Early English settlers from the Caribbean and Atlantic coast of North America mostly imitated European ideas of African inferiority. “Race” followed the expansion of slavery across the Atlantic world. Skin-color and race suddenly seemed fixed. Englishmen equated Africans with categorical blackness and blackness with Sin, “the handmaid and symbol of baseness.”10 An English essayist in 1695 wrote that “A negro will always be a negro, carry him to Greenland, feed him chalk, feed and manage him never so many ways.”11 More and more Europeans embraced the notions that Europeans and Africans were of distinct races. Others now preached that the Old Testament God cursed Ham, the son of Noah, and doomed blacks to perpetual enslavement.

And yet in the early years of American slavery, ideas about race were not yet fixed and the practice of slavery was not yet codified. The first generations of Africans in English North America faced miserable conditions but, in contrast to later American history, their initial servitude was not necessarily permanent, heritable, or even particularly disgraceful. Africans were definitively set apart as fundamentally different from their white counterparts, and faced longer terms of service and harsher punishments, but, like the indentured white servants whisked away from English slums, these first Africans in North America could also work for only a set number of years before becoming free landowners themselves. The Angolan Anthony Johnson, for instance, was sold into servitude but fulfilled his indenture and became a prosperous tobacco planter himself.

In 1622, at the dawn of the tobacco boom, Jamestown had still seemed a failure. But the rise of tobacco and the destruction of the Powhatan turned the tide. Colonists escaped the deadly peninsula and immigrants poured into the colony to grow tobacco and turn a profit for the Crown.


**VI. New England**

The English colonies in New England established from 1620 onward were founded with loftier goals than those in Virginia. Although migrants to New England expected economic profit, religious motives directed the rhetoric and much of the reality of these colonies. Not every English person who moved to New England during the seventeenth century was a Puritan, but Puritans dominated the politics, religion, and culture of New England. Even after 1700, the region’s Puritan inheritance shaped many aspects of its history.

The term Puritan began as an insult, and its recipients usually referred to each other as “the godly” if they used a specific term at all. Puritans believed that the Church of England did not distance itself far enough from Catholicism after Henry VIII broke with Rome in the 1530s. They largely agreed with European Calvinists—followers of theologian Jean Calvin—on matters of religious doctrine. Calvinists (and Puritans) believed that mankind was redeemed by God’s Grace alone, and that the fate of an individual’s immortal soul was predestined. The happy minority God had already chosen to save were known among English Puritans as the Elect. Calvinists also argued that the decoration or churches, reliance on ornate ceremony, and (they argued) corrupt priesthood obscured God’s message. They believed that reading the Bible promised the best way to understand God.

Puritans were stereotyped by their enemies as dour killjoys, and the exaggeration has endured. It is certainly true that the Puritans’ disdain for excess and opposition to many holidays popular in Europe (including Christmas, which, as Puritans never tired of reminding everyone, the Bible never told anyone to celebrate) lent themselves to caricature. But Puritans understood themselves as advocating a reasonable middle path in a corrupt world. It would never occur to a Puritan, for example, to abstain from alcohol or sex.

During the first century after the English Reformation (c.1530-1630) Puritans sought to “purify” the Church of England of all practices that smacked of Catholicism, advocating a simpler worship service, the abolition of ornate churches, and other reforms. They had some success in pushing the Church of England in a more Calvinist direction, but with the coronation of King Charles I (r. 1625-1649), the Puritans gained an implacable foe that cast English Puritans as excessive and dangerous. Facing growing persecution, the Puritans began the Great Migration, during which about 20,000 people traveled to New England between 1630 and 1640. The Puritans (unlike the small band of separatist “Pilgrims” who founded Plymouth Colony in 1620) remained committed to reforming the Church of England, but temporarily decamped to North America to accomplish this task. Leaders like John Winthrop insisted they were not separating from, or abandoning, England, but were rather forming a godly community in America, that would be a “Shining City on a Hill” and an example for reformers back home.12 The Puritans did not seek to create a haven of religious toleration, a notion that they—along with nearly all European Christians—regarded as ridiculous at best, and dangerous at worst.

While the Puritans did not succeed in building a godly utopia in New England, a combination of Puritan traits with several external factors created colonies wildly different from any other region settled by English people. Unlike those heading to Virginia, colonists in New England (Plymouth [1620], Massachusetts Bay [1630], Connecticut [1636], and Rhode Island [1636]) generally arrived in family groups. The majority of New England immigrants were small landholders in England, a class contemporary English called the “middling sort.” When they arrived in New England they tended to replicate their home environments, founding towns comprised of independent landholders. The New England climate and soil made large-scale plantation agriculture impractical, so the system of large landholders using masses of slaves or indentured servants to grow labor-intensive crops never took hold.

There is no evidence that the New England Puritans would have opposed such a system were it possible; other Puritans made their fortunes on the Caribbean sugar islands, and New England merchants profited as suppliers of provisions and slaves to those colonies. By accident of geography as much as by design, then, New England society was much less stratified than any of Britain’s other seventeenth-century colonies.

Although New England colonies could boast wealthy landholding elites, the disparity of wealth in the region remained narrow compared to the Chesapeake, Carolina, or the Caribbean. Instead, seventeenth-century New England was characterized by a broadly-shared modest prosperity based on a mixed economy dependent on small farms, shops, fishing, lumber, shipbuilding, and trade with the Atlantic World.

A combination of environmental factors and the Puritan social ethos produced a region of remarkable health and stability during the seventeenth century. New England immigrants avoided most of the deadly outbreaks of tropical disease that turned Chesapeake colonies into graveyards. Disease, in fact, only aided English settlement and relations to Native Americans. In contrast to other English colonists who had to contend with powerful Native American neighbors, the Puritans confronted the stunned survivors of a biological catastrophe. A lethal pandemic of smallpox during the 1610s swept away as much as 90 percent of the region’s Native American population. Many survivors welcomed the English as potential allies against rival tribes who had escaped the catastrophe. The relatively healthy environment coupled with political stability and the predominance of family groups among early immigrants allowed the New England population to grow to 91,000 people by 1700 from only 21,000 immigrants. In contrast, 120,000 English went to the Chesapeake, and only 85,000 white colonists remained in 1700.13

The New England Puritans set out to build their utopia by creating communities of the godly. Groups of men, often from the same region of England, applied to the colony’s General Court for land grants. They generally divided part of the land for immediate use while keeping much of the rest as “commons” or undivided land for future generations. The town’s inhabitants collectively decided the size of each settler’s home lot based on their current wealth and status. Besides oversight of property, the town restricted membership, and new arrivals needed to apply for admission. Those who gained admittance could participate in town governments that, while not democratic by modern standards, nevertheless had broad popular involvement. All male property holders could vote in town meetings and choose the selectmen, assessors, constables, and other officials from among themselves to conduct the daily affairs of government. Upon their founding, towns wrote covenants, reflecting the Puritan belief in God’s covenant with His people. Towns sought to arbitrate disputes and contain strife, as did the church. Wayward or divergent individuals were persuaded and corrected before coercion.

Popular conceptions of Puritans as hardened authoritarians are exaggerated, but if persuasion and arbitration failed, people who did not conform to community norms were punished or removed. Massachusetts banished Anne Hutchinson, Roger Williams, and other religious dissenters like the Quakers.

Although by many measures colonization in New England succeeded, its Puritan leaders failed in their own mission to create a utopian community that would inspire their fellows back in England. They tended to focus their disappointment on the younger generation. “But alas!” Increase Mather lamented, “That so many of the younger Generation have so early corrupted their [the founders’] doings!”14 The Jeremiad, a sermon lamenting the fallen state of New England due to its straying from its early virtuous path, became a staple of late seventeenth-century Puritan literature.

Yet the Jeremiads could not stop the effects of the prosperity that the early Puritans achieved. The population spread and grew more diverse as New England prospered. Many, if not most, New Englanders retained strong ties to their Calvinist roots into the eighteenth century, but the Puritans (who became Congregationalists) struggled against a rising tide of religious pluralism. On December 25, 1727, Judge Samuel Sewell noted in his diary that a new Anglican minister “keeps the day in his new Church at Braintrey: people flock thither.” Previously forbidden holidays like Christmas were not only celebrated in Church. Puritan divine Cotton Mather discovered on the Christmas of 1711, “a number of young people of both sexes, belonging, many of them, to my flock, had…a Frolick, a reveling Feast, and a Ball, which discovers their Corruption.”15

Despite the lamentations of the Mathers and other Puritan leaders of their failure, they left an enduring mark on New England culture and society that endured long after the region’s residents ceased to be called “Puritan.”



**VII. Conclusion**

The fledgling settlements in Virginia and Massachusetts paled in importance when compared to the sugar colonies of the Caribbean. Valued more as marginal investments and social safety valves where the poor could be released, these colonies nonetheless created a foothold for Britain on a vast North American continent. And although the seventeenth century would be fraught for Britain–religious, social, and political upheavals would behead one king and force another to flee his throne–settlers in Massachusetts and Virginia were nonetheless tied together by the emerging Atlantic economy. While commodities such as tobacco and sugar fueled new markets in Europe, the economy grew increasingly dependent upon slave labor. Enslaved Africans transported across the Atlantic would further complicate the collision of cultures in the Americas. The creation and maintenance of a slave system would spark new understandings of human difference and new modes of social control. The economic exchanges of the new Atlantic economy would not only generate great wealth and exploitation, they would also lead to new cultural systems and new identities for the inhabitants of at least four continents.

Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he on conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.

I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp Angel's, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and gave me good day. I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley--Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time resident of Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.

Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in 'finesse.' I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.

""Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here, once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit him any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'

""Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards' start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of the race she get excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.

""And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.
""Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.

""Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller --a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:

""'What might it be that you've got in the box?'

""And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, 'It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.'

""And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, 'H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's HE good for.

""'Well,' Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough for one thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.

""The feller took the box again, and took another long, partiular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'

""'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says. 'Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'

""And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, 'Well, I'm only a, stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you.

""And then Smiley says, 'That's all right--that's all right if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.' Any so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.

""So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail-shot-filled him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller and says:

""'Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore paws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.' Then he says, 'One-two- three--git' and him and the feller touches up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders---so-like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was of course.

""The Teller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'
""Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him --he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.' And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, 'Why blame my cats if he don't weigh five pound!' and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man --he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And--""

[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: ""Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be gone a second.""

But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away.

At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:

""Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and--""

However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.1Embed"

The horn sounded at daybreak, as Silas Foster had forewarned us, harsh, uproarious, inexorably drawn out, and as sleep-dispelling as if this hard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom.

On all sides I could hear the creaking of the bedsteads, as the brethren of Blithedale started from slumber, and thrust themselves into their habiliments, all awry, no doubt, in their haste to begin the reformation of the world. Zenobia put her head into the entry, and besought Silas Foster to cease his clamor, and to be kind enough to leave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door. Of the whole household,—unless, indeed, it were Priscilla, for whose habits, in this particular, I cannot vouch,—of all our apostolic society, whose mission was to bless mankind, Hollingsworth, I apprehend, was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer. My sleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his, the solemn murmur of his voice made its way to my ears, compelling me to be an auditor of his awful privacy with the Creator. It affected me with a deep reverence for Hollingsworth, which no familiarity then existing, or that afterwards grew more intimate between us,—no, nor my subsequent perception of his own great errors,—ever quite effaced. It is so rare, in these times, to meet with a man of prayerful habits (except, of course, in the pulpit), that such an one is decidedly marked out by the light of transfiguration, shed upon him in the divine interview from which he passes into his daily life.

As for me, I lay abed; and if I said my prayers, it was backward, cursing my day as bitterly as patient Job himself. The truth was, the hot-house warmth of a town residence, and the luxurious life in which I indulged myself, had taken much of the pith out of my physical system; and the wintry blast of the preceding day, together with the general chill of our airy old farmhouse, had got fairly into my heart and the marrow of my bones. In this predicament, I seriously wished—selfish as it may appear—that the reformation of society had been postponed about half a century, or, at all events, to such a date as should have put my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question.

What, in the name of common-sense, had I to do with any better society than I had always lived in? It had satisfied me well enough. My pleasant bachelor-parlor, sunny and shadowy, curtained and carpeted, with the bedchamber adjoining; my centre-table, strewn with books and periodicals; my writing-desk with a half-finished poem, in a stanza of my own contrivance; my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture gallery; my noontide walk along the cheery pavement, with the suggestive succession of human faces, and the brisk throb of human life in which I shared; my dinner at the Albion, where I had a hundred dishes at command, and could banquet as delicately as the wizard Michael Scott when the Devil fed him from the king of France's kitchen; my evening at the billiard club, the concert, the theatre, or at somebody's party, if I pleased,—what could be better than all this? Was it better to hoe, to mow, to toil and moil amidst the accumulations of a barnyard; to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen cows; to eat salt beef, and earn it with the sweat of my brow, and thereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth, into whose vocation I had thrust myself? Above all, was it better to have a fever and die blaspheming, as I was like to do?

In this wretched plight, with a furnace in my heart and another in my head, by the heat of which I was kept constantly at the boiling point, yet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into the icy atmosphere of the room, I kept my bed until breakfast-time, when Hollingsworth knocked at the door, and entered.
""Well, Coverdale,"" cried he, ""you bid fair to make an admirable farmer! Don't you mean to get up to-day?""

""Neither to-day nor to-morrow,"" said I hopelessly. ""I doubt if I ever rise again!""

""What is the matter now?"" he asked.

I told him my piteous case, and besought him to send me back to town in a close carriage.

""No, no!"" said Hollingsworth with kindly seriousness. ""If you are really sick, we must take care of you.""

Accordingly he built a fire in my chamber, and, having little else to do while the snow lay on the ground, established himself as my nurse. A doctor was sent for, who, being homaeopathic, gave me as much medicine, in the course of a fortnight's attendance, as would have laid on the point of a needle. They fed me on water-gruel, and I speedily became a skeleton above ground. But, after all, I have many precious recollections connected with that fit of sickness.

Hollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible comfort. Most men—and certainly I could not always claim to be one of the exceptions—have a natural indifference, if not an absolutely hostile feeling, towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our selfish existence. The education of Christianity, it is true, the sympathy of a like experience and the example of women, may soften and, possibly, subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex; but it is originally there, and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our brute brethren, who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from among them, as an enemy. It is for this reason that the stricken deer goes apart, and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den. Except in love, or the attachments of kindred, or other very long and habitual affection, we really have no tenderness. But there was something of the woman moulded into the great, stalwart frame of Hollingsworth; nor was he ashamed of it, as men often are of what is best in them, nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place in his heart. I knew it well, however, at that time, although afterwards it came nigh to be forgotten. Methought there could not be two such men alive as Hollingsworth. There never was any blaze of a fireside that warmed and cheered me, in the down-sinkings and shiverings of my spirit, so effectually as did the light out of those eyes, which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows.

Happy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die! and unless a friend like Hollingsworth be at hand,—as most probably there will not,—he had better make up his mind to die alone. How many men, I wonder, does one meet with in a lifetime, whom he would choose for his deathbed companions! At the crisis of my fever I besought Hollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room, but continually to make me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand, a word, a prayer, if he thought good to utter it; and that then he should be the witness how courageously I would encounter the worst. It still impresses me as almost a matter of regret that I did not die then, when I had tolerably made up my mind to it; for Hollingsworth would have gone with me to the hither verge of life, and have sent his friendly and hopeful accents far over on the other side, while I should be treading the unknown path. Now, were I to send for him, he would hardly come to my bedside, nor should I depart the easier for his presence.

""You are not going to die, this time,"" said he, gravely smiling. ""You know nothing about sickness, and think your case a great deal more desperate than it is.""

""Death should take me while I am in the mood,"" replied I, with a little of my customary levity.

""Have you nothing to do in life,"" asked Hollingsworth, ""that you fancy yourself so ready to leave it?""

""Nothing,"" answered I; ""nothing that I know of, unless to make pretty verses, and play a part, with Zenobia and the rest of the amateurs, in our pastoral. It seems but an unsubstantial sort of business, as viewed through a mist of fever. But, dear Hollingsworth, your own vocation is evidently to be a priest, and to spend your days and nights in helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths.""

""And by which of my qualities,"" inquired he, ""can you suppose me fitted for this awful ministry?""
""By your tenderness,"" I said. ""It seems to me the reflection of God's own love.""

""And you call me tender!"" repeated Hollingsworth thoughtfully. ""I should rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an inflexible severity of purpose. Mortal man has no right to be so inflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be.""

""I do not believe it,"" I replied.

But, in due time, I remembered what he said.

Probably, as Hollingsworth suggested, my disorder was never so serious as, in my ignorance of such matters, I was inclined to consider it. After so much tragical preparation, it was positively rather mortifying to find myself on the mending hand.

All the other members of the Community showed me kindness, according to the full measure of their capacity. Zenobia brought me my gruel every day, made by her own hands (not very skilfully, if the truth must be told), and, whenever I seemed inclined to converse, would sit by my bedside, and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous throbs to my pulse. Her poor little stories and tracts never half did justice to her intellect. It was only the lack of a fitter avenue that drove her to seek development in literature. She was made (among a thousand other things that she might have been) for a stump oratress. I recognized no severe culture in Zenobia; her mind was full of weeds. It startled me sometimes, in my state of moral as well as bodily faint-heartedness, to observe the hardihood of her philosophy. She made no scruple of oversetting all human institutions, and scattering them as with a breeze from her fan. A female reformer, in her attacks upon society, has an instinctive sense of where the life lies, and is inclined to aim directly at that spot. Especially the relation between the sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice.

Zenobia was truly a magnificent woman. The homely simplicity of her dress could not conceal, nor scarcely diminish, the queenliness of her presence. The image of her form and face should have been multiplied all over the earth. It was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her as the spectacle of only a few. The stage would have been her proper sphere. She should have made it a point of duty, moreover, to sit endlessly to painters and sculptors, and preferably to the latter; because the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost scantiness of drapery, so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with her material perfection in its entireness. I know not well how to express that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks, and even the flesh-warmth over her round arms, and what was visible of her full bust,—in a word, her womanliness incarnated,—compelled me sometimes to close my eyes, as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to gaze at her. Illness and exhaustion, no doubt, had made me morbidly sensitive.

I noticed—and wondered how Zenobia contrived it—that she had always a new flower in her hair. And still it was a hot-house flower,—an outlandish flower,—a flower of the tropics, such as appeared to have sprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be fervid and spicy. Unlike as was the flower of each successive day to the preceding one, it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich beauty of the woman, that I thought it the only flower fit to be worn; so fit, indeed, that Nature had evidently created this floral gem, in a happy exuberance, for the one purpose of worthily adorning Zenobia's head. It might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves about this peculiarity, and caused it to look more gorgeous and wonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes. In the height of my illness, as I well recollect, I went so far as to pronounce it preternatural.

""Zenobia is an enchantress!"" whispered I once to Hollingsworth. ""She is a sister of the Veiled Lady. That flower in her hair is a talisman. If you were to snatch it away, she would vanish, or be transformed into something else.""

""What does he say?"" asked Zenobia.

""Nothing that has an atom of sense in it,"" answered Hollingsworth. ""He is a little beside himself, I believe, and talks about your being a witch, and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your hair.""

""It is an idea worthy of a feverish poet,"" said she, laughing rather compassionately, and taking out the flower. ""I scorn to owe anything to magic. Here, Mr. Hollingsworth, you may keep the spell while it has any virtue in it; but I cannot promise you not to appear with a new one to-morrow. It is the one relic of my more brilliant, my happier days!""

The most curious part of the matter was that, long after my slight delirium had passed away,—as long, indeed, as I continued to know this remarkable woman,—her daily flower affected my imagination, though more slightly, yet in very much the same way. The reason must have been that, whether intentionally on her part or not, this favorite ornament was actually a subtile expression of Zenobia's character.
One subject, about which—very impertinently, moreover—I perplexed myself with a great many conjectures, was, whether Zenobia had ever been married. The idea, it must be understood, was unauthorized by any circumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears. So young as I beheld her, and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand, there was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already accomplished; the probability was far greater that her coming years had all life's richest gifts to bring. If the great event of a woman's existence had been consummated, the world knew nothing of it, although the world seemed to know Zenobia well. It was a ridiculous piece of romance, undoubtedly, to imagine that this beautiful personage, wealthy as she was, and holding a position that might fairly enough be called distinguished, could have given herself away so privately, but that some whisper and suspicion, and by degrees a full understanding of the fact, would eventually be blown abroad. But then, as I failed not to consider, her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles. Rumors might fill the social atmosphere, or might once have filled it, there, which would travel but slowly, against the wind, towards our Northeastern metropolis, and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching it.

There was not—and I distinctly repeat it—the slightest foundation in my knowledge for any surmise of the kind. But there is a species of intuition,—either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a fact,—which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system. The soul gets the better of the body, after wasting illness, or when a vegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood. Vapors then rise up to the brain, and take shapes that often image falsehood, but sometimes truth. The spheres of our companions have, at such periods, a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust health gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy. Zenobia's sphere, I imagine, impressed itself powerfully on mine, and transformed me, during this period of my weakness, into something like a mesmerical clairvoyant.

Then, also, as anybody could observe, the freedom of her deportment (though, to some tastes, it might commend itself as the utmost perfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron) was not exactly maiden-like. What girl had ever laughed as Zenobia did? What girl had ever spoken in her mellow tones? Her unconstrained and inevitable manifestation, I said often to myself, was that of a woman to whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery. Yet sometimes I strove to be ashamed of these conjectures. I acknowledged it as a masculine grossness—a sin of wicked interpretation, of which man is often guilty towards the other sex—thus to mistake the sweet, liberal, but womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition. Still, it was of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself. Pertinaciously the thought, ""Zenobia is a wife; Zenobia has lived and loved! There is no folded petal, no latent dewdrop, in this perfectly developed rose!""—irresistibly that thought drove out all other conclusions, as often as my mind reverted to the subject.

Zenobia was conscious of my observation, though not, I presume, of the point to which it led me.

""Mr. Coverdale,"" said she one day, as she saw me watching her, while she arranged my gruel on the table, ""I have been exposed to a great deal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world, but never, I think, to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring me with. I seem to interest you very much; and yet—or else a woman's instinct is for once deceived—I cannot reckon you as an admirer. What are you seeking to discover in me?""

""The mystery of your life,"" answered I, surprised into the truth by the unexpectedness of her attack. ""And you will never tell me.""

She bent her head towards me, and let me look into her eyes, as if challenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her consciousness.

""I see nothing now,"" said I, closing my own eyes, ""unless it be the face of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well.""

A bachelor always feels himself defrauded, when he knows or suspects that any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away. Otherwise, the matter could have been no concern of mine. It was purely speculative, for I should not, under any circumstances, have fallen in love with Zenobia. The riddle made me so nervous, however, in my sensitive condition of mind and body, that I most ungratefully began to wish that she would let me alone. Then, too, her gruel was very wretched stuff, with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it, like the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best concocted dainties. Why could not she have allowed one of the other women to take the gruel in charge? Whatever else might be her gifts, Nature certainly never intended Zenobia for a cook. Or, if so, she should have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes, and such as are to be tasted at banquets, between draughts of intoxicating wine.Embed"

A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.



Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.



The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.


McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?



Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.

McGonagall: And the boy?

Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

Albus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.



There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.



Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.



Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.



McGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are.

Dumbledore: The only family he has.



They stop outside a house.



McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.



Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.


Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.



Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.



Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.



The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:

HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE


Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.



Petunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}



A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.



Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!



Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.



Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.



Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!



A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.



Vernon: Happy birthday, son.



Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.



Petunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.

Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.



He sets to work.



Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.

Vernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!

Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.



Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.



Dudley: How many are there?

Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.

Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!

Vernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!

Dudley: I don't care how big they are!

Petunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?



Scene:

Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.



Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.

Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.



Scene:

The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.



Dudley: Make it move.

Vernon raps the glass of the cage.



Vernon: Move!



Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.



Dudley: MOVE!

Harry: He's asleep!

Dudley: He's boring.



Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.



Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.



The snake looks up and blinks.



Harry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.



The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.



Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!



Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.



Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!



Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.



Snake: Thankssssssss.

Harry: Anytime.



The snake starts off.



Man: SNAKE!



There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.



Dudley: Mum, mummy!

Petunia: {Sees him} AHH!

Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!

Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!

Harry: {Grins and giggles}



Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!



Scene:

Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.

Petunia: It's all right. It's all right.



They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.



Harry: Ow!

Vernon: What happened?

Harry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Vernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!



Scene:

Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.

Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.



Vernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

Dudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!

Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!

Vernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?



The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.



Scene:

Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.

In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.



Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.



Scene:

Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.



Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.



She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.



Vernon: Shoo! Go on!



Scene:

Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.



Scene:

Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.



Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?



Dudley shrugs.



Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---



A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.



Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}

Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}

Vernon: Go away, ahh!

Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!



Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.



Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!



He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.



Harry: Get off! Ahh!

Vernon: Ahh!

Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!

Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!



Scene:

A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.



Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}



Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.



Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!

Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}

Vernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!

Petunia: Ooh.



Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.



Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}

All: Ahh!

Hagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!

Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.

Harry appears: I-I am.

Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.

Harry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}

Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?



Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.



Harry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?

Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.

Harry: Sorry, no.

Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?

Harry: Learnt what?

Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.

Harry: I-I'm a what?

Harry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.

Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.

Dudley: {whimpers}



Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.



Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

Vernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!

Harry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?

Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

Harry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?

Petunia: We had to tell him something.

Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

Vernon: He'll not be going!

Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?

Harry: Muggle?

Hagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!

Hagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.



Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.



Dudley: Ahh!

All: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}

Harry: {laughs}

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.

Harry: {Nods} Okay.

Hagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}



Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.



Scene:

Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?

Hagrid: If you know where to go.



They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.

{Music and talking}



Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.

Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.



The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.



Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.



A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.



Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.



A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.



Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.

Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}

Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.

Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.

Harry: Good-bye.



The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.



Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!

Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}

Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.



Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.



Hagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.



Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.



Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

Hagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.



Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.



Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?

Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.



The goblin looks up.



Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}

Goblin: Very well.



Scene:

Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.



Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}



The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.



Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?



They continue on through the cavern.



Griphook: Vault 713.

Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?

Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.

Griphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}



Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside in the street, walking.



Harry: I still need...a wand.

Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.



Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.



Harry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?



There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.



Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.

Harry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}

Ollivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.

Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?

Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}

Harry: And...who owned that wand?

Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}



There is a knock on the window.



Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}

Harry: Wow.



Scene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.



Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.

Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Hagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...

Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?

Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.

Harry: Voldemort?

Hagrid: Shh!!

{Harry looks around}



A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.



Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?

Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.

Harry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?

Hagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.





Scene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.



A couple look at Hagrid.



Hagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.



Harry looks at his golden ticket.



Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}



Scene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.



Man: Sorry.

Harry sees a train master.

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.

Trainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.

Harry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?

Trainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}



A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.



Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.

Harry: Muggles?

Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.



A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.



Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.

George: He's not Fred, I am!

Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!

Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}



Harry shakes his head in disbelief.



Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to

Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.

Ginny (daughter): Good luck.



Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.



Scene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.



Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

{Ron goes agape.}

Ron: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...

Harry: The what?

Ron: {whispers} Scar...?

Harry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}

Ron: Wicked.

A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?

Ron: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}

Harry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!

Ron: Whoa!



Scene: Eating bundles of sweets.

Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.



Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?

Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!



Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.



Harry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

Ron: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.

Frog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}

Ron: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!

Ron: I got about 6 of him.

Harry: Hey, he's gone!

Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?

Harry: Just a little bit.

Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?

Harry: Yeah!

Ron: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-



A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.



Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron: No.

Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}



Scene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.



Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!



Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.



Hagrid: Hello, Harry.

Harry: Hey, Hagrid.

Ron: Whoaa!

Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.



Scene:

A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.

Ron: Wicked.



Scene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.



McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup



NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.



Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}

McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}



DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.



Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}

Harry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.



Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.



McGonagall: We're ready for you now.



She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.



Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.

McGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.



Dumbledore rises from the main table.



Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.

McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.

Hermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}

Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.

Harry nods in agreement.

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!

(Cheering)



Hermione jumps off with a smile.



McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.



Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.



Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!



Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.

McGonagall: Susan Bones.



A small, redhead goes up.

Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.



Harry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}

Ron: Harry, what is it?

Harry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.



Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!

McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.



Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.



Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!

Ron: {Sighs}

(Cheering)



McGonagall: Harry Potter.



Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.



Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?

Harry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!



There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.

Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.



McGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.

Dumbledore: Let the feast...begin.



Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.



Harry: Wow.



Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.

Ron stuffs his face.



SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.



Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

Neville laughs.



Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.



Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.

Harry: What's he teach?

Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.



Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.



Ron: Ahh!

Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.



Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.



Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Girl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!

Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?

Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}

Ron: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!

Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.

Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?

Nick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}

Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: Eugh.



Scene:

Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.



Percy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.

Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.



The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.



Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!

Ron: Look at that one, Harry!

Harry: I think she fancies you.

Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?

Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.

Girl: Who's that?



Scene:

Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.



Woman: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.

Girl: Oh, wow.

Percy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.



Scene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.





Scene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.



Ron: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?



The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.



Ron: That was bloody brilliant.

McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.

Harry: We got lost.

McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.



Scene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.



Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.



Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.



Snape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?



Scene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.



Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.



Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...

Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...



ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.



Ron: Ah. Mail's here!



The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.



Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.



Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.



Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!

Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.

Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.

Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.



Scene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.



Hooch: Good afternoon, class.

Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!

Class: Up!



Harry's broom flies into his hand.



Harry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}

Draco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}

Hooch: With feeling!

Hermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.

Ron: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}

Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}



Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.



Neville: Oh...

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.

Girl: Neville, what are you doing?

Students: Neville...Neville...

Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.

Hooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!

Harry: Neville! {shouting}

Neville: Help!!!

Hooch: Come back down this instant!

Neville: AHH!



He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.



Neville: Help!

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}

Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!

Hooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.

Girl: Is he alright?

Neville: Owowowow.

Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}

Draco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.

Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?



Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.



Hermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.



Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.



Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!

Draco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}



Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.



Boy: Good job, Harry!

Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.

McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}



Scene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.



Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient

McGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}

McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!



Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.



Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.

Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in

Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.



Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.



Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!

Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.

George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.

Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.

George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.



Scene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.



Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.

Harry: I-I didn't know.





Scene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.



Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.

Harry: Who doesn't?



The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.



Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: {Gasps.}

Harry: What's happening?

Hermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}

Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.

Ron: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?

Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.



Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.



Harry: Let's go.

{meow}

Ron: It's Filch's cat!

Harry: Run!



The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.



Harry: It's locked!

Ron: That's it, we're done for!

Hermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}

Ron: Alohomora?

Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.



Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.



Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}

Hermione: Filch is gone.

Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.

Hermione: It was locked.

Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}

All: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}



Scene:

Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.



Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.

Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}

Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.

Harry: Guarding something?

Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}

Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.



Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?

Harry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}

Oliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}

Harry: I like this ball.

Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

Harry: What do I do with it?

Oliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}

Harry: Whoa.



Scene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.



Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.

{All practice.}

Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}

Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.



Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.



Hermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}

Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!



Seamus begins swishing at his feather.



Seamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}



BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.



Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.



Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.



Ron: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!



Hermione bustles past, sniffling.



Harry: I think she heard you.



Scene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.



Harry: Where's Hermione?

Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.

{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}



The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.



Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!

Boy: Stay together!



Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.



Scene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.



Percy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!

Harry: How could a troll get in?

Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?

Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!



The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.



Harry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!



Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.



Harry: Hermione, move!



The troll smashes the remaining stalls.



Hermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}

Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}

Hermione: Ahhh! Help!



Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.



Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}

Ron: Ew.



The troll snorts, and whips around.



Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!



The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.



Harry: Do something! {swipe}

Ron: What? {swipe}

Harry: Anything! Hurry up!



Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.



Hermione: Swish and flick!

Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.



Hermione approaches carefully.



Hermione: Is it...dead?

Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.



Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.

They all gasp.



McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!

Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...

Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}

McGonagall: Ms. Granger?

Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.

McGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....



Scene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.



Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.

Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.

Harry: I'm not hungry.



Snape appears.



Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}

Harry: That explains the blood.

Hermione: Blood?

Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.

Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?

Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

Hermione: So you're saying...

Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}

Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?

Harry: But I-I never get mail.

Ron: Let's open it.

{They open it.}

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!

Harry: But who...?

{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}



Scene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.



OIiver: Scared, Harry?

Harry: A little bit.

Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.



Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.



Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!



{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}



The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.



Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.

Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}

Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.



The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.



Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!



Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.



Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}



Harry, in the air, claps.



Harry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!



In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.



Hagrid: Well done!

Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.



Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!



Ron and Seamus: Yay!

Harry: Yes!

Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}

Gryffindors: Yay!



The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.



Flint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}



Crowd: {Booing}

Harry is visibly upset.

Slytherin laughs.



The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.



Flint: {to other members} Take that side!



They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.



Harry: Whoa! Whooa!

Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?



Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.



Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!

Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?

Hermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}



Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.



Ron: Come on, Hermione!



Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.



Hermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.



A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.



Man: Fire! You're on fire!

Snape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}



Ron: Go!

Hagrid: Go go go!



Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.



The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.



Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!



Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.



Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!

Hooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!

All: YAY!

Draco: No!

Hagrid: Yes!

Hermione: Whoo-hoo!

McGonagall: {Giggles happily}



Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.



Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!






Scene:
Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.



Hagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?

Hagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?

Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?

Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the

Harry: Yes?

Hagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.

Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!

Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.

Harry: Exactly.

Hagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

Harry: Nicholas Flamel?

Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}

Harry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?

Hermione: I don't know.



Scene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.



Harry: Knight to E-5.



A piece moves across the board.



Ron thinks for a moment.



Ron: Queen to E-5.



A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.



Hermione: That's totally barbaric!

Ron: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.

Hermione: See you haven't.

Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!

Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.

Ron: We've looked a hundred times!

Hermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}

Ron: I think we've had a bad influence on her.



Scene:

X-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.



Ron: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!



Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.



Ron: Happy Christmas, Harry.

Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?

Ron: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!

Harry: I've got presents?

Ron: Yeah!

Harry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}

Ron: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}

Harry: ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.""



Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.



Ron: What is it?

Harry: Some kind of...cloak.

Ron: Well, let's see then. Put it on.



Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.



Ron: Whoa!

Harry: My body's gone!

Ron: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!

Harry: I'm invisible??

Ron: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.

Harry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well.""



Scene:

Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.



Harry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?



Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.



Man: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!



Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.



Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!



Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.



Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...

Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?

Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.



Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.



Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.



They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.



Harry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.



Scene:

The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.



Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

Ron: Why?

Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!



Scene:

Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.



Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!

Ron: I only see me.

Harry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad

Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}



Scene:

Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.



Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.

Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?

Dumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}



Scene:

Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.



Scene:

In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.



Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

Ron: This is light?

Hermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""

Ron and Harry: The what?

Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""

Ron: Immortal?

Hermione: It means you'll never die.

Ron: I know what it means!

Harry: Shh!

Hermione: ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!



They all look at each other.



Scene:

Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.



Harry: Hagrid!

Hagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}

All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!

{Door reopens.}

Hagrid: Oh.

{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?

Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.

Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!

Harry: What?

Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.

Harry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?
Hermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.

Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?

Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...

Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?

Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.



The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.



Hermione: Is that...a dragon?

Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}

Harry: Norbert?

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?

Ron: {laughs}

Hagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.



Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.



Hagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}

Harry: Malfoy.

Hagrid: Oh, dear.



Scene:

The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.



Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.

Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?

Ron: It's bad.



They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.



McGonagall: Good evening.



Malfoy appears smugly beside her.



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.



McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.

Harry: 50?!

McGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.



Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.



Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us.""



McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.



Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.



Scene:

Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.



Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?



Hagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.

Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.

Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.

Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!

Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}

Hagrid: Right. Let's go.



Scene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.



Harry: Hagrid, what's that?

Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

Ron: {weakly} Okay.

Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}

Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!

Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}



Scene:

Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.



Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.

Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.

Draco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.



Scene:

The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.



Harry: What is it, Fang?



Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.



Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.



Draco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!



Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.



Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

Harry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?

Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.

Harry: But who would choose such a life?

Firenze: Can you think of no one?

Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?

Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?

Harry: The Philosopher's Stone.



Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.



Hermione: Harry!

Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}

Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.

{Close up on the dead unicorn.}


Scene:

Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.



Hermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?

Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}

Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?

Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.

Ron: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!

Hermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?

{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}



Scene:

Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.



Hermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?

Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.

Hermione: It's happened before.

Harry: Not like this.

Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.

Harry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?

Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.

Harry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.

Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""

Harry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

Hagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""



The three gape.



Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.



Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!

McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

Harry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.

McGonagall: {shocked} How do you know

Harry: Someone's going to try and steal it.

McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}



Scene:

After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.



Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone

{Snape suddenly appears behind them}

Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?

Hermione: Uh...we were just...

Snape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Harry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.



Scene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.



Harry: Trevor.

Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!

Neville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?

Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were

Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}

Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.



Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.



Ron: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.

Harry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.

Hermione: Sorry.

Ron: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}



Scene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.



Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!

Ron: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}

Hermione: Alohomora.



The door opens and they go in.



Ron: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.

Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}

Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!

Harry: We have to move its paw.

Ron: What?!

Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?

Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.



Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.



Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}

Harry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}

Ron: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.

Harry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}

Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.

Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!



Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.



Ron and Harry: Hermione!!

Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!

Hermione's voice: Just relax!

Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!

Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.



Harry relaxes and is sucked through.



Ron: Ahh! Harry!



Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.



Ron: Harry!

Hermione: Are you okay?

Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Ron: Help!

Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?

Harry: Apparently not.

Ron: Help! Help me!

Hermione: We've got to do something!

Harry: What?

Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}

Ron: Ahhh!

Harry: Ron, are you okay?

Ron: Yeah.

Harry: Okay.

Ron: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!

Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.



There is a sound.



Hermione: What is that?

Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.



They enter into a room filled with golden ""birds.""



Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.

Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}

Hermione: What's this all about?

Harry: I don't know. Strange.

{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}

Ron: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.

Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!

Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.

Harry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}

Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?

Harry: It's too simple.

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!



Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.



Ron: This complicates things a bit!



Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.



Harry: Catch the key!



He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.



Ron: Hurry up!



The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.



Scene:

They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.



Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

Harry: Where are we? A graveyard.

Ron: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}

Harry: There's the door.



They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.



Hermione: Now what do we do?

Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}

Hermione: What happens now?

Ron: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}

Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?

Ron: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!



The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!

Ron: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.



Harry: Wait a minute.

Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.

Harry: No, Ron! No!

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!

Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!

Ron: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.



Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.



Ron: Check.



The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.



Ron: Ahhhh!

Harry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.

Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.

Harry: Not as good as you.

Hermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.



Harry nods and stands, walking away.





Scene:

Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.



Harry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one

Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?""

Harry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.

Quirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.

Harry: Snape was trying to...save me?

Quirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.

Harry: Th-then you let the troll in.

Quirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?

{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.

Quirrell: Come here, Potter, now!



Harry walks forward shakily.



Quirrell: Tell me. What do you see?



Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.



Quirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!

Harry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.

Voldemort's voice: He lies.

Quirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.

Quirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.

Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.

Harry: Voldemort.

Voldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!



Harry turns and runs.



Voldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!

Harry: {shakes his head} Never!

Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}

Harry: You liar!

Voldemort: Kill him!



Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.



Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}

Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!

Quirrell: {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!



Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!



Voldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!

Harry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}



Scene:

The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.



Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?

Harry: Admirers?

Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.

Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?

Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.

Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

Dumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.

Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...

Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}

Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?

Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry: What is it?

Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.



Scene:

Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.



Harry: All right there, Ron?

Ron: All right? You?

Harry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?

Hermione: {smile} Never better.



Scene:

In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.

Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.

She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.



Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.



There is immense cheering.



Students: Whoo! Yeah!

Draco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}

Dumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}

Harry: {Pats} Good job.

Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}

Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!

Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.



Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.



Dumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!



Cheering.



Hagrid: Yes! {grins}



All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.



Seamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}



All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.



Lee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}



Scene:

The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.



Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.



Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.

Hermione: Come on, Harry.

Harry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}

Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.

Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.

Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}

Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.

Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.



Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.



Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.



The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.2Embed"

He drank his way across the narrow sea.

The ship was small, his cabin smaller, but the captain would not allow him abovedecks. The rocking of the deck beneath his feet made his stomach heave, and the wretched food tasted even worse when retched back up. But why did he need salt beef, hard cheese, and bread crawling with worms when he had wine to nourish him? It was red and sour, very strong. Sometimes he heaved the wine up too, but there was always more.

“The world is full of wine,” he muttered in the dankness of his cabin. His father never had any use for drunkards, but what did that matter? His father was dead. He’d killed him. A bolt in the belly, my lord, and all for you. If only I was better with a crossbow, I would have put it through that cock you made me with, you bloody bastard.

Belowdecks, there was neither night nor day. Tyrion marked time by the comings and goings of the cabin boy who brought the meals he did not eat. The boy always brought a brush and bucket too, to clean up. “Is this Dornish wine?” Tyrion asked him once, as he pulled a stopper from a skin. “It reminds me of a certain snake I knew. A droll fellow, till a mountain fell on him.”

The cabin boy did not answer. He was an ugly boy, though admittedly more comely than a certain dwarf with half a nose and a scar from eye to chin. “Have I offended you?” Tyrion asked, as the boy was scrubbing. “Were you commanded not to talk to me? Or did some dwarf diddle your mother?” That went unanswered too.
Where are we sailing? Tell me that.” Jaime had made mention of the Free Cities, but had never said which one. “Is it Braavos? Tyrosh? Myr?” Tyrion would sooner have gone to Dorne. Myrcella is older than Tommen, by Dornish law the Iron Throne is hers. I will help her claim her rights, as Prince Oberyn suggested.
Oberyn was dead, though, his head smashed to bloody ruin by the armored fist of Ser Gregor Clegane. And without the Red Viper to urge him on, would Doran Martell even consider such a chancy scheme? He might clap me in chains instead and hand me back to my sweet sister. The Wall might be safer. Old Bear Mormont said the Night’s Watch had need of men like Tyrion. Mormont might be dead, though. By now Slynt may be the lord commander. That butcher’s son was not like to have forgotten who sent him to the Wall. Do I really want to spend the rest of my life eating salt beef and porridge with murderers and thieves? Not that the rest of his life would last very long. Janos Slynt would see to that.

The cabin boy wet his brush and scrubbed on manfully.

“Have you ever visited the pleasure houses of Lys?” the dwarf inquired. “Might that be where whores go?” Tyrion could not seem to recall the Valyrian word for whore, and in any case it was too late. The boy tossed his brush back in his bucket and took his leave.

The wine has blurred my wits. He had learned to read High Valyrian at his maester’s knee, though what they spoke in the Nine Free Cities … well, it was not so much a dialect as nine dialects on the way to becoming separate tongues. Tyrion had some Braavosi and a smattering of Myrish. In Tyrosh he should be able to curse the gods, call a man a cheat, and order up an ale, thanks to a sellsword he had once known at the Rock. At least in Dorne they speak the Common Tongue Like Dornish food and Dornish law, Dornish speech was spiced with the flavors of the Rhoyne, but a man could comprehend it. Dorne, yes, Dorne for me. He crawled into his bunk, clutching that thought like a child with a doll.

Sleep had never come easily to Tyrion Lannister. Aboard that ship it seldom came at all, though from time to time he managed to drink sufficient wine to pass out for a while. At least he did not dream. He had dreamed enough for one small life. And of such follies: love, justice, friendship, glory. As well the dream of being tall. It was all beyond his reach, Tyrion knew now. But he did not know where whores go.

“Wherever whores go,” his father had said. His last words, and what words they were.  The crossbow thrummed, Lord Tywin sat back down, and Tyrion Lannister found himself waddling through the darkness with Varys at his side. He must have clambered back down the shaft, two hundred and thirty rungs to where orange embers glowed in the mouth of an iron dragon. He remembered none of it. Only the sound the crossbow made, and the stink of his father’s bowels opening. Even in his dying, he found a way to shit on me.

Varys had escorted him through the tunnels, but they never spoke until they emerged beside the Blackwater, where Tyrion had won a famous victory and lost a nose.

That was when the dwarf turned to the eunuch and said, “I’ve killed my father,” in the same tone a man might use to say,

“I’ve stubbed my toe.”

The master of whisperers had been dressed as a begging brother, in a moth-eaten robe of brown roughspun with a cowl that shadowed his smooth fat cheeks and bald round head. “You should not have climbed that ladder,” he said reproachfully.

“Wherever whores go.” Tyrion had warned his father not to say that word. If I had not loosed, he would have seen my threats were empty. He would have taken the crossbow from my hands, as once he took Tysha from my arms. He was rising when I killed him.

“I killed Shae too,” he confessed to Varys.

“You knew what she was.”
“I did. But I never knew what he was.”

Varys tittered. “And now you do.”

I should have killed the eunuch as well. A little more blood on his hands, what would it matter? He could not say what had stayed his dagger. Not gratitude. Varys had saved him from a headsman’s sword, but only because Jaime had compelled him. Jaime … no, better not to think of Jaime.

He found a fresh skin of wine instead and sucked at it as if it were a woman’s breast. The sour red ran down his chin and soaked through his soiled tunic, the same one he had been wearing in his cell. The deck was swaying beneath his feet, and when he tried to rise it lifted sideways and smashed him hard against a bulkhead. A storm, he realized, or else I am even drunker than I knew. He retched the wine up and lay in it a while, wondering if the ship would sink. Is this your vengeance, Father? Has the Father Above made you his Hand? “Such are the wages of the kinslayer,” he said as the wind howled outside. It did not seem fair to drown the cabin boy and the captain and all the rest for something he had done, but when had the gods ever been fair? And around about then, the darkness gulped him down.

When he stirred again, his head felt like to burst and the ship was spinning round in dizzy circles, though the captain was insisting that they’d come to port. Tyrion told him to be quiet and kicked feebly as a huge bald sailor tucked him under one arm and carried him squirming to the hold, where an empty wine cask awaited him. It was a squat little cask, and a tight fit even for a dwarf. Tyrion pissed himself in his struggles, for all the good it did. He was crammed face-first into the cask with his knees pushed up against his ears. The stub of his nose itched horribly, but his arms were pinned so tightly that he could not reach to scratch it. A palanquin fit for a man of my stature, he thought as they hammered shut the lid. He could hear voices shouting as he was hoisted up. Every bounce cracked his head against the bottom of the cask. The world went round and round as the cask rolled downward, then stopped with a crash that made him want to scream. Another cask slammed into his, and Tyrion bit his tongue.

That was the longest journey he had ever taken, though it could not have lasted more than half an hour. He was lifted and lowered, rolled and stacked, upended and righted and rolled again. Through the wooden staves he heard men shouting, and once a horse whickered nearby. His stunted legs began to cramp, and soon hurt so badly that he forgot the hammering in his head.

It ended as it had begun, with another roll that left him dizzy and more jouncing. Outside, strange voices were speaking in a tongue he did not know. Someone started pounding on the top of the cask and the lid cracked open suddenly. Light came flooding in, and cool air as well. Tyrion gasped greedily and tried to stand, but only managed to knock the cask over sideways and spill himself out onto a hard-packed earthen floor.

Above him loomed a grotesque fat man with a forked yellow beard, holding a wooden mallet and an iron chisel. His bedrobe was large enough to serve as a tourney pavilion, but its loosely knotted belt had come undone, exposing a huge white belly and a pair of heavy breasts that sagged like sacks of suet covered with coarse yellow hair. He reminded Tyrion of a dead sea cow that had once washed up in the caverns under Casterly Rock.

The fat man looked down and smiled. “A drunken dwarf,” he said, in the Common Tongue of Westeros.

“A rotting sea cow.” Tyrion’s mouth was full of blood. He spat it at the fat man’s feet. They were in a long, dim cellar with barrel-vaulted ceilings, its stone walls spotted with nitre. Casks of wine and ale surrounded them, more than enough drink to see a thirsty dwarf safely through the night. Or through a life.

“You are insolent. I like that in a dwarf.” When the fat man laughed, his flesh bounced so vigorously that Tyrion was afraid he might fall and crush him. “Are you hungry, my little friend? Weary?”

“Thirsty.” Tyrion struggled to his knees. “And filthy.”

The fat man sniffed. “A bath first, just so. Then food and a soft bed, yes? My servants shall see to it.” His host put the mallet and chisel aside. “My house is yours. Any friend of my friend across the water is a friend to Illyrio Mopatis, yes.”
And any friend of Varys the Spider is someone I will trust just as far as I can throw him.

The fat man made good on the promised bath, though. No sooner did Tyrion lower himself into the hot water and close his eyes than he was fast asleep. He woke naked on a goose-down feather bed so soft it felt as if he had been swallowed by a cloud. His tongue was growing hair and his throat was raw, but his cock was as hard as an iron bar. He rolled from the bed, found a chamber pot, and commenced to filling it, with a groan of pleasure.

The room was dim, but there were bars of yellow sunlight showing between the slats of the shutters. Tyrion shook the last drops off and waddled over patterned Myrish carpets as soft as new spring grass. Awkwardly he climbed the window seat and flung the shutters open to see where Varys and the gods had sent him.

Beneath his window six cherry trees stood sentinel around a marble pool, their slender branches bare and brown. A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo’s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders. So lifelike did he seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.

Across the pool stood a brick wall twelve feet high, with iron spikes along its top. Beyond that was the city. A sea of tiled rooftops crowded close around a bay. He saw square brick towers, a great red temple, a distant manse upon a hill. In the far distance, sunlight shimmered off deep water. Fishing boats were moving across the bay, their sails rippling in the wind, and he could see the masts of larger ships poking up along the shore. Surely one is bound for Dorne, or for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea He had no means to pay for passage, though, nor was he made to pull an oar. I suppose I could sign on as a cabin boy and earn my way by letting the crew bugger me up and down the narrow sea.

He wondered where he was. Even the air smells different here. Strange spices scented the chilly autumn wind, and he could hear faint cries drifting over the wall from the streets beyond. It sounded something like Valyrian, but he did not recognize more than one word in five. Not Braavos, he concluded, nor Tyrosh Those bare branches and the chill in the air argued against Lys and Myr and Volantis as well.

When he heard the door opening behind him, Tyrion turned to confront his fat host. “This is Pentos, yes?”

“Just so. Where else?”

Pentos. Well, it was not King’s Landing, that much could be said for it.

“Where do whores go?” he heard himself ask.

“Whores are found in brothels here, as in Westeros. You will have no need of such, my little friend. Choose from amongst my servingwomen. None will dare refuse you.”

“Slaves?” the dwarf asked pointedly.

The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. “Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.” Illyrio gave a ponderous half bow. “But now my little friend must excuse me. I have the honor to be a magister of this great city, and the prince has summoned us to session.” He smiled, showing a mouth full of crooked yellow teeth. “Explore the manse and grounds as you like, but on no account stray beyond the walls. It is best that no man knows that you were here.”

“Were? Have I gone somewhere?”

“Time enough to speak of that this evening. My little friend and I shall eat and drink and make great plans, yes?”

“Yes, my fat friend,” Tyrion replied.

He thinks to use me for his profit. It was all profit with the merchant princes of the Free Cities. “Spice soldiers and cheese lords,” his lord father called them, with contempt. Should a day ever dawn when Illyrio Mopatis saw more profit in a dead dwarf than a live one, Tyrion would find himself packed into another wine cask by dusk. It would be well if I was gone before that day arrives. That it would arrive he did not doubt; Cersei was not like to forget him, and even Jaime might be vexed to find a quarrel in Father’s belly.

A light wind was riffling the waters of the pool below, all around the naked swordsman. It reminded him of how Tysha would riffle his hair during the false spring of their marriage, before he helped his father’s guardsmen rape her. He had been thinking of those guardsmen during his flight, trying to recall how many there had been. You would think he might remember that, but no. A dozen? A score? A hundred? He could not say.

They had all been grown men, tall and strong … though all men were tall to a dwarf of thirteen years. Tysha knew their number. Each of them had given her a silver stag, so she would only need to count the coins. A silver for each and a gold for me. His father had insisted that he pay her too. A Lannister always pays his debts.

“Wherever whores go,” he heard Lord Tywin say once more, and once more the bowstring thrummed.

The magister had invited him to explore the manse. He found clean clothes in a cedar chest inlaid with lapis and mother-of-pearl. The clothes had been made for a small boy, he realized as he struggled into them.

The fabrics were rich enough, if a little musty, but the cut was too long in the legs and too short in the arms, with a collar that would have turned his face as black as Joffrey’s had he somehow contrived to get it fastened. Moths had been at them too. At least they do not stink of vomit.

Tyrion began his explorations with the kitchen, where two fat women and a potboy watched him warily as he helped himself to cheese, bread, and figs. “Good morrow to you, fair ladies,” he said with a bow. “Do you know where whores go?” When they did not respond, he repeated the question in High Valyrian, though he had to say courtesan in place of whore. The younger, fatter cook gave him a shrug that time.

He wondered what they would do if he took them by the hand and dragged them to his bedchamber. None will dare refuse you, Illyrio claimed, but somehow Tyrion did not think he meant these two. The younger woman was old enough to be his mother, and the older was likely her mother. Both were near as fat as Illyrio, with teats that were larger than his head. I could smother myself in flesh. There were worse ways to die. The way his lord father had died, for one. I should have made him shit a little gold before expiring. Lord Tywin might have been niggardly with his approval and affection, but he had always been open-handed when it came to coin.The only thing more pitiful than a dwarf without a nose is a dwarf without a nose who has no gold.

Tyrion left the fat women to their loaves and kettles and went in search of the cellar where Illyrio had decanted him the night before. It was not hard to find. There was enough wine there to keep him drunk for a hundred years; sweet reds from the Reach and sour reds from Dorne, pale Pentoshi ambers, the green nectar of Myr, three score casks of Arbor gold, even wines from the fabled east, from Qarth and Yi Ti and Asshai by the Shadow. In the end, Tyrion chose a cask of strongwine marked as the private stock of Lord Runceford Redwyne, the grandfather of the present Lord of the Arbor. The taste of it was languorous and heady on the tongue, the color a purple so dark that it looked almost black in the dim-lit cellar. Tyrion filled a cup, and a flagon for good measure, and carried them up to the gardens to drink beneath those cherry trees he’d seen.

As it happened, he left by the wrong door and never found the pool he had spied from his window, but it made no matter. The gardens behind the manse were just as pleasant, and far more extensive. He wandered through them for a time, drinking. The walls would have shamed any proper castle, and the ornamental iron spikes along the top looked strangely naked without heads to adorn them.

Tyrion pictured how his sister’s head might look up there, with tar in her golden hair and flies buzzing in and out of her mouth. Yes, and Jaime must have the spike beside her, he decided. No one must ever come between my brother and my sister.

With a rope and a grapnel he might be able to get over that wall. He had strong arms and he did not weigh much. He should be able to clamber over, if he did not impale himself on a spike. I will search for a rope on the morrow, he resolved.

He saw three gates during his wanderings—the main entrance with its gatehouse, a postern by the kennels, and a garden gate hidden behind a tangle of pale ivy. The last was chained, the others guarded. The guards were plump, their faces as smooth as babies’ bottoms, and every man of them wore a spiked bronze cap. Tyrion knew eunuchs when he saw them. He knew their sort by reputation. They feared nothing and felt no pain, it was said, and were loyal to their masters unto death. I could make good use of a few hundred of mine own, he reflected. A pity I did not think of that before I became a beggar.

He walked along a pillared gallery and through a pointed arch, and found himself in a tiled courtyard where a woman was washing clothes at a well. She looked to be his own age, with dull red hair and a broad face dotted by freckles. “Would you like some wine?” he asked her. She looked at him uncertainly. “I have no cup for you, we’ll have to share.” The washerwoman went back to wringing out tunics and hanging them to dry. Tyrion settled on a stone bench with his flagon. “Tell me, how far should I trust Magister Illyrio?” The name made her look up. “That far?” Chuckling, he crossed his stunted legs and took a drink. “I am loath to play whatever part the cheesemonger has in mind for me, yet how can I refuse him? The gates are guarded. Perhaps you might smuggle me out under your skirts? I’d be so grateful; why, I’ll even wed you. I have two wives already, why not three? Ah, but where would we live?” He gave her as pleasant a smile as a man with half a nose could manage. “I have a niece in Sunspear, did I tell you? I could make rather a lot of mischief in Dorne with Myrcella. I could set my niece and nephew at war, wouldn’t that be droll?” The washerwoman pinned up one of Illyrio’s tunics, large enough to double as a sail. “I should be ashamed to think such evil thoughts, you’re quite right. Better if I sought the Wall instead. All crimes are wiped clean when a man joins the Night’s Watch, they say. Though I fear they would not let me keep you, sweetling. No women in the Watch, no sweet freckly wives to warm your bed at night, only cold winds, salted cod, and small beer. Do you think I might stand taller in black, my lady?” He filled his cup again. “What do you say? North or south? Shall I atone for old sins or make some new ones?”

The washerwoman gave him one last glance, picked up her basket, and walked away.

I cannot seem to hold a wife for very long, Tyrion reflected. Somehow his flagon had gone dry. Perhaps I should stumble back down to the cellars. The strongwine was making his head spin, though, and the cellar steps were very steep. “Where do whores go?” he asked the wash flapping on the line. Perhaps he should have asked the washerwoman. Not to imply that you’re a whore, my dear, but perhaps you know where they go. Or better yet, he should have asked his father. “Wherever whores go,” Lord Tywin said. She loved me. She was a crofter’s daughter, she loved me and she wed me, she put her trust in me.

The empty flagon slipped from his hand and rolled across the yard. Tyrion pushed himself off the bench and went to fetch it. As he did, he saw some mushrooms growing up from a cracked paving tile. Pale white they were, with speckles, and red-ribbed undersides dark as blood. The dwarf snapped one off and sniffed it. Delicious, he thought, and deadly.

There were seven of the mushrooms. Perhaps the Seven were trying to tell him something. He picked them all, snatched a glove down from the line, wrapped them carefully, and stuffed them down his pocket. The effort made him dizzy, so afterward he crawled back onto the bench, curled up, and shut his eyes.

When he woke again, he was back in his bedchamber, drowning in the goose-down feather bed once more while a blond girl shook his shoulder.

“My lord,” she said, “your bath awaits. Magister Illyrio expects you at table within the hour.”

Tyrion propped himself against the pillows, his head in his hands. “Do I dream, or do you speak the Common Tongue?”

“Yes, my lord. I was bought to please the king.” She was blue-eyed and fair, young and willowy.

“I am sure you did. I need a cup of wine.”

She poured for him.

“Magister Illyrio said that I am to scrub your back and warm your bed.

My name—”

“—is of no interest to me. Do you know where whores go?”

She flushed.

“Whores sell themselves for coin.”

“Or jewels, or gowns, or castles. But where do they go?”

The girl could not grasp the question.

“Is it a riddle, m’lord? I’m no good at riddles. Will you tell me the answer?”

No, he thought. I despise riddles, myself. “I will tell you nothing. Do me the same favor.” The only part of you that interests me is the part between your legs, he almost said. The words were on his tongue, but somehow never passed his lips. She is not Shae, the dwarf told himself, only some little fool who thinks I play at riddles. If truth be told, even her cunt did not interest him much. I must be sick, or dead. “You mentioned a bath? We must not keep the great cheesemonger waiting.”

As he bathed, the girl washed his feet, scrubbed his back, and brushed his hair. Afterward she rubbed sweet-smelling ointment into his calves to ease the aches, and dressed him once again in boy’s clothing, a musty pair of burgundy breeches and a blue velvet doublet lined with cloth-of-gold. “Will my lord want me after he has eaten?” she asked as she was lacing up his boots.

“No. I am done with women.” Whores.

The girl took that disappointment too well for his liking. “If m’lord would prefer a boy, I can have one waiting in his bed.”

M’lord would prefer his wife. M’lord would prefer a girl named Tysha. “Only if he knows where whores go.”

The girl’s mouth tightened. She despises me, he realized, but no more than I despise myself. That he had fucked many a woman who loathed the very sight of him, Tyrion Lannister had no doubt, but the others had at least the grace to feign affection. A little honest loathing might be refreshing, like a tart wine after too much sweet.

“I believe I have changed my mind,” he told her. “Wait for me abed. Naked, if you please, I’ll be a deal too drunk to fumble at your clothing. Keep your mouth shut and your thighs open and the two of us should get on splendidly.” He gave her a leer, hoping for a taste of fear, but all she gave him was revulsion. No one fears a dwarf. Even Lord Tywin had not been afraid, though Tyrion had held a crossbow in his hands. “Do you moan when you are being fucked?” he asked the bedwarmer.

“If it please m’lord.”

“It might please m’lord to strangle you. That’s how I served my last whore. Do you think your master would object? Surely not. He has a hundred more like you, but no one else like me.” This time, when he grinned, he got the fear he wanted.

Illyrio was reclining on a padded couch, gobbling hot peppers and pearl onions from a wooden bowl. His brow was dotted with beads of sweat, his pig’s eyes shining above his fat cheeks.

Jewels danced when he moved his hands; onyx and opal, tiger’s eye and tourmaline, ruby, amethyst, sapphire, emerald, jet and jade, a black diamond, and a green pearl. I could live for years on his rings, Tyrion mused, though I’d need a cleaver to claim them.

“Come sit, my little friend.” Illyrio waved him closer.

The dwarf clambered up onto a chair. It was much too big for him, a cushioned throne intended to accommodate the magister’s massive buttocks, with thick sturdy legs to bear his weight. Tyrion Lannister had lived all his life in a world that was too big for him, but in the manse of Illyrio Mopatis the sense of disproportion assumed grotesque dimensions. I am a mouse in a mammoth’s lair, he mused, though at least the mammoth keeps a good cellar. The thought made him thirsty. He called for wine.

“Did you enjoy the girl I sent you?” Illyrio asked.

“If I had wanted a girl I would have asked for one.”

“If she failed to please …”

“She did all that was required of her.”

“I would hope so. She was trained in Lys, where they make an art of love. The king enjoyed her greatly.”

“I kill kings, hadn’t you heard?” Tyrion smiled evilly over his wine cup. “I want no royal leavings.”

“As you wish. Let us eat.” Illyrio clapped his hands together, and serving men came running.

They began with a broth of crab and monkfish, and cold egg lime soup as well. Then came quails in honey, a saddle of lamb, goose livers drowned in wine, buttered parsnips, and suckling pig. The sight of it all made Tyrion feel queasy, but he forced himself to try a spoon of soup for the sake of politeness, and once he had tasted it he was lost. The cooks might be old and fat, but they knew their business. He had never eaten so well, even at court.

As he was sucking the meat off the bones of his quail, he asked Illyrio about the morning’s summons. The fat man shrugged.

“There are troubles in the east. Astapor has fallen, and Meereen. Ghiscari slave cities that were old when the world was young.” The suckling pig was carved. Illyrio reached for a piece of the crackling, dipped it in a plum sauce, and ate it with his fingers.

“Slaver’s Bay is a long way from Pentos.” Tyrion speared a goose liver on the point of his knife. No man is as cursed as the kinslayer, he mused, but I could learn to like this hell.

“This is so,” Illyrio agreed, “but the world is one great web, and a man dare not touch a single strand lest all the others tremble.

More wine?” Illyrio popped a pepper into his mouth.

“No, something better.” He clapped his hands together.

At the sound a serving man entered with a covered dish. He placed it in front of Tyrion, and Illyrio leaned across the table to remove the lid. “Mushrooms,” the magister announced, as the smell wafted up. “Kissed with garlic and bathed in butter. I am told the taste is exquisite. Have one, my friend. Have two.”

Tyrion had a fat black mushroom halfway to his mouth, but something in Illyrio’s voice made him stop abruptly. “After you, my lord.” He pushed the dish toward his host.

“No, no.” Magister Illyrio pushed the mushrooms back. For a heartbeat it seemed as if a mischievous boy was peering out from inside the cheesemonger’s bloated flesh. “After you. I insist. Cook made them specially for you.”

“Did she indeed?” He remembered the cook, the flour on her hands, heavy breasts shot through with dark blue veins. “That was kind of her, but … no.” Tyrion eased the mushroom back into the lake of butter from which it had emerged.

“You are too suspicious.” Illyrio smiled through his forked yellow beard. Oiled every morning to make it gleam like gold, Tyrion suspected. “Are you craven? I had not heard that of you.”

“In the Seven Kingdoms it is considered a grave breach of hospitality to poison your guest at supper.”

“Here as well.” Illyrio Mopatis reached for his wine cup. “Yet when a guest plainly wishes to end his own life, why, his host must oblige him, no?” He took a gulp. “Magister Ordello was poisoned by a mushroom not half a year ago. The pain is not so much, I am told. Some cramping in the gut, a sudden ache behind the eyes, and it is done. Better a mushroom than a sword through your neck, is it not so? Why die with the taste of blood in your mouth when it could be butter and garlic?”

The dwarf studied the dish before him. The smell of garlic and butter had his mouth watering. Some part of him wanted those mushrooms, even knowing what they were. He was not brave enough to take cold steel to his own belly, but a bite of mushroom would not be so hard. That frightened him more than he could say. “You mistake me,” he heard himself say.

“Is it so? I wonder. If you would sooner drown in wine, say the word and it shall be done, and quickly. Drowning cup by cup wastes time and wine both.”

“You mistake me,” Tyrion said again, more loudly. The buttered mushrooms glistened in the lamplight, dark and inviting.

“I have no wish to die, I promise you. I have …” His voice trailed off into uncertainty. What do I have? A life to live? Work to do? Children to raise, lands to rule, a woman to love?

“You have nothing,” finished Magister Illyrio, “but we can change that.” He plucked a mushroom from the butter, and chewed it lustily. “Delicious.”

“The mushrooms are not poisoned.” Tyrion was irritated.

“No. Why should I wish you ill?” Magister Illyrio ate another. “We must show a little trust, you and I. Come, eat.” He clapped his hands again. “We have work to do. My little friend must keep his strength up.”

The serving men brought out a heron stuffed with figs, veal cutlets blanched with almond milk, creamed herring, candied onions, foul-smelling cheeses, plates of snails and sweetbreads, and a black swan in her plumage. Tyrion refused the swan, which reminded him of a supper with his sister. He helped himself to heron and herring, though, and a few of the sweet onions. And the serving men filled his wine cup anew each time he emptied it.

“You drink a deal of wine for such a little man.”

“Kinslaying is dry work. It gives a man a thirst.”

The fat man’s eyes glittered like the gemstones on his fingers. “There are those in Westeros who would say that killing Lord Lannister was merely a good beginning.”

“They had best not say it in my sister’s hearing, or they will find themselves short a tongue.” The dwarf tore a loaf of bread in half. “And you had best be careful what you say of my family, magister. Kinslayer or no, I am a lion still.”

That seemed to amuse the lord of cheese no end.

He slapped a meaty thigh and said, “You Westerosi are all the same. You sew some beast upon a scrap of silk, and suddenly you are all lions or dragons or eagles. I can take you to a real lion, my little friend. The prince keeps a pride in his menagerie. Would you like to share a cage with them?”

The lords of the Seven Kingdoms did make rather much of their sigils, Tyrion had to admit. “Very well,” he conceded. “A Lannister is not a lion. Yet I am still my father’s son, and Jaime and Cersei are mine to kill.”

“How odd that you should mention your fair sister,” said Illyrio, between snails. “The queen has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head, no matter how humble his birth.”

It was no more than Tyrion had expected. “If you mean to take her up on it, make her spread her legs for you as well. The best part of me for the best part of her, that’s a fair trade.”

“I would sooner have mine own weight in gold.”

The cheesemonger laughed so hard that Tyrion feared he was about to rupture.

“All the gold in Casterly Rock, why not?”

“The gold I grant you,” the dwarf said, relieved that he was not about to drown in a gout of half-digested eels and sweetmeats, “but the Rock is mine.”

“Just so.” The magister covered his mouth and belched a mighty belch. “Do you think King Stannis will give it to you? I am told he is a great one for the law. Your brother wears the white cloak, so you are heir by all the laws of Westeros.”

“Stannis might well grant me Casterly Rock,” said Tyrion, “but for the small matter of regicide and kinslaying. For those he would shorten me by a head, and I am short enough as I stand. But why would you think I mean to join Lord Stannis?”

“Why else would you go the Wall?”

“Stannis is at the Wall?” Tyrion rubbed at his nose. “What in seven bloody hells is Stannis doing at the Wall?”

“Shivering, I would think. It is warmer down in Dorne. Perhaps he should have sailed that way.”

Tyrion was beginning to suspect that a certain freckled washerwoman knew more of the Common Speech than she pretended. “My niece Myrcella is in Dorne, as it happens. And I have half a mind to make her a queen.”

Illyrio smiled as his serving men spooned out bowls of black cherries in sweet cream for them both. “What has this poor child done to you that you would wish her dead?”

“Even a kinslayer is not required to slay all his kin,” said Tyrion, wounded. “Queen her, I said. Not kill her.”

The cheesemonger spooned up cherries. “In Volantis they use a coin with a crown on one face and a death’s-head on the other. Yet it is the same coin. To queen her is to kill her. Dorne might rise for Myrcella, but Dorne alone is not enough. If you are as clever as our friend insists, you know this.”

Tyrion looked at the fat man with new interest. He is right on both counts. To queen her is to kill her. And I knew that.  “Futile gestures are all that remain to me. This one would make my sister weep bitter tears, at least.”

Magister Illyrio wiped sweet cream from his mouth with the back of a fat hand. “The road to Casterly Rock does not go through Dorne, my little friend. Nor does it run beneath the Wall. Yet there is such a road, I tell you.”

“I am an attainted traitor, a regicide, and kinslayer.” This talk of roads annoyed him.

Does he think this is a game?

“What one king does, another may undo. In Pentos we have a prince, my friend. He presides at ball and feast and rides about the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold. Three heralds go before him with the golden scales of trade, the iron sword of war, and the silver scourge of justice. On the first day of each new year he must deflower the maid of the fields and the maid of the seas.” Illyrio leaned forward, elbows on the table. “Yet should a crop fail or a war be lost, we cut his throat to appease the gods and choose a new prince from amongst the forty families.”

“Remind me never to become the Prince of Pentos.”

“Are your Seven Kingdoms so different? There is no peace in Westeros, no justice, no faith … and soon enough, no food. When men are starving and sick of fear, they look for a savior.”

“They may look, but if all they find is Stannis—”

“Not Stannis.

Nor Myrcella.”

The yellow smile widened.

“Another. Stronger than Tommen, gentler than Stannis, with a better claim than the girl Myrcella. A savior come from across the sea to bind up the wounds of bleeding Westeros.”

“Fine words.” Tyrion was unimpressed.

“Words are wind. Who is this bloody savior?”

“A dragon.” The cheesemonger saw the look on his face at that, and laughed.

“A dragon with three heads.”7Embed"

A Halo Called Fred,Hypothetical Twist,0.589,0.68,7.0,-8.635,1.0,0.114,0.775,5.71e-06,0.0908,0.963,95.089,153480.0,4.0,"Genetic Engineering and Diseases – Gene Drive & Malaria LyricsWhat if you could use genetic engineering to stop humanity's most dangerous predator, the deadliest animal on the planet responsible for the death of billions, the mighty mosquito? Along with other diseases it plays host to Malaria, one of the cruellest parasites on Earth possibly the single biggest killer of humans in history. In 2015 alone hundreds of millions were infected and almost half a million-people died. A new technology could help us eradicate Malaria forever, but to do so we need to engineer a whole animal population. This is not a hypothetical problem; the modified mosquitoes already exist in a lab. Should we use the technology, and is malaria bad enough to risk it?

Malaria is caused by a group of microorganisms: Plasmodia, very weird microorganisms that consists of just a single-cell, they're parasites that completely rely on mosquitoes. Malaria always starts with an insect bite. In it's salivary glands, thousands of sporozoites wait until the insect penetrates your skin, immediately after invading you they head for the liver where they quietly enter big cells and hide from the immune system. For up to a month they stay here in stealth mode consuming the cells alive and changing into their next form: small drop like merozoites, they multiply generating thousands of themselves and then burst out of the cells. So thousands of parasites head into the bloodstream to look for their next victims, Red blood cells, to stay unnoticed, they wrap themselves in the membranes of the cells they killed. Imagine that! Killing someone from the inside and then taking their skin as camouflage, brutal! They now violently attack red blood cells, multiplying inside them until they burst then finding more red blood cells and this cycle repeats over and over. Pieces of dead cells spread lots of toxic waste material, which activates a powerful immune response causing flu-like symptoms, among the symptoms are high fever, sweats and chills, convulsions, headaches and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. If malaria breaches the blood-brain barrier it can cause coma, neurological damage or death. The parasites are ready for evacuation now. When another mosquito bites the infected human, they get a ride, the cycle can start over. In 2015, the Zika virus, which causes horrible birth defects if it infects pregnant women, spread rapidly into new areas around the globe. It too is carried by a mosquito. The mosquito is the perfect carrier for human diseases they've been around for at least 200 million years. There are trillions of them and a single one can lay up to 300 eggs at a time. They are practically impossible to eradicate and the perfect parasite taxi. But today we have a new revolutionary technology, that could enable us to finally win the war against them; CRISPR. For the first time in human history, we have the tools to make fast, large-scale changes to entire species, changing their genetic information as we please. So instead of attacking isolated groups of insects, why not just change the types that transmit diseases? Using genetic engineering, scientists successfully created a strain of mosquitoes that are immune to the malaria parasite by adding a new antibody gene that specifically targets plasmodium. These mosquitoes will never spread malaria. But just changing genetic information is not enough. The edits would only be inherited by half the offspring because most genes have two versions inside the genome as a fail-safe. So after just two generations, at most only half of the offspring would carry the engineered gene. In a population of billions of mosquitoes, they would hardly make a difference. A genetic engineering method called the gene drive solves this problem. It forces the new gene to become dominant in the following generations overpowering the old gene almost completely. Thanks to this twist, 99.5% of all the engineered mosquitoes offspring will carry the anti-malaria edit. If we were to release enough engineered mosquitoes into the wild to mate with normal mosquitoes, the malaria blocking gene would spread extremely quickly. As the new gene becomes a permanent feature of the mosquito population, Plasmodium would lose its home base. Scientists hope that the change would be so fast that they could not adapt to it quickly enough. Malaria could virtually disappear. If you take into account that maybe half a million children are killed by it every year, about five have died since this video started. Some scientists argue that we should use the technology sooner, rather than later. The mosquitoes themselves would probably only profit from this, they don't have anything to gain from carrying parasites and this might only be the first step Malaria might just be the beginning. Different mosquitoes also carry Dengue fever and Zika, ticks transmit Lyme disease, flies transmit sleeping sickness fleas transmit the plague. We could save millions of lives and prevent suffering on an unbelievable scale. So, why haven't we done this yet? For one, CRISPR editing is barely four years old, so until very recently we just couldn't do it as fast and easily. And there are valid concerns. Never before have humans consciously changed the genetic code of a free-living organism on this scale. Once we do it, there is no going back. So it has to be done right, because there could be unwanted consequences if we set out to edit nature. In this specific case of malaria though, the risk might be acceptable since the genetic modification doesn't make a big change in the overall genome. It only changes a very specific part. The worst-case scenario here, is probably that it might not work or that the parasite adapts in a negative way. There is still much debate. Technology as powerful as gene drive, needs to be handled with a lot of care but at some point, we have to ask ourselves: Is it unethical to not use this technology, when every day 1,000 children die. Humanity has to decide how to act on this in the next few years. The public discussion is way behind the technology in this case. What do you think?Embed"

I woke up early, before anyone else. I went down to the game room, and went on my laptop to check my dad’s email. I expected it to be empty, but to my surprise, he had gotten a message - make that three messages - on his online dating profile, all from the same person. I decided I would show him when he came downstairs. That didn’t take long, as he was the second one down, just a few minutes after me. I showed him, and he sat down and started typing frantically. Shane, Graham, and I hung out around the house all day while my dad continued to type back and forth. Finally, after dinner, he called me into the room. “What do you think about coming with me to dinner tomorrow night?” I knew Shane and Graham had something, so I didn’t mention them, and simply said “okay,” assuming he was going on a date.
	
	I decided to sleep in. When I got up at 11:30, it was because Graham was pulling on my sheets, telling me to get ready to take him to Boy Scouts. I shooed him away and got up, taking a shower and putting on a simple white T-shirt and white basketball shorts. Shane decided that he would go with Graham, at least for the first meeting. We had filled out the paperwork for Graham last week, but Shane had to sign up. Luckily, they didn’t require a parent’s signature or anything, so they were both able to register. I hung around and watched, so I didn’t have to leave and come back. After the meeting, both kids reported back positively, so I told the leader we would bring them to the sleepover tonight. We drove home, Graham and Shane chatting excitedly in the backseat the whole time.

	When we got back home, Graham and Shane ran up to their rooms to start packing for the sleepover. I had gotten a flyer for the sleepover, and I took the opportunity to read it. While the event wasn’t actually sponsored by the Scouts, it was at a Scout’s house, and only the kids in that troop were invited. Doors opened at 5:00, so I could drop them off, then meet my dad at dinner.

***

I ran into my room to pack for the sleepover. We had gotten a packing list, which said we needed: two outfits (one to sleep in, one to wear tomorrow), a Bible, toiletries (like soap, toothbrush and all that stuff), and a ball from our favorite sport. I immediately went to get my soccer ball, and I finished packing in about 15 minutes. I then went into Shane’s room to help him pack, and he was also done, except he didn’t have a Bible. I told him he could borrow Will’s, and handed it to him. Since we were done, we just got to hang out for a while before we left.
***

I changed into a white dress shirt and nice jeans to go to dinner, but first I had to drop Graham and Shane off at the sleepover. It was at Ryan Williams’ house. Of course, I thought. Ryan didn’t live in our neighborhood, so I had to drive a decent way to get there. After I dropped them off, I had to drive all the way to Fort Worth to meet my dad and his date at this bar called Fred’s Texas Cafe. I took Interstate 30 to Lancaster, and turned right on the street that the bar was on. A woman came in, saw my dad, and came over toward us. My dad introduced myself, and I did the same. “Nice to meet both of you, I’m Jill Kingsley,” she said. They didn’t seem to get along as well in person as they did in real life, and Jill got up and left before she even ordered any food. I finished eating, but my dad wasn’t done. He saw another woman by herself, and went over to talk to her. I followed, and as before, we introduced ourselves, my dad first, then me, then the woman, Amy. My dad and Amy sat down and talked for a long time. About 20 minutes into the conversation, I asked my dad if I could go home, he said yes, and I left.

	I got home and had the house all to myself. My dad texted me and asked me to prepare a bag for him with clothes for the next day, and his phone charger, and that he would swing by in ten minutes. I ran upstairs, shoved everything into his briefcase, and was done in five minutes. My dad came by in his truck with Amy, and I went out and handed him the bag. “Love you,” he said as he squeezed my shoulder. “Love you,” I called out after him as he drove off.

	After he left, I had command of the house until I had to go pick up Shane and Graham after lunch. I figured I would just relax and maybe watch some baseball, but then Yates invited me over. I packed another bag, this time for myself, and headed on foot over to Yates’ home, just around the corner. When I got there, his parents were gone. “Date night?” I asked. “Yeah, how’d you know?” Yates replied as he let me in. “Same at mi casa,” I said. “Cool, so, what do you wanna do?” “I don’t know, when are your parents going to be home?” “Well, it’s date night tonight, but then they both go out of town for work, so…next Friday.” “So, basically, we can do whatever we want?” “Yep,” Yates said.

	I heard a noise that sounded like part of a song - a ringtone, perhaps? I called Yates’ attention to it, and he went and picked up the phone. “Hello? -Yeah, sure, you can come over. Bring whoever you want, it’s just me and Will chilling over here. Okay, bye-“ Yates hung up. “Who was that?” “Carson and Cooper Stephens- you know them, right? They’re gonna be freshmen in the fall, and they play baseball and basketball. They said they might bring some friends.” “Hey, but we can’t let this get too big,” I said, “‘cause then Jake will try to compete with us, and that won’t end well.” “Jake?” “Durham. You might know him as ‘Snake’.” “Oh, okay, yeah…yeah, I won’t invite anyone else,” Yates said. A few minutes later, Carson and Cooper showed up with two smaller kids in tow. Yates mouthed, “what the-“ towards them, and Carson mouthed back, “babysitting”. They came in, and the bigger of the two kids shook my hand. “Hi, I’m Robert, but everyone calls me Robby,” he said. The smaller kid said, “My name’s Matthew, but everyone calls me Matty.” “Robby’s real smart, and likes to read, and Matty’s pretty outgoing, and likes telling jokes,” said Carson. Cooper whispered something to Carson. “Oh, and Matty likes soccer.” “When do you guys usually go to bed?” I asked. Matty, joking, said, “Well, Robby’s supposed to go to bed at 8, but I can stay up ’til midnight.” “Isn’t it the other way around?” Robby asked, also joking. “Seriously, though, we don’t have a bedtime. As long as we don’t keep our parents up, we can stay up however long we want,” Robby explained. “Cool, well, don’t stay up too late,” I said.

	We decided that the kids seemed trustworthy, and so we went outside, and just kept an eye on them. Yates set up his iPod to play music through a portable speaker. I recognized the first song immediately. “Isn’t this your ringtone?” I asked. “Yeah,” said Yates. “Cool, what’s it called?” “It’s a song by Mac Miller, off his mixtape Faces, called ‘Rain’. It’s one of my favorite songs on the tape,” Yates responded. We started shooting hoops, and it eventually turned into a two-on-two game - Carson and Cooper against me and Yates. “Losers have to watch the kids!” Yates said. Yates and I won the game, because we were both able to shoot the ball, and Carson couldn’t defend both of us, and Cooper didn’t want to defend the perimeter. After the game, we went inside and started an NBA 2K14 tournament. Yates and I played first, while Carson and Cooper watched the kids downstairs. Yates won, like the game we had played the other day. We came downstairs, and switched places with them. Both brothers liked video games, and I knew they both liked sports games, but I did not know who was better at 2K. They came down, and Carson told us that Cooper had beaten him. Carson and I went upstairs to play for third place, and Carson, playing as the Heat, crushed my Mavericks, 102 to 85. Cooper and Yates came up and played for the championship, and Robby and Matty came up to watch. Going into the fourth quarter, Cooper’s Timberwolves had 76, and Yates’ Bulls had 80, but Cooper quickly went on a 9-2 run to make it 85-82. With one minute left, both teams had 98 points. Cooper called timeout, and ran a play for Kevin Love, who made a 3. Yates kept attacking the basket like he had been, and quickly scored six points on three layups and two steals. Cooper scored another three points, this time by another Kevin (Martin), tying the game. With just 12.5 seconds, Yates drove and scored again on a layup by Derrick Rose. Cooper threw the ball to half-court, and called another timeout. The clock was down to 2.9 seconds, but that was enough time for a pass to Love, who tied the game with a 2-point shot.

	We paused the game and went downstairs for a snack and bathroom break. Yates got out a box of cookies - six chocolate chip, six sugar - a 2-liter of Coke, and cups, and we dug in. Cooper and I just got water from the fridge. Carson had one chocolate chip cookie and some water, Robby also just had water, and Matty had two sugar cookies and some Coke. Yates ate one of each type of cookie as well as most of the Coke. We then took the snacks back up to Yates’s room and finished the game. In overtime, the game turned into a two-man show for both teams - Rose and Joakim Noah for the Bulls, and Love and Martin for Minnesota. It turned into a projection of real life - Yates primarily attacking inside, Carson mostly shooting from the perimeter, but as Love and Martin were both good shooters, and their shots were worth more than Yates’s, Carson went up by five with one minute to go. However, Yates’s sources of points were even more reliable than Carson’s, and he converted two and-ones to tie the game. Carson came down the floor, and shocked Yates by shooting with his pass-first point guard, Ricky Rubio, who made the shot to go up by two! With Carson playing tough inside defense, Yates altered his strategy, passing around the perimeter, and it paid off as he made the game-winning 3-pointer! Carson tried to act mad, but high-fived Yates.

	Yates turned the PS4 and the TV off, and we went downstairs to figure out the rest of the night. We all needed to take showers, and we decided to go by age - Matty, Robby, Carson, Cooper, me, then Yates last. Since the house had two showers, we went two at a time, one in Yates’ bathroom and one in the guest bathroom. Matty took a quick shower and came down in a blue tank top and white basketball shorts. Robby took his time, and by the time he was finished, Carson had already taken his shower, brushed his teeth, and changed into a blue T-shirt and shorts. Cooper went upstairs, and I followed not a minute later, after Robby came downstairs wearing SpongeBob pajamas. Both of us took fairly quick showers, brushed our teeth, and went back downstairs to wait for Yates. Cooper had put on a gray T-shirt and shorts, and I had on a white T-shirt and red shorts. Finally, Yates finished and came down in a Nike sleeveless shirt and basketball shorts.

	We decided to watch a movie. After some discussion, we settled on Anchorman 2, as we determined Robby and Matty to be mature enough to handle its humor and language. It was funny, but Carson and Cooper didn’t think it was as good as the first one. Robby and Matty didn’t understand some of it, as they had never seen the first Anchorman movie, but Yates and I both enjoyed the movie. After watching a few minutes of SportsCenter, we got bored, went outside, and played basketball in the dark. However, that only lasted a few minutes, as we couldn’t see anything out there.

	After that, we all got hungry. “I can take us in my dad’s truck down to the Subway,” Yates said. On the way there, we were mapping out the rest of the evening. “We can watch another movie,” Yates suggested. “We could play some games,” Matty offered. “We could just freakin’ sleep,” Carson growled at us, but then he laughed, and we relaxed. The workers at Subway seemed surprised to see a group of kids come in late at night, especially with Robby in his pajamas, but they were happy for the business. Everyone just ordered something small, as Yates was paying for everyone, and we didn’t want to have a full meal this late. After everyone finished, we headed back to Yates’s house. Robby fell asleep on the way back, and I had to carry him in. Since Matty and Robby’s parents weren’t coming home, we decided to just all go to sleep. Luckily, Robby didn’t have to change, and we put him down on the guest bed upstairs. Matty changed from his shorts to gray pajama pants, and slept on the floor in the guest bedroom. I changed into red lounge pants, and slept in Yates’ parents’ room, with Carson and Cooper taking the bed and me on the floor. Yates decided he would come in there with us, so he wasn’t alone. They all slept in their boxers - Carson and Yates had on matching camo boxers, and Cooper’s were plaid. We all got to sleep pretty quickly, since we were all a little worn out.

***

Will dropped us off at Ryan’s house with our bags. We were the first ones there, other than Ryan, who welcomed us in. Parker showed up next, followed by a couple kids I hadn’t seen before. We all went into the living room and sat down. “Okay, let’s all introduce ourselves. As we go around the circle, please say your name, grade, and a favorite hobby,” Ryan’s dad said. Ryan went first. “I’m Ryan Williams, I’m in 8th grade, and I like to play basketball.” “I’m Shane Stephens, 8th grade, and I like video games,” I said. “My name’s Landon Carter, 8th grade, and I like to play baseball.” “I’m Parker Fahey, in 7th grade, and I like to skateboard.” “I’m Graham Benson, I’m in 6th grade, and I like watching the Mavericks.” “My name is Freddie Jones. I’m in 6th grade, and, um, I like to go hunting.”

	Ryan’s mom had made us all dinner - turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables. After we were all finished, we took our balls and went outside. Graham had a soccer ball, Landon and Parker had baseballs, Ryan and I had basketballs, and Freddie had a tennis ball. We split into teams of 3 (Ryan and Freddie were on my team) and played soccer, then catch, then basketball. Since we didn’t have rackets, we couldn’t play actual tennis, so we just played catch again with the tennis ball. After that, we were all tired, so we went inside and sat on the couches again, then decided to play Monopoly. Freddie had never played before, and he was the first one out. Graham, Landon, and Parker went out in that order, and it was me and Ryan in the finals. I had Boardwalk and Park Place, as well as the green and yellow properties, and Ryan had everything else. We both had about 2000 dollars, but I had hotels on Boardwalk and Park Place, and Ryan landed on both of them, and I won.
	After we cleaned up the game, we had a little Bible study, then we figured out where everyone would sleep. Freddie had brought a sleeping bag, as had Landon, so they could sleep on the floor. Ryan and Graham offered to sleep on the floor, leaving the bunk bed for Parker and I. “Top bunk!” Parker yelled. We then drew numbers to see who would shower first. Landon got 1, Parker 2, Ryan 3, me 4, Freddie 5, and Graham 6. Everyone went downstairs to get their bags. Ryan only had one sleeping bag, but he let Graham use it, and he was going to sleep on the bare floor.

	Landon showered first, and took a very long time. Finally, after almost half an hour, he came out of the bathroom in some gray shorts. Parker showered quickly, and came out wearing pajama pants with guitars on them. Ryan also went quickly. He was wearing a white T-shirt and green pants. I tried to shower quickly, and since I had forgotten my pajamas, I had to just wear my underwear to sleep. Freddie went and showered, and came back in his clothes, but he took them off to sleep. Graham went last, and came back, also in his underwear. We stayed up and talked a little, but we were all a little tired, and went to sleep around nine.Embed"

That who would wear the scarlet coat shall say good-bye to fear;
Shall be a guardian of the right, a sleuth-hound of the trail--
In the little Crimson Manual there's no such word as ""fail""--
Shall follow on though heavens fall, or hell's top-turrets freeze,
Half round the world, if need there be, on bleeding hands and knees.
It's duty, duty, first and last, the Crimson Manual saith;
The Scarlet Rider makes reply: ""It's duty--to the death.""
And so they sweep the solitudes, free men from all the earth;
And so they sentinel the woods, the wilds that know their worth;
And so they scour the startled plains and mock at hurt and pain,
And read their Crimson Manual, and find their duty plain.
Knights of the lists of unrenown, born of the frontier's need,
Disdainful of the spoken word, exultant in the deed;
Unconscious heroes of the waste, proud players of the game,
Props of the power behind the throne, upholders of the name:
For thus the Great White Chief hath said, ""In all my lands be peace"",
And to maintain his word he gave his West the Scarlet Police.
Livid-lipped was the valley, still as the grave of God;
Misty shadows of mountain thinned into mists of cloud;
Corpselike and stark was the land, with a quiet that crushed and awed,
And the stars of the weird sub-arctic glimmered over its shroud.

Deep in the trench of the valley two men stationed the Post,
Seymour and Clancy the reckless, fresh from the long patrol;
Seymour, the sergeant, and Clancy--Clancy who made his boast
He could cinch like a bronco the Northland, and cling to the prongs of the Pole.

Two lone men on detachment, standing for law on the trail;
Undismayed in the vastness, wise with the wisdom of old--
Out of the night hailed a half-breed telling a pitiful tale,
""White man starving and crazy on the banks of the Nordenscold.""

Up sprang the red-haired Clancy, lean and eager of eye;
Loaded the long toboggan, strapped each dog at its post;
Whirled his lash at the leader; then, with a whoop and a cry,
Into the Great White Silence faded away like a ghost.

The clouds were a misty shadow, the hills were a shadowy mist;
Sunless, voiceless and pulseless, the day was a dream of woe;
Through the ice-rifts the river smoked and bubbled and hissed;
Behind was a trail fresh broken, in front the untrodden snow.

Ahead of the dogs ploughed Clancy, haloed by steaming breath;
Through peril of open water, through ache of insensate cold;
Up rivers wantonly winding in a land affianced to death,
Till he came to a cowering cabin on the banks of the Nordenscold.
Then Clancy loosed his revolver, and he strode through the open door;
And there was the man he sought for, crouching beside the fire;
The hair of his beard was singeing, the frost on his back was hoar,
And ever he crooned and chanted as if he never would tire:--

""I panned and I panned in the shiny sand, and I sniped on the river bar;
But I know, I know, that it's down below that the golden treasures are;
So I'll wait and wait till the floods abate, and I'll sink a shaft once more,
And I'd like to bet that I'll go home yet with a brass band playing before.""

He was nigh as thin as a sliver, and he whined like a Moose-hide cur;
So Clancy clothed him and nursed him as a mother nurses a child;
Lifted him on the toboggan, wrapped him in robes of fur,
Then with the dogs sore straining started to face the Wild.

Said the Wild, ""I will crush this Clancy, so fearless and insolent;
For him will I loose my fury, and blind and buffet and beat;
Pile up my snows to stay him; then when his strength is spent,
Leap on him from my ambush and crush him under my feet.

""Him will I ring with my silence, compass him with my cold;
Closer and closer clutch him unto mine icy breast;
Buffet him with my blizzards, deep in my snows enfold,
Claiming his life as my tribute, giving my wolves the rest.""

Clancy crawled through the vastness; o'er him the hate of the Wild;
Full on his face fell the blizzard; cheering his huskies he ran;
Fighting, fierce-hearted and tireless, snows that drifted and piled,
With ever and ever behind him singing the crazy man.
""Sing hey, sing ho, for the ice and snow,
And a heart that's ever merry;
Let us trim and square with a lover's care
(For why should a man be sorry?)
A grave deep, deep, with the moon a-peep,
A grave in the frozen mould.
Sing hey, sing ho, for the winds that blow,
And a grave deep down in the ice and snow,
A grave in the land of gold.""

Day after day of darkness, the whirl of the seething snows;
Day after day of blindness, the swoop of the stinging blast;
On through a blur of fury the swing of staggering blows;
On through a world of turmoil, empty, inane and vast.
Night with its writhing storm-whirl, night despairingly black;
Night with its hours of terror, numb and endlessly long;
Night with its weary waiting, fighting the shadows back,
And ever the crouching madman singing his crazy song.

Cold with its creeping terror, cold with its sudden clinch;
Cold so utter you wonder if 'twill ever again be warm;
Clancy grinned as he shuddered, ""Surely it isn't a cinch
Being wet-nurse to a looney in the teeth of an arctic storm.

""The blizzard passed and the dawn broke, knife-edged and crystal clear;
The sky was a blue-domed iceberg, sunshine outlawed away;
Ever by snowslide and ice-rip haunted and hovered the Fear;
Ever the Wild malignant poised and panted to slay.

The lead-dog freezes in harness--cut him out of the team!
The lung of the wheel-dog's bleeding--shoot him and let him lie!
On and on with the others--lash them until they scream!
""Pull for your lives, you devils! On! To halt is to die.""

There in the frozen vastness Clancy fought with his foes;
The ache of the stiffened fingers, the cut of the snowshoe thong;
Cheeks black-raw through the hood-flap, eyes that tingled and closed,
And ever to urge and cheer him quavered the madman's song.

Colder it grew and colder, till the last heat left the earth,
And there in the great stark stillness the bale fires glinted and gleamed,
And the Wild all around exulted and shook with a devilish mirth,
And life was far and forgotten, the ghost of a joy once dreamed.

Death! And one who defied it, a man of the Mounted Police;
Fought it there to a standstill long after hope was gone;
Grinned through his bitter anguish, fought without let or cease,
Suffering, straining, striving, stumbling, struggling on.

Till the dogs lay down in their traces, and rose and staggered and fell;
Till the eyes of him dimmed with shadows, and the trail was so hard to see;
Till the Wild howled out triumphant, and the world was a frozen hell--
Then said Constable Clancy: ""I guess that it's up to me.""

Far down the trail they saw him, and his hands they were blanched like bone;
His face was a blackened horror, from his eyelids the salt rheum ran;
His feet he was lifting strangely, as if they were made of stone,
But safe in his arms and sleeping he carried the crazy man.

So Clancy got into Barracks, and the boys made rather a scene;
And the O. C. called him a hero, and was nice as a man could be;
But Clancy gazed down his trousers at the place where his toes had been,
And then he howled like a husky, and sang in a shaky key:

""When I go back to the old love that's true to the finger-tips,
I'll say: `Here's bushels of gold, love,' and I'll kiss my girl on the lips;
It's yours to have and to hold, love.' It's the proud, proud boy I'll be,
When I go back to the old love that's waited so long for me.""Embed"
A Halo Called Fred,Minuet in F,0.856,0.48,2.0,-9.392,1.0,0.0535,0.00234,0.272,0.184,0.628,120.004,139147.0,4.0,"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County LyricsIn compliance with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon Wheeler, and inquired after my friend's friend, Leonidas W. Smiley, as requested to do, and I hereunto append the result. I have a lurking suspicion that Leonidas W. Smiley is a myth that my friend never knew such a personage; and that he on conjectured that if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him of his infamous Jim Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me to death with some exasperating reminiscence him as long and as tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design, it succeeded.

I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp Angel's, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his tranquil countenance. He roused up, and gave me good day. I told him that a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named Leonidas W. Smiley--Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, a young minister of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time resident of Angel's Camp. I added that if Mr. Wheeler could tell me anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under many obligations to him.

Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me there with his chair, and then sat down and reeled off the monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never smiled he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the gentle flowing key to which he tuned his initial sentence, he never betrayed the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm; but all through the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired its two heroes as men of transcendent genius in 'finesse.' I let him go on in his own way, and never interrupted him once.

""Rev. Leonidas W. H'm, Reverend Le--well, there was a feller here, once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49--or maybe it was the spring of '50--I don't recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one or the other is because I remember the big flume warn't finished when he first come to the camp; but anyway, he was the curiousest man about always betting on anything that turned up you ever see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he couldn't he'd change sides. Any way that suited the other man would suit him any way just so's he got a bet, he was satisfied. But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there couldn't be no solit'ry thing mentioned but that feller'd offer to bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you. If there was a horse-race, you'd find him flush or you'd find him busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a cat-fight, he'd bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight, he'd bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting, he would be there reg'lar to bet on Parson Walker, which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he was too, and a good man. If he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to get to--to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road. Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about him. Why, it never made no difference to him--he'd bet on any thing--the dangdest feller. Parson Walker's wife laid very sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn't going to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley up and asked him how she was, and he said she was considerable better--thank the Lord for his inf'nite mercy--and coming on so smart that with the blessing of Prov'dence she'd get well yet; and Smiley, before he thought, says, 'Well, I'll resk two-and-a-half she don't anyway.'

""Thish-yer Smiley had a mare--the boys called her the fifteen-minute nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because of course she was faster than that--and he used to win money on that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind. They used to give her two or three hundred yards' start, and then pass her under way; but always at the fag end of the race she get excited and desperate like, and come cavorting and straddling up, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the air, and sometimes out to one side among the fences, and kicking up m-o-r-e dust and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing and sneezing and blowing her nose--and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.

""And he had a little small bull-pup, that to look at him you'd think he warn't worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money was up on him he was a different dog; his under-jaw'd begin to stick out like the fo'castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would uncover and shine like the furnaces. And a dog might tackle him and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson--which was the name of the pup--Andrew Jackson would never let on but what he was satisfied, and hadn't expected nothing else--and the bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j'int of his hind leg and freeze to it--not chaw, you understand, but only just grip and hang on till they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that didn't have no hind legs, because they'd been sawed off in a circular saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet holt, he see in a minute how he'd been imposed on, and how the other dog had him in the door, so to speak, and he 'peared surprised, and then he looked sorter discouraged-like and didn't try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it was his fault, for putting up a dog that hadn't no hind legs for him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for hisself if he'd lived, for the stuff was in him and he had genius--I know it, because he hadn't no opportunities to speak of, and it don't stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under them circumstances if he hadn't no talent. It always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of his'n, and the way it turned out.
""Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks, and tomcats and all them kind of things, till you couldn't rest, and you couldn't fetch nothing for him to bet on but he'd match you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said he cal'lated to educate him; and so he never done nothing for three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump. And you bet you he did learn him, too. He'd give him a little punch behind, and the next minute you'd see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut--see him turn one summerset, or maybe a couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of ketching flies, and kep' him in practice so constant, that he'd nail a fly every time as fur as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog wanted was education, and he could do 'most anything--and I believe him. Why, I've seen him set Dan'l Webster down here on this floor--Dan'l Webster was the name of the frog--and sing out, 'Flies, Dan'l, flies!' and quicker'n you could wink he'd spring straight up and snake a fly off'n the counter there, and flop down on the floor ag'in as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent as if he hadn't no idea he'd been doin' any more'n any frog might do. You never see a frog so modest and straightfor'ard as he was, for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a red. Smiley was monstrous proud of his frog, and well he might be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres all said he laid over any frog that ever they see.

""Well, Smiley kep' the beast in a little lattice box, and he used to fetch him down-town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a feller --a stranger in the camp, he was--come acrost him with his box, and says:

""'What might it be that you've got in the box?'

""And Smiley says, sorter indifferent-like, 'It might be a parrot, or it might be a canary, maybe, but it ain't--it's only just a frog.'

""And the feller took it, and looked at it careful, and turned it round this way and that, and says, 'H'm--so 'tis. Well, what's HE good for.

""'Well,' Smiley says, easy and careless, 'he's good enough for one thing, I should judge--he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.

""The feller took the box again, and took another long, partiular look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'

""'Maybe you don't,' Smiley says. 'Maybe you understand frogs and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature, as it were. Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars the he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County.'

""And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad-like, 'Well, I'm only a, stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you.

""And then Smiley says, 'That's all right--that's all right if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and get you a frog.' Any so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.

""So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to himself and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail-shot-filled him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller and says:

""'Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore paws just even with Dan'l's, and I'll give the word.' Then he says, 'One-two- three--git' and him and the feller touches up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off lively but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders---so-like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted too, but he didn't have no idea what the matter was of course.

""The Teller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, 'Well,' he says, 'I don't see no pints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog.'
""Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, 'I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him --he 'pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.' And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and hefted him, and says, 'Why blame my cats if he don't weigh five pound!' and turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man --he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And--""

[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me as he moved away, he said: ""Just set where you are, stranger, and rest easy--I ain't going to be gone a second.""

But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond Jim Smiley would be likely to afford me much information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away.

At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:

""Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn't have no tail, only just a short stump like a bannanner, and--""

However, lacking both time and inclination, I did not wait to hear about the afflicted cow, but took my leave.1Embed"

A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.



Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.



The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.


McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?



Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.

McGonagall: And the boy?

Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

Albus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.



There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.



Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.



Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.



McGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are.

Dumbledore: The only family he has.



They stop outside a house.



McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.



Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.


Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.



Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.



Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.



The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:

HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE


Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.



Petunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}



A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.



Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!



Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.



Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.



Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!



A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.



Vernon: Happy birthday, son.



Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.



Petunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.

Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.



He sets to work.



Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.

Vernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!

Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.



Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.



Dudley: How many are there?

Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.

Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!

Vernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!

Dudley: I don't care how big they are!

Petunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?



Scene:

Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.



Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.

Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.



Scene:

The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.



Dudley: Make it move.

Vernon raps the glass of the cage.



Vernon: Move!



Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.



Dudley: MOVE!

Harry: He's asleep!

Dudley: He's boring.



Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.



Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.



The snake looks up and blinks.



Harry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.



The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.



Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!



Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.



Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!



Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.



Snake: Thankssssssss.

Harry: Anytime.



The snake starts off.



Man: SNAKE!



There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.



Dudley: Mum, mummy!

Petunia: {Sees him} AHH!

Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!

Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!

Harry: {Grins and giggles}



Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!



Scene:

Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.

Petunia: It's all right. It's all right.



They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.



Harry: Ow!

Vernon: What happened?

Harry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Vernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!



Scene:

Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.

Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.



Vernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

Dudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!

Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!

Vernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?



The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.



Scene:

Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.

In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.



Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.



Scene:

Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.



Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.



She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.



Vernon: Shoo! Go on!



Scene:

Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.



Scene:

Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.



Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?



Dudley shrugs.



Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---



A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.



Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}

Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}

Vernon: Go away, ahh!

Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!



Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.



Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!



He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.



Harry: Get off! Ahh!

Vernon: Ahh!

Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!

Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!



Scene:

A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.



Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}



Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.



Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!

Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}

Vernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!

Petunia: Ooh.



Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.



Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}

All: Ahh!

Hagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!

Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.

Harry appears: I-I am.

Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.

Harry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}

Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?



Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.



Harry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?

Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.

Harry: Sorry, no.

Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?

Harry: Learnt what?

Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.

Harry: I-I'm a what?

Harry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.

Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.

Dudley: {whimpers}



Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.



Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

Vernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!

Harry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?

Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

Harry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?

Petunia: We had to tell him something.

Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

Vernon: He'll not be going!

Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?

Harry: Muggle?

Hagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!

Hagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.



Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.



Dudley: Ahh!

All: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}

Harry: {laughs}

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.

Harry: {Nods} Okay.

Hagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}



Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.



Scene:

Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?

Hagrid: If you know where to go.



They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.

{Music and talking}



Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.

Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.



The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.



Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.



A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.



Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.



A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.



Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.

Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}

Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.

Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.

Harry: Good-bye.



The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.



Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!

Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}

Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.



Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.



Hagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.



Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.



Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

Hagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.



Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.



Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?

Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.



The goblin looks up.



Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}

Goblin: Very well.



Scene:

Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.



Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}



The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.



Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?



They continue on through the cavern.



Griphook: Vault 713.

Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?

Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.

Griphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}



Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside in the street, walking.



Harry: I still need...a wand.

Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.



Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.



Harry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?



There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.



Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.

Harry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}

Ollivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.

Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?

Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}

Harry: And...who owned that wand?

Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}



There is a knock on the window.



Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}

Harry: Wow.



Scene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.



Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.

Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Hagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...

Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?

Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.

Harry: Voldemort?

Hagrid: Shh!!

{Harry looks around}



A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.



Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?

Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.

Harry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?

Hagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.





Scene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.



A couple look at Hagrid.



Hagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.



Harry looks at his golden ticket.



Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}



Scene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.



Man: Sorry.

Harry sees a train master.

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.

Trainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.

Harry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?

Trainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}



A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.



Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.

Harry: Muggles?

Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.



A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.



Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.

George: He's not Fred, I am!

Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!

Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}



Harry shakes his head in disbelief.



Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to

Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.

Ginny (daughter): Good luck.



Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.



Scene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.



Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

{Ron goes agape.}

Ron: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...

Harry: The what?

Ron: {whispers} Scar...?

Harry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}

Ron: Wicked.

A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?

Ron: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}

Harry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!

Ron: Whoa!



Scene: Eating bundles of sweets.

Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.



Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?

Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!



Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.



Harry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

Ron: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.

Frog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}

Ron: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!

Ron: I got about 6 of him.

Harry: Hey, he's gone!

Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?

Harry: Just a little bit.

Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?

Harry: Yeah!

Ron: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-



A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.



Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron: No.

Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}



Scene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.



Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!



Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.



Hagrid: Hello, Harry.

Harry: Hey, Hagrid.

Ron: Whoaa!

Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.



Scene:

A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.

Ron: Wicked.



Scene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.



McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup



NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.



Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}

McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}



DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.



Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}

Harry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.



Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.



McGonagall: We're ready for you now.



She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.



Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.

McGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.



Dumbledore rises from the main table.



Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.

McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.

Hermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}

Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.

Harry nods in agreement.

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!

(Cheering)



Hermione jumps off with a smile.



McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.



Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.



Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!



Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.

McGonagall: Susan Bones.



A small, redhead goes up.

Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.



Harry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}

Ron: Harry, what is it?

Harry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.



Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!

McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.



Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.



Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!

Ron: {Sighs}

(Cheering)



McGonagall: Harry Potter.



Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.



Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?

Harry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!



There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.

Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.



McGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.

Dumbledore: Let the feast...begin.



Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.



Harry: Wow.



Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.

Ron stuffs his face.



SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.



Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

Neville laughs.



Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.



Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.

Harry: What's he teach?

Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.



Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.



Ron: Ahh!

Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.



Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.



Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Girl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!

Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?

Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}

Ron: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!

Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.

Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?

Nick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}

Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: Eugh.



Scene:

Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.



Percy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.

Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.



The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.



Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!

Ron: Look at that one, Harry!

Harry: I think she fancies you.

Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?

Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.

Girl: Who's that?



Scene:

Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.



Woman: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.

Girl: Oh, wow.

Percy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.



Scene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.





Scene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.



Ron: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?



The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.



Ron: That was bloody brilliant.

McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.

Harry: We got lost.

McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.



Scene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.



Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.



Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.



Snape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?



Scene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.



Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.



Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...

Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...



ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.



Ron: Ah. Mail's here!



The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.



Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.



Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.



Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!

Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.

Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.

Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.



Scene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.



Hooch: Good afternoon, class.

Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!

Class: Up!



Harry's broom flies into his hand.



Harry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}

Draco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}

Hooch: With feeling!

Hermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.

Ron: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}

Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}



Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.



Neville: Oh...

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.

Girl: Neville, what are you doing?

Students: Neville...Neville...

Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.

Hooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!

Harry: Neville! {shouting}

Neville: Help!!!

Hooch: Come back down this instant!

Neville: AHH!



He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.



Neville: Help!

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}

Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!

Hooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.

Girl: Is he alright?

Neville: Owowowow.

Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}

Draco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.

Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?



Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.



Hermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.



Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.



Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!

Draco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}



Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.



Boy: Good job, Harry!

Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.

McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}



Scene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.



Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient

McGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}

McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!



Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.



Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.

Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in

Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.



Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.



Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!

Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.

George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.

Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.

George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.



Scene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.



Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.

Harry: I-I didn't know.





Scene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.



Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.

Harry: Who doesn't?



The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.



Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: {Gasps.}

Harry: What's happening?

Hermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}

Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.

Ron: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?

Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.



Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.



Harry: Let's go.

{meow}

Ron: It's Filch's cat!

Harry: Run!



The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.



Harry: It's locked!

Ron: That's it, we're done for!

Hermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}

Ron: Alohomora?

Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.



Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.



Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}

Hermione: Filch is gone.

Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.

Hermione: It was locked.

Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}

All: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}



Scene:

Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.



Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.

Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}

Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.

Harry: Guarding something?

Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}

Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!

Harry nods.



Scene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.



Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?

Harry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}

Oliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}

Harry: I like this ball.

Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

Harry: What do I do with it?

Oliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}

Harry: Whoa.



Scene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.



Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.

{All practice.}

Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}

Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.



Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.



Hermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}

Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!



Seamus begins swishing at his feather.



Seamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}



BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.



Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.



Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.



Ron: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!



Hermione bustles past, sniffling.



Harry: I think she heard you.



Scene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.



Harry: Where's Hermione?

Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.

{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}



The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.



Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!

Boy: Stay together!



Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.



Scene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.



Percy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!

Harry: How could a troll get in?

Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?

Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!



The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.



Harry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!



Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.



Harry: Hermione, move!



The troll smashes the remaining stalls.



Hermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}

Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}

Hermione: Ahhh! Help!



Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.



Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}

Ron: Ew.



The troll snorts, and whips around.



Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!



The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.



Harry: Do something! {swipe}

Ron: What? {swipe}

Harry: Anything! Hurry up!



Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.



Hermione: Swish and flick!

Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.



Hermione approaches carefully.



Hermione: Is it...dead?

Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.



Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.

They all gasp.



McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!

Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...

Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}

McGonagall: Ms. Granger?

Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.

McGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....



Scene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.



Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.

Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.

Harry: I'm not hungry.



Snape appears.



Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}

Harry: That explains the blood.

Hermione: Blood?

Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.

Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?

Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

Hermione: So you're saying...

Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}

Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?

Harry: But I-I never get mail.

Ron: Let's open it.

{They open it.}

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!

Harry: But who...?

{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}



Scene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.



OIiver: Scared, Harry?

Harry: A little bit.

Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.



Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.



Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!



{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}



The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.



Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.

Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}

Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.



The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.



Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!



Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.



Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}



Harry, in the air, claps.



Harry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!



In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.



Hagrid: Well done!

Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.



Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!



Ron and Seamus: Yay!

Harry: Yes!

Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}

Gryffindors: Yay!



The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.



Flint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}



Crowd: {Booing}

Harry is visibly upset.

Slytherin laughs.



The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.



Flint: {to other members} Take that side!



They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.



Harry: Whoa! Whooa!

Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?



Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.



Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!

Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?

Hermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}



Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.



Ron: Come on, Hermione!



Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.



Hermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.



A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.



Man: Fire! You're on fire!

Snape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}



Ron: Go!

Hagrid: Go go go!



Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.



The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.



Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!



Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.



Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!

Hooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!

All: YAY!

Draco: No!

Hagrid: Yes!

Hermione: Whoo-hoo!

McGonagall: {Giggles happily}



Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.



Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!






Scene:
Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.



Hagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?

Hagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?

Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?

Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the

Harry: Yes?

Hagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.

Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!

Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.

Harry: Exactly.

Hagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

Harry: Nicholas Flamel?

Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}

Harry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?

Hermione: I don't know.



Scene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.



Harry: Knight to E-5.



A piece moves across the board.



Ron thinks for a moment.



Ron: Queen to E-5.



A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.



Hermione: That's totally barbaric!

Ron: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.

Hermione: See you haven't.

Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!

Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.

Ron: We've looked a hundred times!

Hermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}

Ron: I think we've had a bad influence on her.



Scene:

X-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.



Ron: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!



Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.



Ron: Happy Christmas, Harry.

Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?

Ron: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!

Harry: I've got presents?

Ron: Yeah!

Harry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}

Ron: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}

Harry: ""Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well.""



Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.



Ron: What is it?

Harry: Some kind of...cloak.

Ron: Well, let's see then. Put it on.



Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.



Ron: Whoa!

Harry: My body's gone!

Ron: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!

Harry: I'm invisible??

Ron: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.

Harry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, ""Use it well.""



Scene:

Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.



Harry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?



Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.



Man: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!



Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.



Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!



Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.



Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...

Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?

Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.



Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.



Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.



They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.



Harry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.



Scene:

The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.



Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

Ron: Why?

Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!



Scene:

Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.



Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!

Ron: I only see me.

Harry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad

Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}



Scene:

Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.



Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.

Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?

Dumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}



Scene:

Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.



Scene:

In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.



Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

Ron: This is light?

Hermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! ""Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!""

Ron and Harry: The what?

Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? ""The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.""

Ron: Immortal?

Hermione: It means you'll never die.

Ron: I know what it means!

Harry: Shh!

Hermione: ""The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!



They all look at each other.



Scene:

Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.



Harry: Hagrid!

Hagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}

All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!

{Door reopens.}

Hagrid: Oh.

{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?

Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.

Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!

Harry: What?

Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.

Harry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?
Hermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.

Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?

Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...

Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?

Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.



The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.



Hermione: Is that...a dragon?

Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}

Harry: Norbert?

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?

Ron: {laughs}

Hagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.



Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.



Hagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}

Harry: Malfoy.

Hagrid: Oh, dear.



Scene:

The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.



Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.

Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?

Ron: It's bad.



They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.



McGonagall: Good evening.



Malfoy appears smugly beside her.



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.



McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.

Harry: 50?!

McGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.



Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.



Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said...""the four of us.""



McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.



Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.



Scene:

Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.



Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?



Hagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.

Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.

Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.

Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!

Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}

Hagrid: Right. Let's go.



Scene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.



Harry: Hagrid, what's that?

Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

Ron: {weakly} Okay.

Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}

Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!

Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}



Scene:

Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.



Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.

Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.

Draco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.



Scene:

The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.



Harry: What is it, Fang?



Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.



Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.



Draco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!



Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.



Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

Harry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?

Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.

Harry: But who would choose such a life?

Firenze: Can you think of no one?

Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?

Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?

Harry: The Philosopher's Stone.



Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.



Hermione: Harry!

Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}

Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.

{Close up on the dead unicorn.}


Scene:

Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.



Hermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?

Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}

Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?

Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.

Ron: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!

Hermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?

{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}



Scene:

Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.



Hermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?

Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.

Hermione: It's happened before.

Harry: Not like this.

Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.

Harry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?

Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.

Harry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.

Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, ""After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem.""

Harry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

Hagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, ""The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep.""



The three gape.



Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!



Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.



Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!

McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

Harry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.

McGonagall: {shocked} How do you know

Harry: Someone's going to try and steal it.

McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}



Scene:

After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.



Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone

{Snape suddenly appears behind them}

Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?

Hermione: Uh...we were just...

Snape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Harry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.



Scene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.



Harry: Trevor.

Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!

Neville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?

Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were

Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}

Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.



Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.



Ron: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.

Harry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.

Hermione: Sorry.

Ron: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}



Scene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.



Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!

Ron: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}

Hermione: Alohomora.



The door opens and they go in.



Ron: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.

Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}

Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!

Harry: We have to move its paw.

Ron: What?!

Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?

Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.



Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.



Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}

Harry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}

Ron: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.

Harry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}

Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.

Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!



Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.



Ron and Harry: Hermione!!

Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!

Hermione's voice: Just relax!

Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!

Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.



Harry relaxes and is sucked through.



Ron: Ahh! Harry!



Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.



Ron: Harry!

Hermione: Are you okay?

Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Ron: Help!

Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?

Harry: Apparently not.

Ron: Help! Help me!

Hermione: We've got to do something!

Harry: What?

Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}

Ron: Ahhh!

Harry: Ron, are you okay?

Ron: Yeah.

Harry: Okay.

Ron: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!

Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.



There is a sound.



Hermione: What is that?

Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.



They enter into a room filled with golden ""birds.""



Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.

Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}

Hermione: What's this all about?

Harry: I don't know. Strange.

{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}

Ron: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.

Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!

Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.

Harry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}

Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?

Harry: It's too simple.

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!



Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.



Ron: This complicates things a bit!



Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.



Harry: Catch the key!



He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.



Ron: Hurry up!



The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.



Scene:

They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.



Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

Harry: Where are we? A graveyard.

Ron: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}

Harry: There's the door.



They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.



Hermione: Now what do we do?

Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}

Hermione: What happens now?

Ron: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}

Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?

Ron: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!



The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!

Ron: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.



Harry: Wait a minute.

Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.

Harry: No, Ron! No!

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!

Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!

Ron: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.



Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.



Ron: Check.



The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.



Ron: Ahhhh!

Harry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.

Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.

Harry: Not as good as you.

Hermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.



Harry nods and stands, walking away.





Scene:

Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.



Harry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one

Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, ""p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?""

Harry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.

Quirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.

Harry: Snape was trying to...save me?

Quirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.

Harry: Th-then you let the troll in.

Quirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?

{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.

Quirrell: Come here, Potter, now!



Harry walks forward shakily.



Quirrell: Tell me. What do you see?



Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.



Quirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!

Harry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.

Voldemort's voice: He lies.

Quirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.

Quirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.

Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.

Harry: Voldemort.

Voldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!



Harry turns and runs.



Voldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!

Harry: {shakes his head} Never!

Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}

Harry: You liar!

Voldemort: Kill him!



Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.



Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}

Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!

Quirrell: {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!



Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!



Voldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!

Harry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}



Scene:

The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.



Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?

Harry: Admirers?

Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.

Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?

Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.

Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

Dumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.

Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...

Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}

Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?

Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry: What is it?

Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.



Scene:

Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.



Harry: All right there, Ron?

Ron: All right? You?

Harry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?

Hermione: {smile} Never better.



Scene:

In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.

Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.

She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.



Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.



There is immense cheering.



Students: Whoo! Yeah!

Draco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}

Dumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}

Harry: {Pats} Good job.

Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}

Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!

Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.



Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.



Dumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!



Cheering.



Hagrid: Yes! {grins}



All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.



Seamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}



All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.



Lee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}



Scene:

The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.



Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.



Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.

Hermione: Come on, Harry.

Harry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}

Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.

Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.

Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}

Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.

Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.



Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.



Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.



The train whistles and they climb aboard. As the train starts to leave and the camera pans up over the whole scene, Harry waves out the window to Hagrid, who waves back and then waves more to other students as the camera pans far back, then the credits begin.2Embed"

Oh, no. This song is not about hats
This song is about something else. So fancy that!
This song is not about hats

This song is about something that has never before been defined
Can't be felt by the senses or comprehended by the mind
And so my friends, we must now ask ourselves, ""What is this song about?""
First of all, it is not about hats as was established at the opening of the song

This narrows down the possibilities slightly
Now Webster's New World Dictionary, Second College Edition defines a hat as a covering for the head. If Mr. Webster is correct (And why should we assume otherwise) then any object that can cover the head is a hat. If I put a book on my head, it would be a hat. If I put a chair on my head it would be a hat. If I put my guitar on my head, it too would be a hat

If I put your mother on my head, she would be a hat

And so, my friends, so far we have taken a very logical, very careful method of determining what the object is that is the subject of this song. As a matter of fact, we probably shouldn't be calling it an object, because if it is an object it can be put on someone's head, and if it can be put on someone's head, it might very well be considered a hat by the more observant members of society. This song must be about some kind of abstract concept. Like love. Or Democracy

But wait, my friends. Have we forgotten that not everything in life can be taken entirely literally? We simply cannot deny the existence of metaphors. Not even the bad ones

Love is a radioactive hat that causes confusion in the brain. Democracy is a protective helmet on the head of the free world. In fact the number of abstract concepts that can be metaphorically compared to hats are limitless. Metaphorically speaking, anything can be a hat

And so my friends, we do not know what this song is about. We know what it is not, but we do not know what it is. It is not a hat. It is not something else. But it does exist for in a universe as infinitely vast as our own, it must exist. But it can't be sensed or even imagined. No one will ever find it. The world will have to go on throughout all eternity never finding this amazingly wonderful object that defies all imagination, and is not a fucking hatYou might also likeEmbed"

This is what it is nigga G's up
They thought we was sleep nigga we up!

Verse
I got the most bars, all my raps high max
Take mine? Like apple...make niggas eye macs
The clips go fast like time lapse
They say like PF Changs, you never fried cats
Mad B's glued to my strip, that's a fly trap
In my car, more big screens than a IMAX
Make a bitch pull a train, like a wedding dress
Curvy like the letter S? I juice her like Everfresh
Hells angel, keep my arms out, no leather vest
Drop jewels like a blind pirate at treasure chest
Logo, black and gold wings like Goldar
Bitches peep from they car, beepin like a sonar
Its Time to eat, I'm on my grind like a molar
Night till daybreak, We hunters like Omar
The crown on my top like Corona's, and son we
Pull bitches, train em, tell em kick it like Chun Li
Heard the green stretch long like Gumby
Like earth gravity force, I am 1 G
I'm from where they heat the metal like a blacksmith
Weed in rotation like a axis, I'm atlas
World on my shoulder, and it's heavy so I'm back bitch
Straight crack like chiropractor when ya back stiff
Rap like a pissed off heavy spitter, mad slick
Hit the club, like angry chicken coups, bad chicks
Spit raw, got all these fiends at my door yeah
No Cash? Push the check in like foursquare
I reign like monsoons in Philippines Yes!
Cause I'm iLLer, thriller buzz like killer bees nest
I get wins everyday fuck hump days
In my Jump J's, watch me eat like a lunch aid
Wherever pussy goes than the ass follow
I call em failed prototypes, bad models
Yall pay em for the neck, couple gags, swallow
That's why you broke easy like a glass bottles
Iced chain stones cold as long winters
I play the rol' great like Golden Globe winners
They say I'm been losing tryna get Craig to rant
Okay C, just put up points like Kev Durant
Plain and simple like echofon, every bar top 6
I only check up on myself, like when a doc sick
My hue is green they wanna Bruce Banner me
Handle me, squares throwing shade like canopies
They get stoned, looking back like Lot's wife
Feeling cold, blowin steam like hot ice
If love is love, then muhfucka stop hating
For that paper? I got points like dot matrix
I already wrote the speech for my Grammy
They want me to flop more than the Heat in Miami
The system want us missing like a hole inside bagel
Gotta watch, Fi - O's, not Verizon cable
Ugh, Car doors on suicide watch, sickest whips
Like honey mustard, known to make the chickens dip
Y'all sliding with them ducks like Anaheim
I need a bold women, cold from Planet 9
That ass hot, God hold the branding iron
No games, no famicom, I stand for mine
I can give a buzz faster than a hard drink
Cause my punchlines is everything ya bars ain't
That's why they wanna spray my whip like car paint
Rob me, pump at the side like a car tank
I ain't heard more funny shit since Chappelle's show
It's only Philly blunts when we hold a L yo
Understand like beneath bleachers is?
The eye of the storm is calm, now let me teach you kids!

She suck me when she fuck me, I can only hears devours
Tryna talk with stuffed throat, yo mama failed cause she allowed it
Whore from in London, not the Atlanta music community
My cousin probably sold you dope
While my auntie taught you to read
Granddaddy kept a machete, my momma got her degree
My papa never bite his tongue, he unpopular when he speak
I ain't caught up in all the hoopla

And red dots that wave back for you devils
They talking levels, just trebles that trade back
If I die tomorrow, promise you hit that 1-2 wave back

Life outgrows in those suns, a late night with four nuns
Apologies but you can get the fuck if you ain't digging us
There's bigger fish to gut, around by '96

Whatever happened to good music? You know in the days when you could feel it? It was almost sexual, sending shivers up your spine. This, I believe is because songwriters were not restricted by the small music dictatorship which
Now exists. Let's hope the future holds something better than the present and let's leave the past alone. The music business is incapable of bringing music to the future, as it sits just waiting to pounce on any third rate trend, milking it to death, once again putting money where the music is not. I only wish I was born before all the great ideas were used. While I struggle to working around this, the most annoying thing is watching other people succeed through stealing them. I could have been a legend in my own time; I could
Have sold a lot of records; I could have enjoyed it as well. I could have been a lot of things. One thing that I know I am and will always be: I am the greatest

I bumped into this bloke the other day we used to know in school. We didn't say 'hello' because he had his hair slightly perked and I had all mine shaved off. I was always a bit of a clown. He used to be a hard man, but he did his homework, because he knew that one day he'd be going places. I knew I should have asked him there and then 'was he happy now that he'd finally got there?' He goes to bed thinking of ways to fiddle ten more pounds on his expenses. Me? I go to bed thinking of all the reasons why I am the greatest

We always use other people as the mirror in which we judge ourselves. So, we are constantly changing to meet their expectations. Maybe we've forgotten the meaning of the word 'individual.' It's as if everything we do or think is
Valued for its conformity. Anything fresh or original is hacked down and always brought down to size. You don't even think for yourself, as a life that is led for you is some kind of problem. You wouldn't recognize a new idea if it spat in your face and screamed out. Who am I to talk? Who the hell do I think I am? I am the greatest

Welcome to the wonderful world of show business. The dark and dank place rarely lit by the harsh light of reality. I look around and I see big mouthed rock stars with opinions on everything and answers to nothing. Burnt out old men with money to burn. Bandwagons full of bands with sycophantic fans with no lives of their own. A place where image is king and music is a poorer relation that I can relate to. I am the greatest
I am the greatest

The car had 5 shifts, 2 yawns, and 1 turn to hit their mark. Speeding recklessly, slone in the dark. But the acceleration rose, and at 4:15 they hit their mark

And tall men cried, and women wept. Cuz 4 children were driving that car. And they saw the engine on the grass, and the kids on the street...not moving anymore

Learning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment; and those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of understanding; but learning yet I do not prize it at the excessive rate that some others do, as Herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein places the sovereign good, and maintained ""That it was only in her to render us wise and contented,"" which I do not believe; no more than I do what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and that all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required a very long interpretation. My house has long-been open to men of knowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed it fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which Francis the First embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with great diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned men, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some particular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and sentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence and religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no knowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. For my part I love them well, but I do not adore them. Amongst others, Peter Bunel, a man of great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others of his sort, staid some days at Montaigne in my father's company, he presented him at his departure with a book, entitled Theologia naturalis; sive Liber Creaturarum, magistri Raimondi de Sebonde. And as the Italian and Spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this book was written in a sort of jargon of Spanish with Latin terminations, he hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it, and therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper tor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel doctrines of Luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger our ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own reason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily run into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of judging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and appearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to despise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme reverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and that some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and dispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the same uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation than the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the impressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the reverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke:

           Nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum;
           ""For with most eagerness they spurn the law,
          By which they were before most kept in awe;""
resolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first interposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent.

It happened that my father, a little before his death, having accidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers, commanded me to translate it for him into French. It is good too translate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter itself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of style are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is to turn them into a weaker idiom. It was a strange and a new undertaking for me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not being able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, I did it as well as I could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it to be printed, which after his death was done.
I found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his work well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many people take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom we owe the most service, I have often thought to assist them to clear the book of two principal objections made to it. His design is bold and daring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish and make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the Christian religion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful that I do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, I believe he has been equalled by none. This work seeming to me to be too beautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and of whom all that we know is that he was a Spaniard, practising physic at Toulouse about two hundred years ago; I enquired of Adrian Turnebus, who knew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, ""That he thought it was some abstract drawn from St. Thomas d'Aquin; for that, in truth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety, was alone capable of such thoughts."" Be this as it may, whoever was the author and inventor (and 'tis not reasonable, without greater certainty, to deprive Sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and most admirable parts.

The first thing they reprehend in his work is ""That Christians are to blame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived by faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace."" In which objection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore we are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater mildness and respect. This were a task more proper for a man well read in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, I conceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending all human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased the bounty of God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should moreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and privilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. And I do not believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it: for, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly furnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed, by their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. 'Tis faith alone that livelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion; but, withal, I do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable attempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which God has endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but that it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not a design in a Christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end of all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. We do not satisfy ourselves with serving God with our souls and understandings only, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our limbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here do the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but always with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that it depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so supernatural and divine a knowledge. If it enters not into us by an extraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover, by human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and yet, I am afraid, we only have it by this way.

If we hold upon God by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon God by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation, human occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our fortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty, the constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and fortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger and alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every new argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should withstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding constancy:

                As a great rock repels the rolling tides,

            That foam and bark about her marble sides,
           From its strong bulk
If we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear throughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry its brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen illuminated with this noble light. We ought to be ashamed that, in all the human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in some measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine and heavenly an institution does only distinguish Christians by the name! Will you see the proof of this? Compare our manners to those of a Mahometan or Pagan, you will still find that we fall very

short; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of our religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond all others: and that it should be said of us, ""Are they so just, so charitable, so good: Then they are Christians."" All other signs are common to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance,

martyrs. The peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it is also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product of truth. For this our good St. Louis was in the right, who, when the Tartar king, who was become Christian, designed to come to Lyons to kiss the Pope's feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped to find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for fear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put him out of conceit with so holy a belief! And yet it happened quite otherwise since to that other, who, going to Rome, to the same end, and there seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time, settled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering how great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could maintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so vicious hands. If we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove mountains from their places, saith the sacred Word; our actions, that would then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be merely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well as our belief: Brevis est institutio vit honest beauque, si credos. ""Believe, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one."" Some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not; others, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not being able to penetrate into what it is to believe. We think it strange if, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see events float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is because we bring nothing to it but our own. Justice, which is in one party, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed, pretended, but 'tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is there, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection of the party. God owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and religion; not to our passions. Men there are the conductors, and therein serve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary. Observe, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and draw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so direct and firm. When and where was this more manifest than in France in our days? They who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken it on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike employ it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with a progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the diversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the conduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. Did one ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more united, and more the same? Do but observe with what horrid impudence we toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both rejected and retaken them, accord—as fortune has shifted our places in these intestine storms.

This so solemn proposition, ""Whether it be lawful for a subject to rebel and take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,"" do you remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it was the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? And hearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the one and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause than for that. We condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be made to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does France than say it? Let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the army, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure zeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of their country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out of both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d'armes. Whence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have maintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions, and that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run full speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their violent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness, and slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual considerations, according to the variety wherein they move?

I evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other offices but those that least suit with our own passions.

There hostility so admirable as the Christian. Our zeal performs wonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition, avarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair, towards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some rare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor toot. Our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens, nourishes, and incites them. We must not mock God. If we believed in him, I do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say (and I speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised him as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions, we should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and beauty that shines in him;—at least, he would go equal in our affection with riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. The best of us is not so much afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his kinsman, or his master. Is there any understanding so weak that, having on one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other (in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory, would change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out of mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps, the very desire to offend. The philosopher Antisthenes, as he was being initiated in the mysteries of Orpheus, the priest telling him, ""That those who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive perfect and eternal felicity after death,""—""If thou believest that,"" answered he, ""why dost thou not die thyself?"" Diogenes, more rudely, according to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest that in like manner preached to him, ""To become of his religion, that he might obtain the happiness of the other world;—""What!"" said he, ""thou wouldest have me to believe that Agesilaus and Epaminondas, who were so great men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and canst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?"" Did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same reverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should not have death in so great horror:

          Non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur;
          Sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais,
         Gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus.
          ""We should not on a death bed grieve to be
           Dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully
          From our old hut, and with the snake, be glad
           To cast off the corrupted slough we had;
          Or with th' old stag rejoice to be now clear
           From the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear.""
""I desire to be dissolved,"" we should say, ""and to be with Jesus Christ"" The force of Plato's arguments concerning the immortality of the soul set some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the sooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for.

All this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion after our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other religions are received. Either we are happened in the country where it is in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority of the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates against misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. These considerations ought, 'tis true, to be applied to our belief but as subsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. Another religion, other witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way, imprint a quite contrary belief. We are Christians by the same title that we are Perigordians or Germans. And what Plato says, ""That there are few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will not reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,"" does not concern a true Christian: 'tis for mortal and human religions to be received by human recommendation. What kind of faith can that be that cowardice and want of courage establish in us? A pleasant faith, that does not believe what it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! Can a vicious passion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product in our souls? ""They are confident in their judgment,"" says he, ""that what is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion of making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases bring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror of that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!"" And by reason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his Laws all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything of ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when they happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. They say of Bion that, infected with the atheism of Theodoras, he had long had religious men in great scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave himself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and returned according to the necessities of Bion. Plato and these examples would conclude that we are brought to a belief of God either by reason or by force. Atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous, difficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how arrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to be the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly to affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have, nevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. Yet will they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give them a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness has abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will easily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled to the public faith and examples. A doctrine seriously digested is one thing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from the disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great uncertainty in the fancy. Miserable and senseless men, who strive to be worse than they can!

The error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this great soul of Plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into this other mistake, ""That children and old men were most susceptible of religion,"" as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness. The knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to restrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that derives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our reasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint, having but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority of God and his divine grace. Now the heart and soul being governed and commanded by faith, 'tis but reason that they should muster all our other faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service and assistance of their design. Neither is it to be imagined that all this machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the mighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world some image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and formed them. He has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his divinity, and 'tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning it. 'Tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, ""That he manifests his invisible operations to us by those that are visible."" Sebond applied himself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that there is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates from its maker. It were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the universe consent to our belief. The heavens, the earth, the elements, our bodies and our souls,—all things concur to this; we have but to find out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable of instruction. For this world is a sacred temple, into which man is introduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal hand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the sun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are intelligible to us. ""The invisible tilings of God,"" says St. Paul, ""appear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity being considered by his works.""

          And God himself envies not men the grace
          Of seeing and admiring heaven's face;
           But, rolling it about, he still anew
           Presents its varied splendour to our view,
          And on oar minds himself inculcates, so
           That we th' Almighty mover well may know:
         Instructing us by seeing him the cause
            Of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws.""
Now our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested matter. The grace of God is the form; 'tis that which gives fashion and value to it. As the virtuous actions of Socrates and Cato remain vain and fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true creator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses; they have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and without light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. Faith coming to tinct and illustrate Sehond's arguments renders them firm and stolid; and to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and of being the first guides to an elementary Christian to put him into the way of this knowledge. They in some measure form him to, and render him capable of, the grace of God, by which means he afterwards completes and perfects himself in the true belief. I know a man of authority, bred up to letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the errors of unbelief by Sebond's arguments. And should they be stripped of this ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith, and be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are precipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irrligion, they will even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same quality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to say to our opponents:

           Si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer:

               ""If you have arguments more fit.
            Produce them, or to these submit.""
let them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others, and upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. I am, unawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which I proposed to make answer in the behalf of Sebond. Some say that his arguments are weak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great ease to confute them. These are to be a little more roughly handled, for they are more dangerous and malicious than the first Men willingly wrest the sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. To an atheist all writings tend to atheism: he corrupts the most innocent matter with his own venom. These have their judgments so prepossessed that they cannot relish Sebond's reasons. As to the rest, they think we give them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting our religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of authority and command, they durst not attack. The means that I shall use, and that I think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and spurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of the inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms of their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the ground under the authority and reverence of the Divine Majesty. 'Tis to that alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make a true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value ourselves upon: [—Greek—] ""God permits not any being but himself to be truly wise."" Let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the tyranny of the evil spirit Deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem dal gratiam. ""God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."" ""Understanding is in the gods,"" says Plato, ""and not at all, or very little, in men."" Now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a Christian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our holy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their own mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or more firmly adjusted. Let us see, then, if man has in his power other more forcible and convincing reasons than those of Sebond; that is to say, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason. For St. Augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to reproach them with injustice, ""In that they maintain the part of our belief to be false that our reason cannot establish."" And to show that a great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could not sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and undoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he does, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition. We must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the weakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon examples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no faculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all one; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its authority and reject its mediation.
What does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy, when she so often inculcates to us, ""That our wisdom is but folly in the sight of God: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who presumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man, who is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and deceive himself."" These sentences of the Holy Spirit do so clearly and vividly express that which I would maintain that I should need no other proof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to his authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will not suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself.

Let us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance, armed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace and wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his being. Let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. Let him make me understand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has built those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. Who has made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch, the eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head, the wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be established and continue so many ages for his service and convenience? Can any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and wretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject to the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of the world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less to command the whole? And the privilege which he attributes to himself of being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding to discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can return thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and disbursements of the world; who, I wonder, sealed him this patent? Let us see his commission for this great employment Was it granted in favour of the wise only? Few people will be concerned in it. Are fools and wicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst part of the world, to be preferred before the rest? Shall we believe this man?—""For whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world was made? For theirs who have the use of reason: these are gods and men, than whom certainly nothing can be better:"" we can never sufficiently decry the impudence of this conjunction. But, wretched creature, what has he in himself worthy of such an advantage? Considering the incorruptible existence of the celestial bodies; beauty; magnitude, and continual revolution by so exact a rule;

                   Cum suspicimus mni clestia mundi
            Templa super, stellisque micantibus arthera fiium,
            El venit in mcntem lun solisque viarurn.

                  ""When we the heavenly arch above behold.
            And the vast sky adorned with stars of gold.
            And mark the r'eglar course? that the sun
            And moon in their alternate progress run.""

considering the dominion and influence those bodies have, not only over our lives and fortunes;

           Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab aatris;

           ""Men's lives and actions on the stars depend.""
but even over our inclinations, our thoughts and wills, which they govern, incite and agitate at the mercy of their influences, as our reason teaches us;

                ""Contemplating the stars he finds that they
          Rule by a secret and a silent sway;
           And that the enamell'd spheres which roll above
           Do ever by alternate causes move.
           And, studying these, he can also foresee,
           By certain signs, the turns of destiny;""
seeing that not only a man, not only kings, but that monarchies, empires, and all this lower world follow the influence of the celestial motions,

                 ""How great a change a little motion brings!
            So great this kingdom is that governs kings:""
if our virtue, our vices, our knowledge, and this very discourse we are upon of the power of the stars, and the comparison we are making betwixt them and us, proceed, as our reason supposes, from their favour;

                  ""One mad in love may cross the raging main,
           To level lofty Ilium with the plain;
           Another's fate inclines him more by far
           To study laws and statutes for the bar.
           Sons kill their father, fathers kill their sons,
          And one arm'd brother 'gainst another runs..
           This war's not their's, but fate's, that spurs them on
         To shed the blood which, shed, they must bemoan;
           And I ascribe it to the will of fate
           That on this theme I now expatiate:""
if we derive this little portion of reason we have from the bounty of heaven, how is it possible that reason should ever make us equal to it? How subject its essence and condition to our knowledge?
Whatever we see in those bodies astonishes us: Qu molitio, qua ferramenta, qui vectes, qu machina, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt? ""What contrivance, what tools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous a work?"" Why do we deprive them of soul, of life, and discourse? Have we discovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who have no commerce with them but by obedience? Shall we say that we have discovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul? What! have we seen any thing like the sun? Does he cease to be, because we have seen nothing like him? And do his motions cease, because there are no other like them? If what we have not seen is not, our knowledge is marvellously contracted: Qu sunt tant animi angusti! ""How narrow are our understandings!"" Are they not dreams of human vanity, to make the moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as Anaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant colonies for our convenience, as Plato and Plutarch have done? And of our earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? ""Amongst the other inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the understanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of erring, but from a love of error.
The corruptible body stupifies the soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the imagination.""

Presumption is our natural and original disease. The most wretched and frail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. He feels and sees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and rivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest story of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals of the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be placing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens under his feet. 'Tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals himself to God, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and separates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the shares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to them portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit How does he know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal motions of animals?—from what comparison betwixt them and us does he conclude the stupidity he attributes to them? When I play with my cat who knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me? We mutually divert one another with our play. If I have my hour to begin or to refus, she also has hers. Plato, in his picture of the golden age under Saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had, his communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself, he knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he acquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life more happily than we could do. Need we a better proof to condemn human impudence in the concern of beasts? This great author was of opinion that nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had only regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his time. The defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may it not be in our part as well as theirs? 'Tis yet to determine where the fault lies that we understand not one another,—for we understand them no more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be beasts as we think them. 'Tis no great wonder if we understand not them, when we do not understand a Basque or a Troglodyte. And yet some have boasted that they understood them, as Apollonius Tyanaus, Melampus, Tiresias, Thales, and others. And seeing, as cusmographers report, that there are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity be able to interpret his voice and motions. We must observe the parity betwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so have beasts of ours,—much about the same. They caress us, threaten us, and beg of us, and we do the same to them.

As to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and absolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly understand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds:

              ""The tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes.
          Though we of higher race conclude them mutes.
          Yet utter dissonant and various notes,
          From gentler lungs or more distended throats,
           As fear, or grief, or anger, do them move,
          Or as they do approach the joys of love.""
In one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of another sort of bark he is not afraid. Even in the very beasts that have no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices we observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very motions discover it:

                ""As infants who, for want of words, devise
            Expressive motions with their hands and eyes.""
And why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell stories by signs? Of whom I have seen some, by practice, so clever and active that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection of making themselves understood. Lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat, thank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their eyes:

               ""Even silence in a lover
          Love and passion can discover.""
What with the hands? We require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, pray, supplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, admire, number, confess, repent, fear, express confusion, doubt, instruct, command, incite, encourage, swear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, abuse, despise, defy, provoke, flatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt, entertain, congratulate, complain, grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and what not! And all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating speech.
With the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the lie, welcome, honour, reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject, caress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire.
What with the eyebrows?—what with the shoulders! There is not a motion that does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline, and a public language that every one understands: whence it should follow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that these should rather be judged the property of human nature. I omit what necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in need;—the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the sciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations that Pliny reports have no other language. An ambassador of the city of Abdera, after a long conference with Agis, King of Sparta, demanded of him, ""Well, sir, what answer must I return to my fellow-citizens?"" ""That I have given thee leave,"" said he, ""to say what thou wouldest, and as much as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word."" is not this a silent speaking, and very easy to be understood?

As to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations of animals? Is there a polity better ordered, the offices better distributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that of bees? Can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of employments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation?

              ""Hence to the bee some sages have assign'd
           Some portion of the god and heavenly wind.""
The swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the corners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build their nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose out the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? And in that elegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather make choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a right angle, without knowing their properties and effects? Do they bring water, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter grows softer by being wetted? Do they mat their palace with moss or down without foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy? Do they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their lodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of the winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another? Why does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in another; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not deliberation, thought, and conclusion? We sufficiently discover in most of their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to imitate them. We see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we employ all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why do we not conclude the same of them?

Why should we attribute to I know not what natural and servile inclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art? wherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us in making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn them, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of their life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out by art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same time denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of understanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that their brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our divine intelligence can do. Really, at this rate, we might with great reason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity is not so irregular and unformed.

Nature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not one she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the conservation of its being. For the common complaints I hear men make (as the license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds, and then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only animal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having wherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas nature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks, bark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk, according to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons, teeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught them that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and sing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing but weep, without teaching;

               ""Like to the wretched mariner, when toss'd
         By raging seas upon the desert coast,
          The tender babe lies naked on the earth,
         Of all supports of life stript by his birth;
         When nature first presents him to the day,
         Freed from the cell wherein before he lay,
           He fills the ambient air with doleful cries.
          Foretelling thus life's future miseries;
            But beasts, both wild and tame, greater and less,
           Do of themselves in strength and bulk increase;
            They need no rattle, nor the broken chat,
            Ay which the nurse first teaches boys to prate
            They look not out for different robes to wear,
            According to the seasons of the year;
           And need no arms nor walls their goods to save,
            Since earth and liberal nature ever have,
          And will, in all abundance, still produce
         All things whereof they can have need or use:""
these complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a greater equality and more uniform relation. Our skins are as sufficient to defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness several nations that yet know not the use of clothes. Our ancient Gauls were but slenderly clad, any more than the Irish, our neighbours, though in so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for all those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very able to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head, according to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us, and that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach where the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always open, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes half-bare as low as the navel. Neither is the binding or swathing of infants any more necessary; and the Lacedmoman mothers brought theirs in all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. Our crying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are but few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves a long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a behaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. As to the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without instruction;

""For every one soon finds his natural force.
Which he, or better may employ, or worse.""
Who doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself, may make shift to find something to eat And the earth produces and offers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture and artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts, witness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against the dead seasons of the year. The late discovered nations, so abundantly furnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery, may give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that, without tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all we stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she does at present, now that we have added our own industry:

                 ""The earth did first spontaneously afford
           Choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board;
           With herbs and flow'rs unsown in verdant fields.
          But scarce by art so good a harvest yields;
            Though men and oxen mutually have strove,
           With all their utmost force the soil t' improve,""
the debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the inventions we can contrive to satisfy it.

As to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more various motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more service from them. Those that are trained to fight naked are seen to throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. If some beasts surpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. And the industry of fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by instinct and natural precept? That it is so, the elephant shows who sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has particular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs them at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and throw the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon, when he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body, and covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered slime, as with a cuirass. Why shall we not say that it is also natural for us to arm ourselves with wood and iron?

As to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not necessary. Nevertheless I believe that a child which had been brought up in an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would be an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to express his meaning by. And 'tis not to be supposed that nature should have denied that to us which she has given to several other animals: for what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing, calling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love, which they do with the voice, other than speech? And why should they not speak to one another? They speak to us, and we to them. In how many several sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us? We converse with them in another sort of language, and use other appellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the idiom according to the kind.

                ""Thus from one swarm of ants some sally out.
           To spy another's stock or mark its rout.""
Lactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter also. And the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according to the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the same kind. Aristotle, in proof of this, instances the Various calls of partridges, according to the situation of places:

                 ""And various birds do from their warbling throats
          At various times, utter quite different notes,
          And some their hoarse songs with the seasons change.""
But it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of that what is said by guess has no great appearance. If a man will allege to me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf speak not, I answer that this is not only because they could not receive the instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of hearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and that these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such manner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and make it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others.

All this I have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things, and to bring us back and join us to the crowd. We are neither above nor below the rest All that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and one fortune:

               ""All things remain
          Bound and entangled in one fatal chain.""
There is, indeed, some difference,—there are several orders and degrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature:

              ""All things by their own rites proceed, and draw
         Towards their ends, by nature's certain law.""
Man must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity. Miserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the rail. He is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same necessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of a very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real pre-eminence. That which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and opinion, has neither body nor taste. And if it be so, that he only, of all the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of thoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that he would have, the false and the true, 'tis an advantage dearly bought, and of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs the principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal him,—sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. I say, then, to return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to believe that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the same things that we do by our choice and industry. We ought from like effects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater faculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the same ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have others that are better. Why should we imagine this natural constraint in them, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more honourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and inevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act regularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to entrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our own. The vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our sufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the other animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour, in order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very foolishly in my opinion; for I should as much value parts and virtues naturally and purely my own as those I had begged and obtained from education. It is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to be favoured of God and nature.

For instance, take the fox, the people of Thrace make use of when they wish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before them to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of the river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer distance he can hear the noise of the waters' current, and, according as he finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire or advance,—have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational thoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like occasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from natural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs is not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid yields to impression! For to attribute this to a mere quickness of the sense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chimra that cannot enter into the imagination. We are to suppose the same of the many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure themselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them.

And if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power to seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our pleasure, 'tis still but the same advantage we have over one another.
We have our slaves upon these terms: the Climacid, were they not women in Syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by which the ladies mounted their coaches? And the greatest part of free persons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being into the power of another.
The wives and concubines of the Thracians contended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband's tomb. Have tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion? some of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in death as well as life? Whole armies have bound themselves after this manner to their captains. The form of the oath in the rude school of gladiators was in these words: ""We swear to suffer ourselves to be chained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all that true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both body and soul in his service.""

                 Uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro
           Corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca.

                ""Wound me with steel, or burn my head with fire.
            Or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire.""
This was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand entered into it, to their destruction. When the Scythians interred their king they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines, his cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of his chamber, and his cook. And upon the anniversary thereof they killed fifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the spine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph about his tomb. The men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less careful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and dogs withal. To what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of these? I do not think that servants of the most abject condition would willingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to do for their beasts. Diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem, him from servitude: ""They are fools,"" said he; ""'tis he that keeps and nourishes me that in reality serves me."" And they who entertain beasts ought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. And withal in this these have something more generous in that one lion never submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of courage. As we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to the chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon hares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks upon blackbirds and larks:

                ""The stork with snakes and lizards from the wood
            And pathless wilds supports her callow brood,
           While Jove's own eagle, bird of noble blood,
          Scours the wide country for undaunted food;
            Sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away,
           And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey.""
We divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with our hawks and hounds. And about Amphipolis, in Thrace, the hawkers and wild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. As also along the lake Motis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal share of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in pieces. And as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by subtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook, there is also the like amongst other animals. Aristotle says that the cuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she extends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little fish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying herself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it in, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch it.

As to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many injuries as man. We need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any such-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great number of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate Sylla's dictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor is the breakfast of a little contemptible worm!

Why should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by art and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and proper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know the virtues of rhubarb and polypody. When we see the goats of Candia, when wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out dittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper, immediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub and clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters of sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies, and those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters too (witness the elephant of King Porus whom Alexander defeated), the darts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously that we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the patient;—why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason? For to allege, to their disparagement, that 'tis by the sole instruction and dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them the dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute it to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress. Chrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition of animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of a dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after his master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before him, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and, after having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of what he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to confess that this reasoning is in the dog: ""I have traced my master to this place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is not gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;"" and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his nose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers himself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. This sally, purely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and the right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the dog knows all this of himself as well as from Trapezuntius?

Animals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our method. We teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and the facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both them and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined within a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they have a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn. Everybody, I believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that tumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one cadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps they make them perform by the command of a word. But I observe this effect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common, in the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: I have taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont to receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even there where they have sufficient room to pass; I have seen them, by the trench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only to keep their masters further from the ditch;—how could a man have made this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master's safely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? And how had he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so for a blind man? Can all this be apprehended without ratiocination!

I must not omit what Plutarch says he saw of a dog at Rome with the Emperor Vespasian, the father, at the theatre of Marcellus. This dog served a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages, and had therein his part. He had, amongst other things, to counterfeit himself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed to eat After he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the drug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken giddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered himself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part to do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently to stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head looked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators.
The oxen that served in the royal gardens of Susa, to water them, and turn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which buckets were fastened (such as there are many in Languedoc), being ordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed to this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one turn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and stand still. We are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have lately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all.

There is more understanding required in the teaching of' others than in being taught. Now, setting aside what Democritus held and proved, ""That most of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,"" as by the spider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and nightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:—Aristotle is of opinion ""That the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and spend a great deal of time and care in it;"" whence it happens that those we bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their parents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this that they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild, it is not all and every one alike—every one has learnt to do better or worse, according to their capacity. And so jealous are they one of another, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by so vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the place, the breath rather failing than the voice. The younger ruminate pensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens to the master's lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they are silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some reprehensions of the teacher. "" have formerly seen,"" says Arrian, ""an elephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his trunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him, rising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by the instrument; and 'twas delightful to hear this harmony."" In the spectacles of Rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move and dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes and cadences very hard to learn. And some have been known so intent upon their lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might not be chidden nor beaten by their masters.
But this other story of the pie, of which we have Plutarch himself for a warrant, is very strange. She lived in a barber's shop at Rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. It happened one day that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the shop. After that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and melancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the trumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was gone with her hearing. But they found at last that it was a profound meditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and preparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the first voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops, and changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all she had learned before.

I will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same Plutarch (I am sadly confounding all order, but I do not propose arrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which Plutarch says he saw on board a ship. This dog being puzzled how to get the oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with his tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched stones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high that he could reach it.
What is this but an effect of a very subtle capacity! 'Tis said that the ravens of Barbary do the same, when the water they would drink is too low. This action is somewhat akin to what Juba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: ""That when, by the craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits prepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the rest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to raise the bottom so that he may get out."" But this animal, in several other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should I particularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, I should easily have what I usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more difference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and such a man. The keeper of an elephant in a private house of Syria robbed him every meal of the half of his allowance.
One day his master would himself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered for his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry look at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the other, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him.
And another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make up the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own dinner, and filled it with ashes. These are particular effects: but that which all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the armies of the Levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants, with whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we now do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in a day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in ancient history);

                  ""The sires of these huge animals were wont
          The Carthaginian Hannibal to mount;
          Our leaders also did these beasts bestride,
           And mounted thus Pyrrhus his foes defied;
           Nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear
         Castles with armed cohorts to the war.""
They must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and understanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard of a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of the bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should have made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to spoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that they have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break into our own battalions and rout one another. They had the charge not of one simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in the battle: as the Spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of the Indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil; and those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the victory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion required; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as they did ardour and fierceness.

We more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those of ordinary observation. I had not else so long insisted upon these examples: for I believe whoever shall strictly observe what we ordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as wonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. 'Tis one and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has sufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly conclude as to both the future ana the past. I have formerly seen men, brought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not being understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit, being quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages and brutes! Who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common sense to see them mute, ignorant of the French tongue, ignorant of our salutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human nature must by all means take its pattern and example. All that seems strange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. The same thing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. They have several conditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some conjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves, what know we what to make of them! The horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds, and most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and suffer themselves to be governed by them: so did Crassus's lamprey, and came when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the Lake Arethusa; and I have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at a certain call of those who use to feed them.

              ""They every one have names, and one and all
         Straightway appear at their own master's call:""
We may judge of that. We may also say that the elephants have some participation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and purifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms, and, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in meditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their own motion; without instruction or precept But because we do not see any such signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are without religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. As we discern something in this action which the philosopher Cleanthes took notice of, because it something resembles our own. He saw, he says, ""Ants go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards another ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if to speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last returned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so made two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation. In the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their burrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid upon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others."" This was the interpretation that Cleanthes gave of this transaction, giving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice are not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication, whereof 'tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for that reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. But they yet produce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far from being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by imitation conceive it. Many are of opinion that in the great and last naval engagement that Antony lost to Augustus, his admiral galley was stayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the Latins call remora, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of vessels to which she fastens herself. And the Emperor Caligula, sailing with a great navy upon the coast of Romania, his galley only was suddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened as it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal could resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by being only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish); and was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being brought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had without. A citizen of Cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good mathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his burrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the wind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen observing, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was presently to blow. The camlon takes her colour from the place upon which she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases, according to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or from what he has a design to seize: in the camlon 'tis a passive, but in the polypus 'tis an active, change. We have some changes of colour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our complexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the camlon. It is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow, but 'tis not in the power of our own will. Now these effects that we discover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some more excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as 'tis to be presumed there are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no appearances have arrived at us.

Amongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the most certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing certain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. That rule and order of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of future things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to so noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural disposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by whom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. That it is so, the cramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that touch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the hands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that if one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the water to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. This is a miraculous force; but 'tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it, and makes use on't; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury herself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and benumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. Cranes, swallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according to the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their divining faculty, and put it in use. Huntsmen assure us that to cull out from amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as the best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus, take them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings back will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would environ the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. By which it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or that they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more certain than we have.

The manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting, moving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we retrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above theirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason. For the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of the beasts' manners and way of living; for this saying (out of Plutarch) has in all times been in the mouth of these people: ""Keep warm thy feet and head, as to the rest, live like a beast.""

The chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain disposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end; nevertheless, we are ordered by Lucretius to conform to the gesture and posture of the brutes as the most effectual:—

                More ferarum,
         Quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur
          Concipere uxores:
           Quia sic loca sumere possunt,
           Pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis;
and the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and impudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to whom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of the beasts of their own sex:—

                 Nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque rpugnt,
           Clunibus ipsa viri Venerem si lta retractet,
           Atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua.
           Ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque
          Vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum.
If it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that serve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon strangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air of our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the distribution of what they have to their young. And as to friendship, they have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have. King Lysimachus's dog, Hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed, obstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his body was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was consumed, As also did the dog of one Pyrrhus, for he would not stir from off his master's bed from the time he died; and when they carried him away let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile where they burnt his master's body. There are inclinations of affection which sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by a fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts are as capable as we. We see horses take such an acquaintance with one another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when separated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of their own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and demonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some other colour. Animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and cull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies and implacable malice.

Desires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or natural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither natural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of men; they are all superfluous and artificial. For 'tis marvellous how little will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our ragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. The Stoics say that a man may live on an olive a day. The delicacy of our wines is no part of her instruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our amorous appetites:—

                  Neque ilia
            Magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum.

                 ""Nature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims
           The pride of titles, and the pomp of names.""
These irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion have infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the natural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the city as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their ancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and introduce new laws and customs of their own. Animals are much more regular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the limits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not sometimes an analogy with our debauches. And as there have been furious desires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been examples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized with monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was rival to Aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench in the city of Alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices of a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they sold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her. He would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would sometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel her breasts. They tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a goose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless Glaucia, in the town of Asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons furiously in love with women. We see also certain male animals that are fond of the males of their own kind. Oppian and others give us some examples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their copulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:—

                  Nec habetur turpe juvenc
           Ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux;
           Quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus
            Semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales.

                ""The heifer thinks it not a shame to take
          Her lusty sire upon her willing back:
           The horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not
           T' increase the herd by those they have begot;
         And birds of all sorts do in common live,
         And by the seed they have conceived conceive.""
And for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the philosopher Thales's mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and by accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet, perceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something lighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down with his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he should be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased to practise that device. There are several that very vividly represent the true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to get all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though they never make any use of it at all. As to thrift, they surpass us not only in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come, but they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto. The ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh and dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they should decay and rot. But the caution and prevention they use in gnawing their grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by reason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows soft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting to germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and property of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by which it should shoot and sprout.

As to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of human actions, I would very fain know whether we would use it for an argument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our weakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and killing one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has nothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it not.

                  Quando leoni Fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam
           Expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?

                 ""No lion drinks a weaker lion's gore,
            No boar expires beneath a stronger boar.""
Yet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of bees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:—

            Spe duobus Regibus incessit magno discordia motu;
           Continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello
           Gorda licet long prsciscere.

                 ""But if contending factions arm the hive,
           When rival kings in doubtful battle strive,
           Tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare,
           And palpitating hearts that beat to war.""
I never read this divine description but that, methinks, I there see human folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. For these warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise and horror, this rattle of guns, drums, and cries,

               Fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum
           re renidescit tellus, subterque virm vi
            Excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes
            Icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;

                 ""When burnish'd arms to heaven dart their rays,
            And many a steely beam i' th' sunlight plays,
           When trampled is the earth by horse and man,
          Until the very centre groans again,
           And that the rocks, struck by the various cries,
          Reverberate the sound unto the skies;""
in the dreadful embattling of so many thousands of armed men, and so great fury, ardour, and courage, 'tis pleasant to consider by what idle occasions they are excited, and by how light ones appeased:—

                 Paridis propter narratur amorem
           Greci Barbari diro collisa duello:

                ""Of wanton Paris the illicit love
            Did Greece and Troy to ten years' warfare move:""
all Asia was ruined and destroyed for the lust of Paris; the envy of one single man, a despite, a pleasure, a domestic jealousy, causes that ought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all this mighty bustle. Shall we believe those very men who are themselves the principal authors of these mischiefs? Let us then hear the greatest, the most powerful, the most victorious emperor that ever was, turning into a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles fought both by sea and land, the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men that followed his fortune, and the strength and riches of two parts of the world drained for the expense of his expeditions:—

                 Quod futuit Glaphyran Antonius, hanc mihi poenam
           Fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam.
           Fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me Manius oret
           Podicem, faciam? Non puto, si sapiam.
          Aut futue, aut pugnemus, ait
           Quid, si mihi vitii
          Charior est ips mentula? Signa canant.

                  Qui? moi, que je serve Fulvie!
          Sufflt-il quelle en ait envie?
           A ce compte, on verrait se retirer von moi
           Mille pouses mal satisfaites.
         Aime-moi, me dit elle, ou combattons. Mais quoi?
           Elle est bien laide! Allons, sonnes trompettes.

           'Cause Anthony is fired with Glaphire's charms
          Fain would his Fulvia tempt me to her arms.
          If Anthony be false, what then? must I
           Be slave to Fulvia's lustful tyranny?
            Then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives,
(I use my Latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow me.) Now this great body, with so many fronts, and so many motions, which seems to threaten heaven and earth:—

                Quam multi Lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus,
           Svus ubi Orion hibemis conditur undis,
            Vel quam solo novo dens torrentur Arist,
            Aut Hermi campo, aut Lyci flaventibus arvis;
           Scuta sonant, pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus:

                   ""Not thicker billows beat the Lybian main,
            When pale Orion sits in wintry rain;
           Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,
          Or Lycian fields, when Phobus burns the skies,
           Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;
           Their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground:""
this furious monster, with so many heads and arms, is yet man—feeble, calamitous, and miserable man! 'Tis but an ant-hill disturbed and provoked:—

         It nigrum campis agmen:

         ""The black troop marches to the field:""
a contrary blast, the croaking of a flight of ravens, the stumble of a horse, the casual passage of an eagle, a dream, a voice, a sign, a morning mist, are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn him. Dart but a sunbeam in his face, he is melted and vanished. Blow but a little dust in his eyes, as our poet says of the bees, and all our ensigns and legions, with the great Pompey himself at the head of them, are routed and crushed to pieces; for it was he, as I take it, that Sertorious beat in Spain with those fine arms, which also served Eumenes against Antigonus, and Surena against Crassus:—

                 ""Swarm to my bed like bees into their hives.
          Declare for love, or war, she said; and frown'd:
          No love I'll grant: to arms bid trumpets sound.""
                 Hi motus animorum, atque hoc certamina tanta,
          Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent.

                ""Yet at thy will these dreadful conflicts cease,
            Throw but a little dust and all is peace.""
Let us but slip our flies after them, and they will have the force and courage to defeat them. Of fresh memory, the Portuguese having besieged the city of Tamly, in the territory of Xiatine, the inhabitants of the place brought a great many hives, of which are great plenty in that place, upon the wall; and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the enemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their attacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort of relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune, that at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they had not lost so much as one. The souls of emperors and cobblers are cast in the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes considered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as weighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed on, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are in our little undertakings. The same reason that makes us wrangle with a neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us whip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole province. They are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more. In a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same.

As to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man. Our histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made after the murderers of their masters. King Pyrrhus observing a dog that watched a dead man's body, and understanding that he had for three days together performed that office, commanded that the body should be buried, and took the dog along with him. One day, as he was at a general muster of his army, this dog, seeing his master's murderers, with great barking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first accusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after perfected by form of justice. As much was done by the dog of the wise Hesiod, who convicted the sons of Ganictor of Naupactus of the murder committed on the person of his master. Another dog being to guard a temple at Athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away the finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the warders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke, kept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he offered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his tail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and if the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place. The news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put themselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and at last found him in the city of Cromyon, and the thief also, whom they brought back to Athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in consideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn for the dog's daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to take care of it. Plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and that it happened in the age wherein he lived.

As to gratitude (for I think we need bring this word into a little repute), this one example, which Apion reports himself to have been an eye-witness of, shall suffice.

""One day,"" says he, ""at Rome, they entertained the people with the sight of the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions of an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious deportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud and dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. Amongst other slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts there was one Androdus, of Dacia, belonging to a Roman lord of consular dignity. This lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden stop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached nearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into acquaintance with him. This being done, and being now assured of what he sought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their masters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch, who was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. Androdus being by this kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so much heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to see the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. At which the people breaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave to be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who thereupon told him a new and a very strange story: ""My master,"" said he, ""being pro-consul in Africa, I was constrained, by his severity and cruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and, to hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the province, I thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and uninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of supporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other to kill myself. The sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat intolerable, I lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went into it Soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded and bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. At his coming I was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer of his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded foot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. I then drew out a great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar with him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel which was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best I could. He, finding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him down to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. From that time forward he and I lived together in this cave three whole years upon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting he always brought me the best pieces, which I roasted in the sun for want of fire, and so ate it. At last, growing weary of this wild and brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our ordinary provision, I departed thence, and the third day after was taken by the soldiers, who brought me from Africa to this city to my master, who presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild beasts. Now, by what I see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has now sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received at my hands."" This is the story that Androdus told the emperor, which he also conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general request, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the lion was, by order of the people, presented to him. ""We afterwards saw,"" says Apion, ""Androdus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash, from tavern to tavern at Rome, and receiving what money every body would give him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered with the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him saying, 'There goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the man that cured the lion.'""

We often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of us:—

                 Post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, thon
          It lacrymans, guttisque humectt grandibus ora.

                 ""To close the pomp, thon, the steed of state.
            Is led, the fun'ral of his lord to wait.
          Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace
          He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.""
As some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every one his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better kept than ours? As to the society and confederation they make amongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual assistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the cry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid and embody for his defence? The fish Scarus, when he has swallowed the angler's hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in pieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others present him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his teeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out.

Mullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over their back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut and saw it asunder. As to the particular offices that we receive from one another for the service of life, there are several like examples amongst them. 'Tis said that the whale never moves that she has not always before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason called the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be led and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in recompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether beast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster's mouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires into it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale never stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows it; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes wandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a ship that has lost her helm; which Plutarch affirms to have seen in the island of Anticyra. There is a like society betwixt the little bird called the wren and the crocodile. The wren serves for a sentinel over this great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach to fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him asleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice of his danger.
He feeds of this monster's leavings, who receives him familiarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt his teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and when he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to go out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing it any harm at all. The shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same intelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster kind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening of the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the shrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow of the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the quick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together devour the prey they have trapped in their fort. In the manner of living of the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of mathematics. As to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the place where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never stir thence till the next equinox; for which reason Aristotle himself attributes to them this science. As to geometry and arithmetic, they always form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and make up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round with six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind as before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may easily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the breadth, and the breadth to the length.

As to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it than in the example of the great dog sent to Alexander the Great from the Indies. They first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and after that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from his place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself, evidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the lists with him. Touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults, 'tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage killed his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never after eat, but starved himself to death. And as to clemency, 'tis said of a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put in to him, he suffered a two days' hunger rather than hurt it, and the third broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so unwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, And as to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation, it ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame together.

But that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the Sicilian Sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human thought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the birth? The poets indeed say that one only island, Delos, which was before a floating island, was fixed for the service of Latona's lying-in; but God has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed, made stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst the halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the shortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days and seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without danger. Their females never have to do with any other male but their own, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking him. If he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their shoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death. But the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet arrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon builds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials. Plutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones of some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some lengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner that she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done, and the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea beating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well jointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky, that open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is well built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does so close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by blows either of stone or iron without very much ado. And that which is more to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within, which is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive or admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing else it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so much as the water of the sea. This is a very dear description of this building, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does not give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture. Now from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon, and disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor comprehend?

To pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us and beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of things she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come to her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and placing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and divesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to lay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness, smoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean and superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and spiritual condition; as Rome and Paris, for example, that I have in my fancy, Paris that I imagine, I imagine and comprehend it without greatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without wood; this very same privilege, I say, seems evidently to be in beasts; for a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom we see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter, as if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in his soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and without body:—

                 Quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt
          In somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque spe,
            Et quasi de palm summas contendere vires:

                  ""You shall see maneg'd horses in their sleep
            Sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep,
           As if with all their force they striving were
            The victor's palm proudly away to bear:""
the hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see him pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and perfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur and without bones:—

           Venantumque canes in molli spe quiete
          Jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente
         Mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras,
           Ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum:
          Expergeftique sequuntur inania spe
          Cervorum simulacra, fag quasi dedita cernant;
           Donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se:

               ""And hounds stir often in their quiet rest,
         Spending their mouths, as if upon a quest,
         Snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went
          In a full chase upon a burning scent:
         Nay, being wak'd, imagin'd stags pursue,
         As if they had them in their real view,
         Till, having shook themselves more broad awake,
         They do at last discover the mistake:""
the watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and afterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger at hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and imperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:—

                Consueta domi catulorum blanda propago
            Degere, spe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem
           Discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant,
           Proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur.

                 ""The fawning whelps of household curs will rise,
          And, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes,
          Oft bark and stare at ev'ry one within,
          As upon faces they had never seen.""
to the beauty of the body, before I proceed any further I should know whether or no we are agreed about the description. 'Tis likely we do not well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our own human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any natural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat of the fire. But we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and liking:—

         Turpis Romano Belgicus ore color:

         ""A German hue ill suits, a Roman face.""
The Indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat noses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of gold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with great hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall upon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth, even below the roots. In Peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful, which they stretch out as far as they can by art. And a man now living says that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them in so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he did with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of an ear. There are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their teeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. The women are reputed more beautiful, not only in Biscay, but elsewhere, for having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen countries, as Pliny reports. The Mexicans esteem a low forehead a great beauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on the forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great reputation that they affect to give their children suck over their shoulders. We should paint deformity so. The Italians fashion it gross and massy; the Spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has it white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and vigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and majestic. Just as the preference in beauty that Plato attributes to the spherical figure the Epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square, and cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. But, be it how it will, nature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in the rest And if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if there be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others, and in greater number, that are more; a multis animalibus decore vincimur ""Many animals surpass us in beauty,"" even among the terrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure aside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much another thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we sufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the aerial. And this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter of, our erect stature, looking towards heaven our original,

                  Pronaque cum spectent animalia ctera terrain,
          Os homini sublime ddit, columque tueri
          Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus,

                ""Whilst all the brutal creatures downward bend
          Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,
          He set man's face aloft, that, with his eyes
          Uplifted, he might view the starry skies,""
is truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their sight absolutely turned towards heaven; and I find the gesture of camels and ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. What animals have not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite, as we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of heaven and earth as man? And what qualities of our bodily constitution, in Plato and Cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of beasts? Those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed of all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage, are baboons:—

          Simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis?

          ""How like to man, in visage and in shape,
         Is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?""
as to the internal and vital parts, the hog. In earnest, when I consider man stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of beauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, I find that we have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are to be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been kinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide ourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. Let us observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities offend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions withdraws and hides himself from his own kind. And really 'tis also an effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade prescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of the body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more but freely and fully to see what he loves:—

                 Ille quod obscnas in aperto corpore partes
            Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, hsit amor.

             ""The love that's tilting when those parts appear
         Open to view, flags in the hot career,""
And, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold humour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies that use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. It is not modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies so circumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are painted and tricked up for the public view:—

              Nec Veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ips
          Omnia summopere hos vit postscenia celant,
         Quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore:

              ""Of this our ladies are full well aware,
         Which make them, with such privacy and care,
         Behind the scene all those defects remove,
         Likely to check the flame of those they love,""
whereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not love, and that does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements we do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our richest ornaments and perfumes. This discourse reflects upon none but the ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend those divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see shine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial veil.

As to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty of nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. We attribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent good, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or good, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion, as reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend, essential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security, innocence, and health; health, I say, the fairest and richest present that nature can make us. Insomuch that philosophy, even the Stoic, is so bold as to say, ""That Heraclitus and Pherecides, could they have trucked their wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his dropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had done well."" By which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and putting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other proposition, which is also theirs; they say that if Circe had presented Ulysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise man, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that Ulysses ought rather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which Circe changed his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom itself would have spoke to him after this manner: ""Forsake me, let me alone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass."" How! the philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for this corporeal and terrestrial covering? It is then no more by reason, by discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; 'tis by our beauty, our fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must quit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. Well, I accept this open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts, upon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy. If beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical perfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to man, miserable, wicked, mad, man. For, in short, whatever is not as we are is nothing worth; and God, to procure himself an esteem among us, must put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. By which it appears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish pride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals, and separate ourselves from their society and condition.

But to return to what I was upon before; we have for our part inconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude of things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice, jealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying, disloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. Doubtless, we have strangely overpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and this capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price of this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject. Unless we shall also think fit, as even Socrates does, to add to the counterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, That whereas nature has prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of Venus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons."" Ut vinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar, nocet sopissime, melius est non adhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem incurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum celerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam pestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino, quam tam muniice et tam large dari? As it falls out that wine often hurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to give them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of an uncertain benefit, so I know not whether it had not been better for mankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we call reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous it is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so abundant manner, and with so liberal a hand."" Of what advantage can we conceive the knowledge of so many things was to Yarro and Aristotle? Did it exempt them from human inconveniences? Were they by it freed from the accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter?
Did they extract from their logic any consolation for the gout? Or, for knowing how this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less? Did they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations rejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some parts of the world wives are in common? On the contrary, having been reputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the Romans and the other amongst the Greeks, and in a time when learning did most flourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular excellence in their lives; nay, the Greek had enough to do to clear himself from some notable blemishes in his. Have we observed that pleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands astrology and grammar than with others?

            Illiterati num minus nervi rigent?

           ""Th' illiterate ploughman is as fit
            For Venus' service as the wit:""
or shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last?

                  Scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,
           Et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vit
           Longa tibi post hc fato meliore dabuntur.

                   ""Disease thy couch shall flee,
           And sorrow and care; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see
          Long years of happiness, till now unknown.""
I have known in my time a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser and more happy than the rectors of the university, and whom I had much rather have resembled. Learning, methinks, has its place amongst the necessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most, as beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful to it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. We stand very little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our society, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these carry themselves very regularly without erudition. If man was wise, he would take the true value of every thing according as it was useful and proper to his life. Whoever will number us by our actions and deportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than among the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. Old Rome seems to me to have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that learned Rome that ruined itself. And, though all the rest should be equal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for they cohabit singularly well with simplicity. But I will leave this discourse, that would lead me farther than I am willing to follow; and shall only say this further, 'tis only humility and submission that can make a complete good man. We are not to leave the knowledge of his duty to every man's own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not suffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to the imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we should at large forge ourselves duties that would, as Epicurus says, enjoin us to eat one another.

The first law that ever God gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it was a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire after, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a rational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. From obedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from selfopinion. And, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the devil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself into us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; Eritis sicut Dii, scientes bonum et malum. ""Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" And the sirens, in Homer, to allure Ulysses, and draw him within the danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. The plague of man is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance is so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and obedience; Cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes seductiones, secundum elementa mundi. ""Take heed, lest any man deceive you by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the rudiments of the world."" There is in this a general consent amongst all sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the tranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it?

                   Ad summum, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
            Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum;
            Prcipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est:

                   ""In short, the wise is only less than Jove,
            Rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above
           All earthly kings; with health supremely blest,
            Excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!""
It seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable and wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance. 'Tis as Epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the use of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion. The gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in intelligence. Man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his ills in essence. We have reason to magnify the power of our imagination; for all our goods are only in dream. Hear this poor calamitous animal huff! ""There is nothing,"" says Cicero, ""so charming as the employment of letters; of letters, I say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the immense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth, and the seas are discovered to us; 'tis they that have taught us religion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued our souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first, last, and middling; 'tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily and well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and without offence."" Does not this man seem to speak of the condition of the ever-living and almighty God? But as to effects, a thousand little countrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than his.

                 Deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte Memmi,
          Qui princeps vit rationem invenit earn, qu
           Nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem
           Fluctibus  tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris,
          In tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit:

               ""That god, great Memmus, was a god no doubt
         Who, prince of life, first found that reason out
         Now wisdom called; and by his art, who did
         That life in tempests tost, and darkness hid,
         Place in so great a calm, and clear a light:""
here are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man's understanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd, notwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. Of the same stamp and impudence is the promise of Democritus's book: ""I am going to speak of all things;"" and that foolish title that Aristotle prefixes to one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which he employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill himself,—Eusebius's Chronicon.

Of the Mortal Gods; and the judgment of Chrysippus, that ""Dion was as virtuous as God;"" and my Seneca himself says, that ""God had given him life; but that to live well was his own;"" conformably to this other: In virtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum Deo, non nobis haberemus: ""We truly glory in our virtue; which would not be, if it was given us of God, and not by ourselves;"" this is also Seneca's saying; ""that the wise man hath fortitude equal with God, but that his is in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals God."" There is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like temerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself equalled with God, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked with other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest than that of our Creator.

But we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and boldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions are founded. So long as man shall believe he has any means and power of himself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his Maker; his eggs shall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him to his shirt. Let us see some notable examples of the effects of his philosophy: Posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made him writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned the dolour, by crying out against it: ""Thou mayst do thy worst, I will not confess that thou art an evil."" He was as sensible of the pain as my footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least, and restraining it within the laws of his sect: Re succumbere non oportebat, verbis gloriantem. ""It did not become him, that spoke so big, to confess his frailty when he came to the test."" Arcesilas being ill of the gout, and Car-neades, who had come to see him, going away troubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet and breast: ""There is nothing comes thence hither,"" said he. This has something a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be disengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor subdued by it. The other stands more obstinately to his point, but, I fear, rather verbally than really. And Dionysius Heracleotes, afflicted with a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical resolutions. But even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they say, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes that attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely and evidently?—The philosopher Pyrrho, being at sea in very great danger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation of those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on board, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. Philosophy, when she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a gladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly observe much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other inconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished any one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. What is the cause that we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those of a horse, more easily than our own—but ignorance only? How many has mere force of imagination made sick? We often see men cause themselves to be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they only feel in opinion.—When real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us her's; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion; this hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the life-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous indisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying, this sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture; there must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against yourself. Compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations, to that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural appetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge, and without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is really ill. Whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has it in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when it shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it.

What I say of physic may generally serve in example for all other sciences. Thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers that placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our judgment My ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear; and having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of others, and of events I see elsewhere upon the like occasion, I find of all sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable to me. I receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and by so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is at present less ordinary and more rare; so far am I from troubling its repose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner of living. Beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our minds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. That which is told us of those of Brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to the serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but I rather attribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from all passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people that pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance, without letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion. And whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest and dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous performances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more acceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation of the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and tires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. What puts the soul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own promptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? Of what is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? As great friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from mortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls proceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; 'tis but half a turn of the toe from the one to the other. In the actions of madmen we see how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of the soul. Who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt folly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a supreme and extraordinary virtue? Plato says that melancholy persons are the most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly in none is there so great a propension to madness. Great wits are ruined by their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through his own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious, ingenious, and nearest formed, of any other Italian poet, to the air of the ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! Has he not vast obligation to this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded him? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him beside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences, that has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the exercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and without soul? I was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see him at Ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting both himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before his face, have been published unformed and incorrect.

Would you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a steady and secure posture? Muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and sloth. We must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we are fit to be led. And if one shall tell me that the advantage of having a cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage along with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the fruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our condition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and that the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a light grief does: Segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt. We are not so sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness.

                Pungit
           In cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus;
          Quando valere nihil quemquam movet. Hoc juvat unum,
         Quod me non torquet latus, aut pes;
         Ctera quisquam Vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem.

              ""The body with a little sting is griev'd,
         When the most perfect health is not perceiv'd,
         This only pleases me, that spleen nor gout
         Neither offend my side nor wring my foot;
         Excepting these, scarce any one can tell,
         Or e'er observes, when he's in health and well.""
Our well-being is nothing but the not being ill. Which is the reason why that sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure, has yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. To be freed from ill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as Ennius says,—

           Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali;
for that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and that seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active, moving, and, I know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that very pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. The appetite that carries us headlong to women's embraces has no other end but only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only requires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever. And so of the rest. I say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a state free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our condition. And yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility as to be totally without sense; for Crantor had very good reason to controvert the insensibility of Epicurus, if founded so deep that the very first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: ""I do not approve such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired. I am very well content not to be sick; but if I am, I would know that I am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, I would feel them."" In truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and sense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure, and finally annihilate man himself: Istud nihil dolere, non sine magn mercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore. ""An insensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity in the soul, and of stupidity of the body."" Evil appertains to man of course. Neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always pursued.

'Tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself throws us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify us against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this composition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap of the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the strokes and injuries of fortune. For what else is her meaning when she instructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us, and entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to comfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled delights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose it to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? Levationes gritudinum in avocatione a cogitand molesti, et revocation ad contemplandas voluptates, ponit; ""He directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by rejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;"" if it be not that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make use of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? For not only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has upon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to him to remember the pleasure he took in drinking Greek wine a month ago? It would rather only make matters worse to him:—

          Che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia.

           ""The thinking of pleasure doubles trouble.""
Of the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to remember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we have undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power, and counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek.

           Suavis laborum est prteritorum rmoria.

           ""Sweet is the memory of by-gone pain.""
How does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and steel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to this degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save myself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? For the memory represents to us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing that so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it. And 'tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to solicit her to lose it. And this is false: Est situm in nobis, ut et adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et suaviter meminerimus; ""it is in our power to bury, as it were, in a perpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and delightful memory of our successes;"" and this is true: Memini etiam quo nolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo. ""I do also remember what I would not; but I cannot forget what I would."" And whose counsel is this? His, qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus; ""who alone durst profess himself a wise man.""

                Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes
          Prstinxit stellas, exortus uti thereus Sol.

                ""Who from mankind the prize of knowledge won,
         And put the stars out like the rising sun.""
To empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to ignorance?

         Iners malorum remedium ignorantia est.

         ""Ignorance is but a dull remedy for evils.""
We find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow frivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest reason will not answer the purpose, provided they administer satisfaction and comfort Where they cannot cure the wound, they are content to palliate and benumb it I believe they will not deny this, that if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could maintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment, they would accept it:—

                Potare, et spargere flores
          Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.

               ""Give me to drink, and, crown'd with flowers, despise
          The grave disgrace of being thought unwise.""
There would be a great many philosophers of Lycas's mind this man, being otherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his family, and not failing in any office of his duty, either towards his own or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful things, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed with a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of the finest sights and the best comedies in the world; and being cured by the physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by suit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination:—

                Pol I me occidistis, amici,
           Non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas,
           Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error;

                ""By heaven! you've killed me, friends, outright,
          And not preserved me; since my dear delight
         And pleasing error, by my better sense
          Unhappily return'd, is banished hence;""
with a madness like that of Thrasylaus the son of Pythodorus, who made himself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of Pirus, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for his profit; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and receiving them with the greatest joy; and when his brother Crito caused him to be restored to his better understanding, he infinitely regretted that sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and free from all anxiety of mind. 'Tis according to the old Greek verse, that ""there is a great deal of convenience in not being over-wise.""

And Ecclesiastes, ""In much wisdom there is much sorrow;"" and ""Who gets wisdom gets labour and trouble.""

Even that to which philosophy consents in general, that last remedy which she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life we are not able to endure. Placet?—Pare. Non placet?—Qucumque vis, exi. Pungit dolor?—Vel fodiat sane. Si nudus es, da jugulum; sin tectus armis Vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, rsist; ""Does it please?—Obey it. Not please?—Go where thou wilt. Does grief prick thee,—nay, stab thee?—If thou art naked, present thy throat; if covered with the arms of Vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it."" And this word, so used in the Greek festivals, aut bibat, aut abeat, ""either drink or go,"" which sounds better upon the tongue of a Gascon, who naturally changes the h into v, than on that of Cicero:—

               Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.
         Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;
         Tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius quo
           Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius tas.

               ""If to live well and right thou dost not know,
         Give way, and leave thy place to those that do.
          Thou'st eaten, drunk, and play'd to thy content,
          'Tis time to make thy parting compliment,
          Lest youth, more decent in their follies, scoff
         The nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;""
What is it other than a confession of his impotency, and a sending back not only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity, insensibility, and nonentity?

               Democritum postquam matura vetustas
          Admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis;
          Sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse.

              ""Soon as, through age, Democritus did find
           A manifest decadence in his mind,
           He thought he now surviv'd to his own wrong,
         And went to meet his death, that stay'd too long.""
'Tis what Antisthenes said, ""That a man should either make provision of sense to understand, or of a halter to hang himself;"" and what Chrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet Tyrtus:—

         ""Or to arrive at virtue or at death;""
and Crates said, ""That love would be cured by hunger, if not by time; and whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope."" That Sextius, of whom both Seneca and Plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having applied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of philosophy, resolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the progress of his studies too tedious and slow. He ran to find death, since he could not overtake knowledge. These are the words of the law upon the subject: ""If peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no remedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out of his body as out of a leaky skiff; for 'tis the fear of dying, and not the love of life, that ties the fool to his body.""

As life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent and better, also it renders it as I was saying before: ""The simple and ignorant,"" says St. Paul, ""raise themselves up to heaven and take possession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into the infernal abyss."" I am neither swayed by Valentinian, a professed enemy to all learning and letters, nor by Licinius, both Roman emperors, who called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by Mahomet, who, as 'tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his followers; but the example of the great Lycurgus, and his authority, with the reverence of the divine Lacedemonian policy, so great, so admirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any institution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great weight. Such as return from the new world discovered by the Spaniards in our fathers' days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly those nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do, where there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts of men and business:—

                   Di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,
           D'esamine, e di carte di procure,
           Hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli
          Di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:
          Per cui le faculta de* poverelli
           Non sono mai nelle citt sicure;
            Hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d'ambi i lati,
            Notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.

                    ""Their bags were full of writs, and of citations,
            Of process, and of actions and arrests,
            Of bills, of answers, and of replications,
            In courts of delegates, and of requests,
            To grieve the simple sort with great vexations;
            They had resorting to them as their guests,
            Attending on their circuit, and their journeys,
           Scriv'ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.""
It was what a Roman senator of the latter ages said, that their predecessors' breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed with a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time were all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices; that is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with learning and eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. Incivility, ignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of innocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train; humility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal things that support and maintain human society, require an empty and docile soul, and little presuming upon itself.

Christians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil curiosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to become more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he precipitated himself into eternal damnation. Pride was his ruin and corruption. 'Tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes him embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and wandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies, than to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be led and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten road. 'Tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old Greek saying, that superstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father: [—Greek—] Ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?

After that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him the title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining himself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment. He knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and more eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than he. At last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor wise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his God considered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity in man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and simplicity his best wisdom. The sacred word declares those miserable among us who have an opinion of themselves: ""Dust and ashes,"" says it to such, ""what hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?"" And, in another place, ""God has made man like unto a shadow,"" of whom who can judge, when by removing the light it shall be vanished! Man is a thing of nothing.

Our force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height, that, of the works of our Creator, those best bear his mark, and are with better title his, which we the least understand. To meet with an incredible thing is an occasion to Christians to believe; and it is so much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human reason. If it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle; and if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular thing. Melius scitur Deus nesdendo: ""God is better known by not knowing him,"" says St. Austin: and Tacitus, Sanctius est ac reverentius de actis Deorum credere, quam scire; ""it is more holy and reverent to believe the works of God than to know them;"" and Plato thinks there is something of impiety in inquiring too curiously into God, the world, and the first causes of things: Atque illum quidem parentem hujus universitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in vulgtis, nefas: ""to find out the parent of the world is very difficult; and when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,"" says Cicero. We talk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some great thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. We say that God fears, that God is angry, that God loves,

           Immortalia mortali sermone notantes:

          ""Giving to things immortal mortal names.""
These are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in God, according to our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. It only belongs to God to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it in our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon the earth. How can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil, be properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? How can reason and intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent things; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? How justice, which distributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the society and community of men, how is that in God? How temperance, which is the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the Divinity? Fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little appertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to him. For which reason Aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue and vice: Neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent, imbecilla essent omnia? ""He can neither be affected with favour nor indignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.""

The participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is, is not acquired by our own force: God has sufficiently given us to understand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common people, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ to instruct us in his admirable secrets. Our faith is not of our own acquiring; 'tis purely the gift of another's bounty: 'tis not by meditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have acquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the imbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it; and our blindness more than our clearness of sight: 'tis more by__ the mediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing of the divine wisdom. 'Tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts cannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring nothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written, ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.""

Finally, should I examine whether it be in the power of man to find out that which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so many ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; I believe he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all he has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his own weakness. We have only by a long study confirmed and verified the natural ignorance we were in before. The same has fallen out to men truly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their heads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain in maturity, begin to flag and droop. So men, having tried and sounded all things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of so many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but vanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural condition. 'Tis what Velleius reproaches Cotta withal and Cicero, ""that they had learned of Philo, that they had learned nothing."" Pherecydes, one of the seven sages, writing to Thales upon his death-bed; ""I have,"" said he, ""given order to my people, after my interment, to carry my writings to thee. If they please thee and the other sages, publish; if not, suppress them. They contain no certainty with which I myself am satisfied. Neither do I pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it. I rather open than discover things."" The wisest man that ever was, being asked what he knew, made answer, ""He knew this, that he knew nothing."" By which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what we know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even what we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our ignorance. We know things in dreams, says Plato, and are ignorant of them in truth. Ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi, nihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia curricula vito. ""Almost all the ancients have declared that there is nothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses are too limited, men's minds too weak, and the course of life too short."" And of Cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he was worth, Valerius says, ""That he began to disrelish letters in his old age; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any one party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and then in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy."" Dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans plerumque, et mihi diffidens. ""Something I must say, but so as to affirm nothing; I inquire into all things, but for the most part in doubt and distrust of myself.""

I should have too fair a game should I consider man in his common way of living and in gross; yet I might do it by his own rule, who judges truth not by weight, but by the number of votes. Let us set the people aside,

              Qui vigilans stertit,....
           Mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti;

                ""Half of his life by lazy sleep's possess'd,
          And when awake his soul but nods at best;""
who neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie idle; I will take man in his highest ground. Let us consider him in that little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who, having been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have moreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised it to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. They have adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and supported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and adorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without the world; 'tis in these is placed the utmost and most supreme height to which human nature can attain. They have regulated the world with policies and laws. They have instructed it with arts and sciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. I shall make account of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience. Let us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. The errors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may boldly avow as their own.

Whoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say that he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet upon the search. All philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her design is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. The Peripatetics, Epicureans, Stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. These established the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain knowledge. Clitomachus, Carneades, and the Academics, have despaired in their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our understandings. The result of these is weakness and human ignorance. This sect has had the most and the most noble followers. Pyrrho, and other skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the ancients to be taken from Homer, the seven sages, and from Archilochus and Euripides, and to whose number these are added, Zeno, Democritus, and Xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth. These conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are infinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second sort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it; for this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the difficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they doubt whether man is capable:—

                 Nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit,
           An sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur.

               ""He that says nothing can be known, o'erthrows
           His own opinion, for he nothing knows,
          So knows not that.""
The ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an absolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that the profession of the Pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not to make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any thing. Of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and consentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous, without inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another, so light as it is. Zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon these divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: ""An open and expanded hand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little bending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left he yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge."" Now this situation of their judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without application or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a peaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations we receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we have of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience, obstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they are exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after a very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they affirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed, and love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment, which is their end. They only put forward their propositions to contend with those they think we have in our belief. If you take their arguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; 'tis all one to them, they have no choice. If you maintain that snow is black, they will argue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the one nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. If you hold, of certain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do. Yea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they will argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and determine that you doubt. And by this extremity of doubt, which jostles itself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even of those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and ignorance. ""Why shall not they be allowed to doubt,"" say they, ""as well as the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? Can any thing be proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to consider as ambiguous?"" And where others are carried away, either by the custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by accident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay, and for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such an opinion, to the sect whether Stoic or Epicurean, with which they are prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot forsake: Ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn, tanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt; ""every one cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest;"" why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their liberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? hoc liberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas: ""in this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater power of judging."" Is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the necessity that curbs others? Is it not better to remain in suspense than to entangle one's self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has produced? Is it not much better to suspend one's persuasion than to intermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: ""What shall I choose?"" ""What you please, provided you will choose."" A very foolish answer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point at, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are ignorant of.

Take the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will never be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with a hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. Is it not better to keep out of this hurly-burly? You are permitted to embrace Aristotle's opinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour and life, and to give the lie to Plato thereupon, and shall they be interdicted to doubt him? If it be lawful for Pantius to maintain his opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the Stoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the same in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his masters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he is a professor and a member? If it be a child that judges, he knows not what it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. They have reserved for themselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of the care of defence. If you strike them, they care not, provided they strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. If they overcome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short, they verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that nothing is known, 'tis well; if they cannot prove it, 'tis also well: Ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur, facilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur: ""That when like sentiments happen pro and con in the same thing, the assent may on both sides be more easily suspended."" And they make account to find out, with much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why 'tis true; that which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe, than what they do. Their way of speaking is: ""I assert nothing; it is no more so than so, or than neither one nor t'other; I understand it not. Appearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, pro or con, is the same. Nothing seems true, that may not seem false."" Their sacramental word is that is to say, ""I hold, I stir not."" This is the burden of their song, and others of like stuff. The effect of which is a pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. They make use of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine. Whoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment without bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever, conceives a true idea of Pyrrhonism. I express this fancy as well as I can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors themselves represent it a little variously and obscurely.

As to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the common fashion. They yield and give up themselves to their natural inclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution of laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; Non enim nos Deus ista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit. ""For God would not have us know, but only use those things."" They suffer their ordinary actions to be guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. For which reason I cannot consent to what is said of Pyrrho, by those who represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and unsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of precipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. This is to enhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or a stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning, enjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making use of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason. The fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped of lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and renounced. Yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to follow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if he means to live. And if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not knowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists upon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the convenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which he is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances, provided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. He has a body, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. And although he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of judging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his consent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true appearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the offices of his life with great liberty and convenience. How many arts are there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge; that decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so! There are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek it; but not to make it stay when we touch it. We are much more prudent, in letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without inquiry. A soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards tranquillity and repose. Men that judge and control their judges, do never duly submit to them.

How much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of religion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those over-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human causes! There is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show of likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty, confessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from above, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him the divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more room to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against common observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a sworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and irreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. 'Tis a blank paper prepared to receive such forms from the finger of God as he shall please to write upon it. The more we resign and commit ourselves to God, and the more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. ""Take in good part,"" says Ecclesiastes, ""the things that present themselves to thee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy knowledge."" Dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van sunt: ""The Lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity.""

Thus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open profession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the Dogmatists, which is the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only assume this face of confidence and assurance that they may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought to establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have proceeded in their search of truth: Quam docti jingunt magis quam nrunt: ""Which the learned rather feign than know."" Timus, being to instruct Socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men, proposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient, if his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact reasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of his followers has thus imitated: Ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut Pythius Apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu dixero; sed, ut homunculus, probabilia conjectur sequens: ""I will, as well as I am able, explain; affirming, yet not as the Pythian oracle, that what I say is fixed and certain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture."" And this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death; he has elsewhere translated from the very words of Plato: Si forte, de Deorum natur ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo consequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui disseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia dicentur, nihil ultra requiratis? ""If perchance, when we discourse of the nature of God, and the world's original, we cannot do it as we desire, it will be no great wonder. For it is just you should remember that both I who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if probable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more."" Aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men's opinions and beliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has gone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of truth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony of others; which made Epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his writings. This is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by him that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. In earnest, we sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so inextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice; it is, in effect, a Pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. Hear Cicero's protestation, who expounds to us another's fancy by his own: Qui requirunt quid de quque re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam necesse est,... Hoc in philosophi ratio, contra omnia disserendi, nuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a Socrate, repetita ab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu ad nostram viget cetatem..........Hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse dicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et assentiendi nota. ""They who desire to know what we think of every thing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. This practice in philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely concluding nothing, begun by Socrates, repeated by Arcesilaus, and confirmed by Cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. We are they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false amongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there can be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent."" Why hath not Aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected difficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the subject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow and fleshless bone to pick? Clitomachus affirmed ""That he could never discover by Carneades's writings what opinion he was of."" This was it that made Epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured Heraclitus the epithet of [—Greek—] Difficulty is a coin the learned make use of, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human sottishness easily takes for current pay.

                 Claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes...
         Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque
          Inversis qu sub verbis latitantia cemunt.

                ""Bombast and riddle best do puppies please,
         For fools admire and love such things as these;
         And a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase,
          Up to the height doth their wise wonder raise.""
Cicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time to the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really worth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life, and more profitable and proper studies. The Cyrenaick philosophers, in like manner, despised physics and logic. Zeno, in the very beginning of the books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use. Chrysippus said ""That what Plato and Aristotle had writ, concerning logic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;"" and could not believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. Plutarch says the same of metaphysics. And Epicurus would have said as much of rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy excepted, of all the sciences; and Socrates of them all, excepting that which treats of manners and of life. Whatever any one required to be instructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand an account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he examined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that and supernumerary: Parum mihi placeant e littero quo ad virtutem doctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt. ""That learning is in small repute with me which nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue."" Most of the arts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they did not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in those very matters wherein there was no solid advantage.

As to the rest, some have looked upon Plato as a dogmatist, others as a doubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other. Socrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions and stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and professes to have no other science but that of opposing himself. Homer, their author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of philosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose. 'Tis said that ten several sects sprung from Plato; yet, in my opinion, never did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not.

Socrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping others to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and that by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred upon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty of bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that could; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their birth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and circumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils and fortunes of others.

It is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the ancients have observed in the writings of Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides, Xenophanes, and others. They have a way of writing, doubtful in substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix their style with some dogmatical periods. Is not the same thing seen in Seneca and Plutarch? How many contradictions are there to be found if a man pry narrowly into them! So many that the reconciling lawyers ought first to reconcile them every one to themselves. Plato seems to have affected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he might with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity and variety of his own fancies. It is as well to treat variously of things as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more copiously and with greater profit. Let us take example from ourselves: judgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative speaking; and yet those arrets that our parliaments give the people, the most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the reverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of the persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion, which with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the dispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law and equity will permit And the largest field for reprehension that some philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and contradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either on purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every thing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility of all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim—""In a slippery and sliding place let us suspend our belief;"" for, as Euripides says,—

         ""God's various works perplex the thoughts of men.""
Like that which Empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and compelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: ""No, no, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from us; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;"" according to the divine saying: Cogitationes mortalium timid, et incert adinventiones nostro et providentice. ""For the thoughts of mortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain."" It is not to be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt after, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being of itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the pleasures, the Stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise of the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too much knowledge.

Democritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell presently to considering with himself whence they should derive this unusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the table to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid observing, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that ""he need not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel in which there had been honey."" He was vexed at this discovery, and that she had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his curiosity of matter to work upon: ""Go thy way,"" said he, ""thou hast done me an injury; but, for all that, I will seek out the cause as if it were natural;"" and would willingly have found out some true reason for a false and imaginary effect. This story of a famous and great philosopher very clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon the pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. Plutarch gives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that whereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of inquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician should allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the pleasure of quenching it by drinking. Satius est supervacua discere, quam nihil. ""'Tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at all."" As in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often single and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the palate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds extract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there be nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. Thus they say: ""The consideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and elevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing them with those that are celestial and high. The mere inquisition into great and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no other benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it."" This is what they profess. The vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more manifest in this other example which they so often urge. ""Eudoxus wished and begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to comprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should thereby be immediately burned."" He would at the price of his life purchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same time be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge lose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have acquired.

I cannot easily persuade myself that Epicurus, Plato, and Pytagoras, have given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. They were too wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable and uncertain. But in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world then was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind of image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions that might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though false, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose them. Unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti vi. ""These things every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of knowledge.""

One of the ancients, who was reproached, ""That he professed philosophy, of which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,"" made answer, ""That this was truly to philosophize.""

They wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an employment well suited to our natural curiosity. Some things they wrote for the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that consideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public opinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience to the laws and customs of their country.

Plato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where he writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. When he plays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and boldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade the vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well how fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most immoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his Laws, he takes singular care that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and fabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to imprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice not to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that are unprofitable and hurtful. He says very roundly, in his Republic, ""That it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them."" It is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed truth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their reputation. 'Tis the misery of our condition that often that which presents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the most useful to life. The boldest sects, as the Epicurean, Pyrrhonian, and the new Academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at the end of the account.

There are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some to the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or wrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so abstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very often forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they themselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any certain truth, but merely for exercise. Non tam id sensisse quod dicerent, quam exercere ingnia materio difficultate videntur voluisse. ""They seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to have had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the matter."" And if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so great inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been produced by those excellent and admirable men? As, for example, what can be more vain than to imagine, to guess at God, by our analogies and conjectures? To direct and govern him and the world by our capacities and our laws? And to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity, with what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to our natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his glorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our miseries?

Of all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to me the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged God as an incomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all goodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour and reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies soever—

               Jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, demque,
            Progenitor, genitrixque.

                ""Jove, the almighty, author of all things,
         The father, mother, of both gods and kings.""
This zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious eye. All governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious men and actions have everywhere had suitable events. Pagan histories acknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed for their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; God, through his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish the tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason gave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. Not only deceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man has forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that St. Paul found in repute at Athens, that which they had dedicated ""to the unknown God"" seemed to him the most to be excused.

Pythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that the knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be indefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing else than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection, every one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity. But if Numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this project; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any prefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use; the human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity of inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented according to its own model. The divine majesty has thus, in some sort, suffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our advantage. His supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our earthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for 'tis man that believes and prays. I shall omit the other arguments upon this subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the sight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our Saviour's passion, that the ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices accommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the senses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of very advantageous effect.

Of those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that universal blindness, I should, I fancy, most incline to those who adored the sun:—

               La Lumire commune,
          L'oil du monde; et si Dieu au chef porte des yeux,
           Les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux,
            Qui donnent vie  touts, nous maintiennent et gardent,
           Et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent:
          Ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons,
         Selon qu'il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;
         Qui remplit l'univers de ses vertus cognues;
          Qui d'un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues;
           L'esprit, l'ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant,
           En la course d'un jour tout le Ciel tournoyant;
           Plein d'immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme;
            Lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme:
          En repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans sjour;
         Fils aisn de nature, et le pre du jour:

                ""The common light that equal shines on all,
           Diffused around the whole terrestrial ball;
           And, if the almighty Ruler of the skies
          Has eyes, the sunbeams are his radiant eyes,
           That life and safety give to young and old,
            And all men's actions upon earth behold.
           This great, this beautiful, the glorious sun,
           Who makes their course the varied seasons run;
         That with his virtues fills the universe,
           And with one glance can sullen clouds disperse;
          Earth's life and soul, that, flaming in his sphere,
          Surrounds the heavens in one day's career;
         Immensely great, moving yet firm and round,
         Who the whole world below has made his bound;
         At rest, without rest, idle without stay,
         Nature's first son, and father of the day:""
forasmuch as, beside this grandeur and beauty of his, 'tis the only piece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us; and by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering into so great admiration and reverence of it.

Thales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed God to be a Spirit that made all things of water; Anaximander, that the gods were always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an infinite number of worlds; Anaximines, that the air was God, that he was procreate and immense, always moving. Anaxagoras the first, was of opinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by the power and reason of an infinite spirit. Alcmon gave divinity to the sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. Pythagoras made God a spirit, spread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted; Parmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by the ardour of light. Empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which all things are composed, to be gods; Protagoras had nothing to say, whether they were or were not, or what they were; Democritus was one while of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods; another while, the nature that darts out those images; and then, our science and intelligence. Plato divides his belief into several opinions; he says, in his Timus, that the Father of the World cannot be named; in his Laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and elsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the stars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which have been received by ancient institution in every republic.

Xenophon reports a like perplexity in Socrates's doctrine; one while that men are not to inquire into the form of God, and presently makes him maintain that the sun is God, and the soul God; that there is but one God, and then that there are many. Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, makes God a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul. Aristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one while he gives the world another master, and another while makes God the heat of heaven. Zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets; the sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the seventh and eighth, the sun and moon. Heraclides Ponticus does nothing but float in his opinion, and finally deprives God of sense, and makes him shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven and earth. Theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his fancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the understanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. Strato says that 'tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation, and diminution, without form and sentiment Zeno says 'tis the law of nature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal; and takes away the accustomed gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Vesta. Diogenes Apolloniates, that 'tis air. Zenophanes makes God round, seeing and hearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature. Aristo thinks the form of God to be incomprehensible, deprives him of sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else; Cleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world, another the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and environing all. Perseus, Zeno's disciple, was of opinion that men have given the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added any notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things themselves. Chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding theories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes, the men also that have been deified. Diagoras and Theodoras flatly denied that there were any gods at all. Epicurus makes the gods shining, transparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two worlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such members as we have; which members are to them of no use:—

              Ego Deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum;
         Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus.

              ""I ever thought that gods above there were,
         But do not think they care what men do here.""

Trust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found the bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many philosophical heads! The perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained this over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much displease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me, in comparing them. And all other choice than what comes from the express and immediate hand of God seems to me a choice of very little privilege. The policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than the schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more variable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our reason. The things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified; wherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the extremest weakness of understanding. I would much rather have gone along with those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as their nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room to imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them extraordinary faculties. But to have made gods of our own condition, of whom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to them desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love, jealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and obsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of the human understanding;

              Qu procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant,
          Inque Dem numro qu sint indigna videri;

              ""From divine natures these so distant are,
         They are unworthy of that character.""
Formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt; genera, conjugia, cognationes, omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis humano: nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur; accipimus enim deorurn cupiditates, cegritudines, iracundias; ""Their forms, ages, clothes, and ornaments are known: their descents, marriages, and kindred, and all adapted to the similitude of human weakness; for they are represented to us with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger of the gods;"" as having attributed divinity not only to faith, virtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to voluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill fortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:—

              Quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores?
         O curv in terris anim et colestium inanes!

               ""O earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led,
         To every spark of heav'nly influence dead!
         Think ye that what man values will inspire
         In minds celestial the same base desire?""
The Egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of hanging, that any one should say that their gods, Serapis and Isis, had formerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been such; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth, signified, says Varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to conceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence cancel all the veneration paid to them. Seeing that man so much desired to equal himself to God, he had done better, says Cicero, to have attracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither below, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take it right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like vanity of opinion.

When philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and make a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and power, I cannot believe they speak as they think. When Plato describes Pluto's orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend us after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies, and accommodates them to the feeling we have in this life:—

                Secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum
         Sylva tegit; cur non ips in morte relinquunt;

              ""In secret vales and myrtle groves they lie,
         Nor do cares leave them even when they die.""
when Mahomet promises his followers a Paradise hung with tapestry, gilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with wenches of excelling beauty, rare wines, and delicate dishes; it is easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their promises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes and opinions suitable to our mortal appetites. And yet some amongst us are fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the resurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts of worldly conveniences and pleasures. Can we believe that Plato, he who had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the Divinity as thence to derive the name of the Divine Plato, ever thought that the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that incomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are able to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient, to participate of beatitude or eternal pains? We should then tell him from human reason: ""If the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other life are of the same kind that I have enjoyed here below, this has nothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses should be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the contentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to, all this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is nothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present condition, it cannot be of any value. All contentment of mortals is mortal. Even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends, if that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still continues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and finite conveniences. We cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of these high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them; to have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable, inexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than those of our miserable experience."" ""Eye hath not seen,"" saith St. Paul, ""nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him."" And if, to render us capable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, Plato, sayest, by thy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that by physical doctrine it be no more us;—

                Hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille
          Tractus ab monio non erat Hector eqao;

               He Hector was whilst he could fight, but when
          Dragg'd by Achilles' steeds, no Hector then;
it must be something else that must receive these recompenses:—

              Quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo;
         Trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant.

             ""Things changed dissolved are, and therefore die;
         Their parts are mix'd, and from their order fly.""
For in Pythagoras's metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that he imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of Csar is enclosed, does espouse Csar's passions, or that the lion is he? For if it was still Csar, they would be in the right who, controverting this opinion with Plato, reproach him that the son might be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like absurdities. And can we believe that in the mutations that are made of the bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are not other than their predecessors? From the ashes of a phoenix, a worm, they say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can imagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? We see our silk-worms, as it were, die and wither; and from this withered body a butterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would it be to imagine that this was still the first! That which once has ceased to be is no more:—

              Nec, si materiam nostram collegerit tas
         Post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est,
         Atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit,
         Pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum,
         Interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra.

              ""Neither tho' time should gather and restore
         Our matter to the form it was before,
         And give again new light to see withal,
         Would that new figure us concern at all;
         Or we again ever the same be seen,
         Our being having interrupted been.""
And, Plato, when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the spiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the recompense of another life, thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as little appearance of truth:—

              Scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam
          Dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto;

              ""No more than eyes once from their optics torn,
         Can ever after any thing discern;""
for, by this account, it would no more be man, nor consequently us, who would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two principal essential parts, the separation of which is the death and ruin of our being:—

              Inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque
         Deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes;

              ""When once that pause of life is come between,
           'Tis just the same as we had never been;""
we cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members, and that the earth consumes them:—

              Et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque
         Corporis atque anim consistimus uniter apti.

             ""What's that to us? for we are only we,
         While soul and body in one frame agree.""
Moreover, upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice of or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it was themselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? And why should they be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have created in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their will, they might prevent him from falling? Might not Epicurus, with great colour of human reason, object this to Plato, did he not often save himself with this sentence: ""That it is impossible to establish any thing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?"" She does nothing but err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things. Who does more evidently perceive this than we? For although we have given her certain and infallible principles; and though we have enlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased God to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve never so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or wander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she loses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this vast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint, and without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and common road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths.

Man cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of his capacity. ""Tis a greater presumption,"" says Plutarch, ""in them who are but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods than it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of singing; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and martial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the effects of an art he is totally a stranger to."" Antiquity, I believe, thought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine grandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties, and adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities; offering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances, mummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it, and our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the sounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to our vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and with the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as Tiberius Sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained from the enemy in Sardinia for a sacrifice to Vulcan; and Paulus milius, those of Macedonia, to Mars and Minerva; and Alexander, arriving at the Indian Ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into the sea, in honour of Thetes; and moreover loading her altars with a slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several nations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and I believe there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:—

               Sulmone creatos
         Quatuor hc juvenes, totidem quos educat Ufens,
         Viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris.

              ""Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,
          He took in flight, and living victims led,
         To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire
         In sacrifice before his fun'ral pyre.""
The Get hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing but a journey to their god Zamolxis. Every five years they dispatch some one among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand in need of. This envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching him, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to deliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon which the rest throw his body with all their force. If he happen to be wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, 'tis held a certain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon as a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the same manner in his stead. Amestris, the mother of Xerxes, being grown old, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of Persia, to be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify some infernal deity. And even to this day the idols of Themixtitan are cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no sacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of innocent blood:—

              Tantum religio potuit suadere maloram.

         ""Such impious use was of religion made,
         So many demon acts it could persuade.""
The Carthaginians immolated their own children to Saturn; and those who had none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in the mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented countenance.

It was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our afflictions; like the Lacedemonians, who regaled their Diana with the tormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake, very often to death. It was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the architect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away the punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that poor Iphigenia, at the port of Aulis, should by her death and immolation acquit, towards God, the whole army of the Greeks from all the crimes they had committed;

               Et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,
         Hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis;

              ""That the chaste virgin in her nuptial band
         Should die by an unnat'ral father's hand;""
and that the two noble and generous souls of the two Decii, the father and the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the affairs of Rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of the enemy: Quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo Romano non possent, nisi tales viri occidissent? ""How great an injustice in the gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of Rome unless such men perished!"" To which may be added, that it is not for the criminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure nor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who considers nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and cannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that suffers. The divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us, both for its justice and for our own penalty. And therefore it was a ridiculous humour of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, who, to interrupt the continued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw the dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing that by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied the revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly, ordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found in the belly of a fish. And then to what end were those tearings and dismemberments of the Corybantes, the Menades, and, in our times, of the Mahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their prophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast, eyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat? Tantus est perturbto mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii placentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt. ""So great is the fury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of reason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so cruel as to approve."" The use of this natural contexture has not only respect to us, but also to the service of God and other men; 'tis as unjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon any pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to exercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that are stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing them according to reason: Ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios habere merentur? In regi libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam; sed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit. ""Where are they so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that rate? Some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes: but no man at his master's command has put his own hand to unman himself."" So did they fill their religion with several ill effects:—

         Spius olim Religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta.

         ""In elder times Religion did commit most fearful crimes.""
Now nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto the divine nature, which will not blemish and stain it with much imperfection.

How can that infinite beauty, power, and goodness, admit of any correspondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without extreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness? Infirmum dei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus. ""For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men."" Stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, ""Whether the gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?""—""You are indiscreet,"" answered he; ""let us withdraw apart, if you would talk of such things."" Nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power besieged by our reasons (I call our ravings and dreams reason, with the dispensation of philosophy, which says, ""That the wicked man, and even the fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason""), we would subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our understandings,—him who has made both us and our knowledge. Because that nothing is made of nothing, God therefore could not make the world without matter. What! has God put into our hands the keys and most secret springs of his power? Is he obliged not to exceed the limits of our knowledge? Put the case, O man! that thou hast been able here to mark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he has employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this work? Thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little cave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much; whereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. This part is nothing in comparison of the whole:—

                Omnia cum colo, terrque, manque,
           Nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem.

               ""The earth, the sea, and skies, from pole to pole,
           Are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole.""
'Tis a municipal law that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is universal Tie thyself to that to which thou art subject, but not him; he is not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. If he has in some sort communicated himself unto thee, 'tis not to debase himself unto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his power; the human body cannot fly to the clouds; rules are for thee. The sun runs every day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth cannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a wall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot preserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon earth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. 'Tis for thee that he has made these rules; 'tis thee that they concern; he has manifested to Christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it pleased him. And, in truth, why, almighty as he is, should he have limited his power within any certain bounds? In favour of whom should he have renounced his privilege? Thy reason has in no other thing more of likelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that there is a plurality of worlds:—

                 Terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant,
           Non esse unica, sed numro magis innumerali.

                  ""That earth, sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are,
           Not single, but innumerable were.""
The most eminent minds of elder times believed it; and some of this age of ours, compelled by the appearances of human reason, do the same; forasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and one,

          Cum in summ res nulla sit una,
           Unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat;

                ""Since nothing's single in this mighty place,
           That can alone beget, alone increase;""
and that all the kinds are multiplied in some number; by which it seems not to be likely that God should have made this work only without a companion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally drained in this individual.

               Quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est
           Esse alios alibi congressus materiali;
          Qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet ther.

               ""Wherefore 'tis necessary to confess
          That there must elsewhere be the like congress
          Of the like matter, which the airy space
          Holds fast within its infinite embrace.""
Especially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so credible that Plato affirms it, and that many of our people do either confirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient opinion that the heavens, the stars, and other members of the world, are creatures composed of body and soul, mortal in respect of their composition, but immortal by the determination of the Creator. Now if there be many worlds, as Democritus, Epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed, what do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like manner concern the rest? They may peradventure have another form and another polity. Epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. We see in this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of places; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that new comer of the world discovered by our fathers; 'tis all there another thing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world they had no knowledge either of Bacchus or Ceres. If Pliny and Herodotus are to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little resembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal natures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having their mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites; where they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead, and a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the lower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years old, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is so hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men have no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject seed of a black colour. What shall we say of those that naturally change themselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? And if it be true, as Plutarch says, that in some place of the Indies there are men without mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours, how many of our descriptions are false? He is no longer risible, nor, perhaps, capable of reason and society. The disposition and cause of our internal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and of no use.

Moreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose those fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? And yet we must undertake to circumscribe thereto God himself! How many things do we call miraculous, and contrary to nature? This is done by every nation and by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. How many occult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? For, for us to go ""according to nature,"" is no more but to go ""according to our understanding,"" as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we are able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and irregular. Now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the wisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them that there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be assured that snow is white, and Anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if there be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge or ignorance, which Metrodorus of Chios denied that man was able to determine; or whether we live, as Euripides doubts whether the life we live is life, or whether that we call death be not life, [—Greek—] and not without some appearance. For why do we derive the title of being from this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural condition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and also a good part of the moment itself. Others swear there is no motion at all, as followers of Melissus, and that nothing stirs. For if there be but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him, nor motion from one place to another, as Plato proves: ""That there is neither generation nor corruption in nature."" Protagoras says that there is nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all things; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all things; Nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is more than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty; Parmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general; that there is but one thing; Zeno, that one same is not, and that there is nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in itself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are yet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. According to these doctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false or vain.

This way of speaking in a Christian man has ever seemed to me very indiscreet and irreverent. ""God cannot die; God cannot contradict himself; God cannot do this or that."" I do not like to have the divine power so limited by the laws of men's mouths; and the idea which presents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously and reverently expressed.

Our speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. Most of the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our suits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and most wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the conventions and treaties of amity of princes. How many quarrels, and of how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable, hoc,* created in the world? Let us take the clearest conclusion that logic itself

            * Montaigne here refers to the controversies between
              the Catholics and Protestants about transubstantiation.
presents us withal; if you say, ""It is fine weather,"" and that you say true, it is then fine weather. Is not this a very certain form of speaking? And yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow the example: If you say, ""I lie,"" if you say true, you do lie. The art, the reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the other, and yet we are gravelled. The Pyrrhonian philosophers, I see, cannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for they would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of affirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch that when they say ""I doubt,"" they are presently taken by the throat, to make them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do doubt. By which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves under this medical comparison, without which their humour would be inexplicable: when they pronounce, ""I know not,"" or, ""I doubt,"" they say that this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less than rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself off with them. This fancy will be more certainly understood by interrogation: ""What do I know?"" as I bear it with the emblem of a balance.

See what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the present disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too hard, they will roundly tell you, ""that it is not in the power of God to make it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in several places at once."" And see, too, what advantage the old scoffer made of this. ""At least,"" says he, ""it is no little consolation to man to see that God cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though he would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he cannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that he who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had them; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion."" And that the comparison of man to God may yet be made out by jocose examples: ""He cannot order it so,"" says he, ""that twice ten shall not be twenty."" This is what he says, and what a Christian ought to take heed shall not escape his lips. Whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied this foolish daring of language, to reduce God to their own measure:—

                Cras vel atr Nube polum, Pater, occupato,
          Vel sole puro; non tamen irritum
          Quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque
           Diffinget infectumque reddet
            Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.

               ""To-morrow, let it shine or rain,
           Yet cannot this the past make vain:
           Nor uncreate and render void
           That which was yesterday enjoyed.""
When we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but one instant with God; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same with his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend it not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must make the Divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the dreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and weigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. Mirum quo procdat improbitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu. ""'Tis wonderful to what the wickedness of man's heart will proceed, if elevated with the least success."" How magisterially and insolently does Epicurus reprove the Stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and happy being appertained only to God, and that the wise man had nothing but a shadow and resemblance of it! How temerariously have they bound God to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name of a Christian shall ever do again)! and Thales, Plato, and Pythagoras have enslaved him to necessity. This arrogance of attempting to discover God with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has attributed to the Divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what happens to us every day, of attributing to God important events, by a particular assignment. Because they weigh with us, they conclude that they also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant regard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary course: Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt: ""The gods are concerned at great matters, but slight the small."" Listen to him; he will clear this to you by his reason: Nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant: ""Neither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the least concerns."" As if to that King of kings it were more or less to subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his providence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle than in the leap of a flea. The hand of his government is laid upon every thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our interest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway nothing with him. Deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit in parvis: ""God is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no less in the least"" Our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison ever before us. Because our employments are a burden to us, Strato has courteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their priests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and with her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world, discharging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: Quod beatum terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri: ""What is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives any to another."" Nature will that in like things there should be a like relation. The infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a like number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy presupposes as many that preserve and profit. As the souls of the gods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst themselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of men, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some ecstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the body, they could not see. ""Men,"" says St. Paul, ""professing themselves to be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man."" Do but take notice of the juggling in the ancient deifications. After the great and stately pomp of the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the pyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the same time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the soul went into Paradise. We have a thousand medals, and particularly of the worthy Faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these deified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. 'Tis pity that we should fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions,

          Quod finxere, timent,

          ""They fear their own inventions,""
like children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow, that they themselves have smeared and smutted. Quasi quicquam infelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur:

""As if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by his own imagination."" 'Tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour him that we have made. Augustus had more temples than Jupiter, served with as much religion and belief of miracles. The Thracians, in return of the benefits they had received from Agesilaus, came to bring him word that they had canonized him: ""Has your nation,"" said he to them, ""the power to make gods of whom they please? Pray first deify some one amongst yourselves, and when I shall see what advantage he has by it, I will thank you for your offer."" Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot make a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. Hear Trismegistus in praise of our sufficiency: ""Of all the wonderful things, it surmounts all wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it."" And take here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:—

               Nosse cui divos et coli munina soli,
          Aut soli nescire, datum.

               ""To whom to know the deities of heaven,
          Or know he knows them not, alone 'tis given.""
""If there is a God, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature, he has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. If he be without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action; and if he has a body, it is perishable."" Is not here a triumph? we are incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more excellent nature that has put a hand to the work. It were a foolish and ridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the universe. There must then be something that is better, and that must be God. When you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not know who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for rats. And this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial palace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some possessor, who is much greater than we? Is not the most supreme always the most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. Nothing without a soul and without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. The world produces us, the world then has soul and reason. Every part of us is less than we. We are part of the world, the world therefore is endued with wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. 'Tis a fine thing to have a great government; the government of the world then appertains to some happy nature. The stars do us no harm; they are then full of goodness. We have need of nourishment; then so have the gods also, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. Worldly goods are not goods to God; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being offended are equally testimonies of imbecility; 'tis therefore folly to fear God. God is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more. The divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the first is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we are companions. We have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness, charity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. In conclusion, building and destroying, the conditions of the Divinity, are forged by man, according as they relate to himself. What a pattern, and what a model! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as we please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:—

           Non, si tu ruperis, inquit.

          ""Not if thou burst,"" said he.
Profecto non Deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo cogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant? ""Certainly they do not imagine God, whom they cannot imagine; but they imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but themselves, not to him, but to themselves."" In natural things the effects do but half relate to their causes. What's this to the purpose? His condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote, and too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our conclusions. 'Tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place; our ways lie too low. We are no nearer heaven on the top of Mount Cenis than at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe. They debase God even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times, and so many generations. Paulina, the wife of Satuminus, a matron of great reputation at Rome, thinking she lay with the god Serapis, found herself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the priests of his temple. Varro, the most subtle and most learned of all the Latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of Hercules's temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the other for Hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and a wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his own. The sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. Her name was Laurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told her, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly reward; which proved to be Taruncius, a rich young man, who took her home to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. She, in her turn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the people of Rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed to her. As if it had not been sufficient that Plato was originally descended from the gods by a double line, and that he had Neptune for the common father of his race, it was certainly believed at Athens, that Aristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair Perictione, could not, and was warned by the god Apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and untouched, till she should first be brought to bed. These were the father and mother of Plato. How many ridiculous stories are there of like cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! And how many husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! In the Mahometan religion there are Merlins enough found by the belief of the people; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely conceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much in their language.

We are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable than its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above their own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all other things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend or contract, but that's all; for beyond that relation and principle our imagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out thence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions: of all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore God must be of that form. No one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without reason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; God is therefore clothed in a human figure. Ita est informatum et anticipatum mentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de Deo cogitet, forma occurrat hu-mana. ""It is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so prepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of God, a human figure ever presents itself to the imagination."" Therefore it was that Xenophanes pleasantly said, ""That if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as 'tis likely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and glorify themselves in it, as we do. For why may not a goose say thus; ""All the parts of the universe I have an interest in; the earth serves me to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence upon me; I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters; there is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me; I am the darling of nature! Is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves me? 'Tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the same by his fellow-men, and so do I the worms that kill and devour him."" As much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the account of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high and beautiful region. Tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa natura. ""So flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself.""

Now by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the world; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for us; ''tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims. Look into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years and more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have neither acted nor spoken but for man. She does not allow them any other consultation or occupation. See them here against us in war:—

               Domitosque Hercule manu
          Telluris juvenes, unde periculum
          Fulgens contre mu it domus
          Saturai veteris.

          ""The brawny sons of earth, subdu'd by hand
          Of Hercules on the Phlegran strand,
          Where the rude shock did such an uproar make,
          As made old Saturn's sparkling palace shake.""
And here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a return for our having so often shared in theirs:—

          Neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti
          Fundamenta quatit, totamque  sedibus urbem
          Emit: hie Juno Scas svissima portas Prima tenet.

               ""Amidst that smother Neptune holds his place,
          Below the walls' foundation drives his mace,
          And heaves the city from its solid base.
          See where in arms the cruel Juno stands,
           Full in the Scan gate.""
The Caunians, jealous of the authority of their own proper gods, armed themselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their precincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords, by that means to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory. Their powers are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that the phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: Adeo minimis etiam rebus prava religio inserit Deos? ""At such a rate does false religion create gods for the most contemptible uses."" This one makes grapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that over merchandise; for every sort of artisan a god; this has his province and reputation in the east; that his in the west:—

               ""Here lay her armour, here her chariot stood.""

               O sancte Apollo, qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines!

                 ""O sacred Phoebus, who with glorious ray,
           From the earth's centre, dost thy light display.""

          Pallada Cecropid, Minola Creta Dianam,
           Vulcanum tellus Hypsipylea colit,
          Junonem Sparte, Pelopeladesque Mycen;
          Pinigerum Fauni Mnalis ora caput;
          Mars Latio venerandus.

               ""Th' Athenians Pallas, Cynthia Crete adore,
           Vulcan is worshipped on the Lemnian shore.
           Proud Juno's altars are by Spartans fed,
          Th' Arcadians worship Faunus, and 'tis said
          To Mars, by Italy, is homage paid.""
to our necessity; this cures horses, that men,

          Hic illius arma, Hic currus fuit.
This has only one town or family in his possession; that lives alone; that in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:—

               Junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo.

                ""And temples to the nephew joined are,
          To those were reared to the great-grandfather.""
In here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and thirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce one ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a door—that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold. Four to a child—protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and sucking. Some certain, some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are not yet entered Paradise:—

               Quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore,
          Quas dedimus cert terras habitare sinanras:

               ""Whom, since we yet not worthy think of heaven,
          We suffer to possess the earth we've given.""
There are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. Some of a mean betwixt the divine and human nature; mediators betwixt God and us, adorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite in titles and offices; some good; others ill; some old and decrepit, and some that are mortal. For Chrysippus was of opinion that in the last conflagration of the world all the gods were to die but Jupiter. Man makes a thousand pretty societies betwixt God and him; is he not his countryman?

          Jovis incunabula Creten.

          ""Crete, the cradle of Jupiter.""
And this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject, Scvola, a high priest, and Varro, a great theologian in their times, make us: ""That it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of many things that are true, and believe many things that are false."" Quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod fallitur. ""Seeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be made free, 'tis fit he should be deceived."" Human eyes cannot perceive things but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap miserable Phton took for attempting to guide his father's horses with a mortal hand. The mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after the same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. If you ask of philosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will she return, if not that it is iron, or, with Anaxagoras, stone, or some other matter that she makes use of? If a man inquire of Zeno what nature is? ""A fire,"" says he, ""an artisan, proper for generation, and regularly proceeding."" Archimedes, master of that science which attributes to itself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty; ""the sun,"" says he, ""is a god of red-hot iron."" Was not this a fine imagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical demonstrations? Yet not so inevitable and useful but that Socrates thought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the land a man bought or sold; and that Polynus, who had been a great and famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest vanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly gardens of Epicurus. Socrates in Xenophon, concerning this affair, says of Anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in celestial and divine matters, ""That he had cracked his brain, as all other men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing belong to them:"" when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not consider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse, that it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that fire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that we are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and plants. 'Tis Socrates's opinion, and mine too, that the best judging of heaven is not to judge of it at all. Plato having occasion, in his Timous, to speak of the demons, ""This undertaking,"" says he, ""exceeds my ability."" We are therefore to believe those ancients who said they were begotten by them; 'tis against all reason to refuse a man's faith to the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved by any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of domestic and familiar things.

Let us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and natural things. Is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those to whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain, another body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is manifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits cannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them material, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:—

                Temo aureus, aurea summ
            Curvatura rot, radiorum argenteus ordo.

                ""Gold was the axle, and the beam was gold;
           The wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll'd.""
You would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters, that went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range the wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing colours about the axis of necessity, according to Plato:—

               Mundus domus est maxima rerum,
          Quam quinque altiton fragmine zon
          Cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis
          Stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo there, lun
          Bigas acceptat.

               ""The world's a mansion that doth all things hold,
          Which thundering zones, in number five, enfold,
          Through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs,
          And that with sparkling constellations, shines,
          In heaven's arch marks the diurnal course
          For the sun's chariot and his fiery horse.""
These are all dreams and fanatic follies. Why will not nature please for once to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means and conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? Good God, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science! I am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it really is, and I shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things than my own ignorance.

Have I not read in Plato this divine saying, that ""nature is nothing but enigmatic poesy!"" As if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady picture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false lights to puzzle our conjectures: Latent ista omnia crassis occullata et circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu penetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit. ""All those things lie concealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human wit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth."" And certainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. Whence do the ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and the first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. Plato is but a poet unripped. Timon calls him, insultingly, ""a monstrous forger of miracles."" All superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. Just as women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and instead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as they stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight of every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and borrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say, legitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice); she gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she herself informs us were invented; for these epicycles, eccentrics, and concentrics, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of the stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject; as also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really is, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the greatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest invention. Plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and those of beasts, says, ""I should know that what I have said is truth, had I the confirmation of an oracle; but this I will affirm, that what I have said is the most likely to be true of any thing I could say.""

'Tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels; let us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our contexture.

There is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and astonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found out in this poor little human body. In earnest, they have good reason, upon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and parts have they employed to erect and build it. To assist the motions they see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in how many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it? in how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they raised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to be perceived? And how many offices and vocations have they assigned him? They make it an imaginary public thing. 'Tis a subject that they hold and handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place, displace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and yet they possess it not They cannot, not in reality only, but even in dreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that will escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with a thousand false and fantastic patches. And it is not reason to excuse them; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven, earth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some slight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint and obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or any other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of them a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and despise them if they fail in it.

I am very well pleased with the Milesian girl, who observing the philosopher Thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and to have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he might stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up his thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided for those that were under his feet. Doubtless she advised him well, rather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as Democritus says, by the mouth of Cicero,—

             Quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas.

                  ""No man regards what is under his feet;
             They are always prying towards heaven.""
But our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in hand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the stars. As Socrates says, in Plato, ""That whoever meddles with philosophy may be reproached as Thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of that which is before him. For every philosopher is ignorant of what his neighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of what they both are, whether beasts or men.""

Those people, who find Sebond's arguments too weak, that are ignorant of nothing, that govern the world, that know all,—

                Qu mare compescant caus; quid temperet annum;
           Stell sponte su, jussve, vagentur et errent;
          Quid premat obscurum lun, quid profrt orbem;
          Quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors;

                ""What governs ocean's tides,
          And through the various year the seasons guides;
          Whether the stars by their own proper force,
           Or foreign power, pursue their wand'ring course;
          Why shadows darken the pale queen of night;
           Whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;—
          What nature's jarring sympathy can mean;""
have they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they have met with of knowing their own being? We see very well that the finger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary motion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our direction; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another paleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon the brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and astonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members; at one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies something lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a breach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection and contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet man knew: Omnia incerta ratione, et in natur majestate abdita. ""All uncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,"" says Pliny. And St Augustin, Modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus.... omnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse homo est, ""The manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether wonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man."" And yet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received according to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if it were religion and law. 'Tis received as gibberish which is commonly spoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is admitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more to be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of his talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the utmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to be accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled with lies and fopperies. The reason that men doubt of divers things is that they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root, where the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches; they do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it has been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether Galen has said any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. In truth it was very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and that tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and arts. The god of scholastic knowledge is Aristotle; 'tis irreligion to question any of his decrees, as it was those of Lucurgus at Sparta; his doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as another. I do not know why I should not as willingly embrace either the ideas of Plato, or the atoms of Epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of Leucippus and Democritus, or the water of Thales, or the infinity of nature of Anaximander, or the air of Diogenes, or the numbers and symmetry of Pythagoras, or the infinity of Parmenides, or the One of Musus, or the water and fire of Apollodorus, or the similar parts of Anaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of Empedocles, or the fire of Heraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions and determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its certitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as I should the opinion of Aristotle upon this subject of the principles of natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces—matter, form, and privation. And what can be more vain than to make inanity itself the cause of the production of things? Privation is a negative; of what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that are? And yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of logic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to defend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority is the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire.

It is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please; for, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other parts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. By this way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture; for our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our belief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they please, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and approbation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right and left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. Whatever springs from these presuppositions is our master and our God; he will take the level of his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us up to the clouds, if he so please. In this practice and negotiation of science we have taken the saying of Pythagoras, ""That every expert person ought to be believed in his own art"" for current pay. The logician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the rhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet his measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from the arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for their foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by which human judgment is everywhere kept in check. If you come to rush against the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this sentence in their mouths, ""That there is no disputing with persons who deny principles."" Now men can have no principles if not revealed to them by the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the end, is nothing but dream and vapour. To those that contend upon presupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same axiom upon which the dispute is. For every human presupposition and declaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make the difference. Wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and first the generals and those that tyrannize over us. The persuasion of certainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty; and there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less philosophers, than the Philodoxes of Plato; we must inquire whether fire be hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or soft within our knowledge?

And as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that doubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself into the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid to put ice into his bosom;—they are pitiful things, unworthy of the profession of philosophy. If they had let us alone in our natural being, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they present themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow our own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they might then have reason to talk at that rate; but 'tis from them we have learned to make ourselves judges of the world; 'tis from them that we derive this fancy, ""That human reason is controller-general of all that is without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing, that can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and understood."" This answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy the happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without Aristotle's precepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer would perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they borrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all where the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be as capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. They need not tell us, ""It is true, for you see and feel it to be so;"" they must tell me whether I really feel what I think I do; and if I do feel it, they must then tell me why I feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the name, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities of the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is not to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is their test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, 'tis a test full of falsity, error, weakness, and defect.

Which way can we better prove it than by itself? If we are not to believe her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to judge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her own being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect of it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour borrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the Almighty; there is her habitation and recess; 'tis thence that she imparts her rays, when God is pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as Balias issued from her father's head, to communicate herself to the world.

Now let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul, not of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the celestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which Thales attributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead thereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which appertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:—

                    Ignoratur enim, qu sit natura animai;
             Nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur;
             Et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;
            An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas,
            An pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se.

                ""For none the nature of the soul doth know,
            Whether that it be born with us, or no;
           Or be infused into us at our birth,
           And dies with us when we return to earth,
           Or then descends to the black shades below,
           Or into other animals does go.""
Crates and Dicarchus were of opinion that there was no soul at all, but that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; Plato, that it was a substance moving of itself; Thales, a nature without repose; Aedepiades, an exercising of the senses; Hesiod and Anaximander, a thing composed of earth and water; Parmenides, of earth and fire; Empedocles, of blood:—

          Sanguineam vomit ille animam;

          ""He vomits up his bloody soul.""
Posidonius, Cleanthes, and Galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion—

          Igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo;

           ""Their vigour of fire and of heavenly race.""
Hippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; Varro, that it was an air received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart, and diffused throughout the whole body; Zeno, the quintessence of the four elements; Heraclides Ponticus, that it was the light; Zenocrates and the Egyptians, a mobile number; the Chaldeans, a virtue without any determinate form:—

               Habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse,
          Harmoniam Grci quam dicunt.

               ""A certain vital habit in man's frame,
          Which harmony the Grecian sages name.""
Let us not forget Aristotle, who held the soul to be that which naturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with as cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the essence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but only takes notice of the effect Lactantius, Seneca, and most of the Dogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand; after all this enumeration of opinions, Harum sententiarum quo vera sit, Deus aliquis viderit: ""Of these opinions which is the true, let some god determine,"" says Cicero. ""I know by myself,"" says St Bernard, ""how incomprehensible God is, seeing I cannot comprehend the parts of my own being.""

Heraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and demons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far towards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound was the essence of it.

Neither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it. Hippocrates and Hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain; Democritus and Aristotle throughout the whole body;—


               Ut bona spe valetudo cum dicitur esse
           Corporis, et non est tamen hc pars ulla ralentis;

                ""As when the body's health they do it call,
          When of a sound man, that's no part at all.""
Epicurus in the stomach;

               Hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus;
          Hc loca circum Ltiti mulcent.

               ""For this the seat of horror is and fear,
          And joys in turn do likewise triumph here.""
The Stoics, about and within the heart; Erasistratus, adjoining the membrane of the epicranium; Empedocles, in the blood; as also Moses, which was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts, because the soul is there seated; Galen thought that every part of the body had its soul; Strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; Qu facie quidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est: ""What figure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired into,"" says Cicero. I very willingly deliver this author to you in his own words; for should I alter eloquence itself? Besides, it were but a poor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither very frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. But the reason why Chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest of that sect do, is not to be omitted; ""It is,"" says he, ""because when we would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when we would pronounce y, which signifies I, we let the lower jaw fall towards the stomach."" This place ought not to be passed over without a remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these considerations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a proof to the Greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. No human judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes sleep. Why do we fear to say? The Stoics, the fathers of human prudence, think that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours and strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can disengage itself from the burden. Some hold that the world was made to give bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own fault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation having been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less depraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or dully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much created matter. But the spirit that for his punishment was invested with the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular measure of change.

The extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment and blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that, according to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are taken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable places; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were most found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and proceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity and presumption. The beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish; observe to what a pitch Plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take notice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when he defined a man to be ""a two-legged animal without feathers: giving those who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having pulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of Plato.""

And what did the Epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they first imagine that their atoms that they said were bodies having some weight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till they were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this description, it was impossible they should unite and join to one another, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so many parallel lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that they should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they should moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they might unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that attack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? ""If the atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it never fall out that they made a house or a shoe? Why at the same rate should we not believe that an infinite number of Greek letters, strewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the Iliad?""—""Whatever is capable of reason,"" says Zeno, ""is better than that which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world; the world is therefore capable of reason."" Cotta, by this way of argumentation, makes the world a mathematician; 'and tis also made a musician and an organist by this other argumentation of Zeno: ""The whole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the world; therefore the world is wise."" There are infinite like examples, not only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that do not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much of ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one another in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and opinions.

Whoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom would produce wonders. I willingly muster up these few for a pattern, by a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound and moderate instructions. Let us judge by these what opinion we are to have of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that have raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest errors are to be found.

For my part, I am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge casually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about reason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts of fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker. This same Plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere, after Socrates, ""That he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that he is a member of the world the hardest to understand."" By this variety and instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the hand, to this resolution of their irresolution. They profess not always to deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one while disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another in some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with it, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry, alter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real opinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to the public use. They will not make an open profession of ignorance, and of the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children; but they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a troubled and inconstant science.

I advised a person in Italy, who had a great mind to speak Italian, that provided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being ambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use of the first word that came to the tongue's end, whether Latin, French, Spanish, or Gascon, and that, by adding the Italian termination, he could not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either Tuscan, Roman, Venetian, Piedmontese, or Neapolitan, and so fall in with some one of those many forms. I say the same of Philosophy; she has so many faces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams and ravings are there to be found. Human fancy can conceive nothing good or bad that is not there: Nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum. ""Nothing can be said so absurd, that has not been said before by some of the philosophers."" And I am the more willing to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they are spun out of myself, and without any pattern, I know they will be found related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say, ""See whence he took it!"" My manners are natural, I have not called in the assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are, when it came into my head to lay them open to the world's view, and that to expose them to the light in a little more decent garb I went to adorn them with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally to find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and examples. I never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near worn out and spent; a new figure—an unpremeditated and accidental philosopher.

But to return to the soul. Inasmuch as Plato has placed reason in the brain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; 'tis likely that it was rather an interpretation of the movements of the soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of a body, into several members. And the most likely of their opinions is that 'tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers, comprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by divers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according to his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one while hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same power carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain; which appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do immediately offend the faculties of the soul; and 'tis not incongruous that it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body

                Medium non deserit unquam
          Coeli Phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustrt.

                ""Phoebus ne'er deviates from the zodiac's way;
          Yet all things doth illustrate with his ray.""
As the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the world with them:—

               Ctera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,
           Paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.

               ""The other part o' th' soul diffus'd all o'er
          The body, does obey the reason's lore.""
Some have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body, whence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again return, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:—

               Deum namque ire per omnes
          Terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;
          Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,
          Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:
          Scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri
          Omnia; nec morti esse locum:

               ""For God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole
          Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;
          Each at its birth, from him all beings share,
          Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;
          To him return, and, loos'd from earthly chain,
          Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again,
           Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,
           Dwell in high heaven, and star th' ethereal way.""
Others, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others, that they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels of fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some that they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted them; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return thither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten from father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other natural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to their fathers;

               Instillata patris virtus tibi;
          Fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;

               ""Thou hast thy father's virtues with his blood:
          For still the brave spring from the brave and good;""
and that we see descend from fathers to their children not only bodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and inclinations of the soul:—

                Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum
          Seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis
          A patribus datur, et patrius pavor incitt artus?
          Si non certa suo quia semine seminioque
          Vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto.

               ""For why should rage from the fierce lion's seed,
          Or from the subtle fox's craft, proceed;
          Or why the tim'rous and flying hart
          His fear and trembling to his race impart;
          But that a certain force of mind does grow,
           And still increases as the bodies do?""
That thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children the faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal vices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the ill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls had any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had been some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory of their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of discoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:—

               Si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,
          Cur super anteactam tatem meminisse nequimus,
          Nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?

               ""For at our birth if it infused be,
          Why do we then retain no memory
          Of our foregoing life, and why no more
          Remember any thing we did before?""
for, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be, we must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and purity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of the body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be after they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow that they should remember, being got in the body, as Plato said, ""That what we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;"" a thing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. Forasmuch, in the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but what we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its office it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have learned. Secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a true knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence; whereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct her; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and conception having never been planted in her. To say that the corporal prison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they are there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of acknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that men sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby concluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to come:—

               Nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,
          Omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,
          Non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.

               ""For if the mind be changed to that degree
          As of past things to lose all memory,
          So great a change as that, I must confess,
          Appears to me than death but little less.""
Furthermore, 'tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force and effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her perfections are vain and useless to her; 'tis by her present condition that all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of man only that she is to render an account It had been injustice to have stripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in the time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness and infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass an infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon the consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two, or at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity than an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively to determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion, too, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life. Plato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future payments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human duration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them temporal limits. By this they judged that the generation of the soul followed the common condition of human things, as also her life, according to the opinion of Epicurus and Democritus, which has been the most received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw it bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it increase in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was very manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after that its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:—

               Gigni pariter cum corpore, et una
          Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.

               ""Souls with the bodies to be born we may
          Discern, with them t' increase, with them decay.""
They perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with divers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness; capable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and languor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the foot;

               Mentem sanari, corpus ut grum,
            Ceraimus, et flecti medicin posse videmus;

                ""Sick minds, as well as bodies, we do see
           By Med'cine's virtue oft restored to be;""
dazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by the vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some medicaments, and roused by others,—

               Corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est,
           Corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat;

               ""There must be of necessity, we find,
          A nature that's corporeal of the mind,
          Because we evidently see it smarts
            And wounded is with shafts the body darts;""
they saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the mere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability of reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no resistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents; the slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of Socrates, to shake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and so to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former knowledge,—

               Vis.... animal Conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum
          Disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno;

               ""The power of the soul's disturbed; and when
          That once is but sequestered from her, then
           By the same poison 'tis dispersed abroad;""
and this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an infant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if it were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that Cato, who ever disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a looking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at the thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease called by physicians hydrophobia:—

              Vis morbi distracta per artus
          Turbat agens animam, spumantes quore salso
         Ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und.

              ""Throughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease
         Disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas,
         The foaming waves to swell and boil we see,
          Stirred by the wind's impetuosity.""
Now, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to encounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search of that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving himself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use to a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and deliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in a philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled, overturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too vehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in itself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the stomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain.

                Morbis in corporis avius errat
          Spe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur;
          Interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum
         ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti:

         ""For when the body's sick, and ill at ease,
         The mind doth often share in the disease;
          Wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by
         A heavy and a stupid lethargy,
         Is overcome and cast into a deep,
         A most profound and everlasting sleep.""
The philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more than another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually in their mouths, to console our mortal condition: ""The soul is either mortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it will change for the better.""—They never touch the other branch, ""What if she change for the worse?"" and leave to the poets the menaces of future torments. But thereby they make themselves a good game. These are two omissions that I often meet with in their discourses. I return to the first.

This soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and so firm. Our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. As to the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that the mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and the immortal, was unimaginable:—

              Quippe etenim mortale terao jungere, et una
         Consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse,
         Desipere est. Quid enim diversius esse putandum est,
         Aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque,
         Quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni
          Junctum, in concilio, svas tolerare procellas?

               ""The mortal and th' eternal, then, to blend,
         And think they can pursue one common end,
         Is madness: for what things more diff'rent are.
         Distinct in nature, and disposed to jar?
         How can it then be thought that these should bear,
         When thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?""
Moreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the body:—

         Simul ovo fessa fatiscit:

         ""Fatigued together with the weight of years:""
which, according to Zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently demonstrate to us; for he looks upon it ""as a fainting and fall of the soul, as well as of the body:"" Contrahi animum et quasi labi putat atque decidere: and, what they perceived in some, that the soul maintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they attributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the last extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one the hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or alteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some parts do not remain vigorous and entire:—

              Non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet gri,
         In nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.

              ""So, often of the gout a man complains,
         Whose head is, at the same time, free from pains.""
The sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl's eyes are to the splendour of the sun, says Aristotle. By what can we better convince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? For the contrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, Cicero says, was first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by Pherecydes

Syrius, in the time of King Tullus (though some attribute it to Thales, and others to others), 'tis the part of human science that is treated of with the greatest doubt and

reservation. The most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point principally, to fly to the refuge of the Academy. No one doubts what Aristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the ancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: Rem gratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium: ""A thing more acceptable in the promisors than the provers."" He conceals himself in clouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to those of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the matter itself.

Two things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without the immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the vain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful

repute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression, as Plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance of human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will pursue them even after the death of the guilty. Man is excessively solicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power provided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body, and glory to preserve the name. He has employed all his wit and opinion to the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop himself by his inventions. The soul, by reason of its anxiety and impotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek out consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to which she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention delivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance, upon them than upon herself. But 'tis wonderful to observe how the most constant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion of the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments are, when they go about to prove it by human reason: Somnia sunt non docentis, sed optantis: ""They are dreams, not of the teacher, but wisher,"" says one of the ancients. By which testimony man may know that he owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since that even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to hold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of it. All things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether true or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. 'Twas for the chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable condition and incapacity, that God wrought the perplexity and confusion of the tower of Babel. Whatever we undertake without his assistance, whatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly. We corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant, by our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. What course soever man takes of himself, God still permits it to come to the same confusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just chastisement wherewith he crushed Nimrod's presumption, and frustrated the vain attempt of his proud structure; Perdam sapientiam sapientium, et prudentiam prudentium reprobabo. ""I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."" The diversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work, what are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and discordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the vain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what would hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? This saint has very much obliged me: Ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis exercitatio est, aut elationis attritio ""The very concealment of the truth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption."" To what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness and folly!

But to return to my subject. It was truly very good reason that we should be beholden to God only, and to the favour of his grace, for the truth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive the fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal beatitude. Let us ingenuously confess that God alone has dictated it to us, and faith; for 'tis no lesson of nature and our own reason. And whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within and without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider man impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or faculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. The more we give and confess to owe and render to God, we do it with the greater Christianity. That which this Stoic philosopher says he holds from the fortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he had held it from God? Cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve momentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut colentium. Utor hc public persuasione. ""When we discourse of the immortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the infernal powers, is of no small advantage. I make use of this public persuasion."" Now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject is particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have superadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what condition this immortality of ours was. Let us omit the Stoics, (usuram nobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper, negant. ""They give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say our soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they deny,"") who give to souls a life after this, but finite. The most universal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in various places, is that of which they make Pythagoras the author; not that he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal of weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: ""That souls, at their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to another, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually travelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;"" and he himself said that he remembered he had been tha-lides, since that Euphorbus, afterwards Hermotimus, and, finally, from Pyrrhus was passed into Pythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. And some have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and come down again:—

              O pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est
         Sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti
          Corpora? Qu lucis miseris tam dira cupido?

                ""O, father, is it then to be conceiv'd
         That any of these spirits, so sublime,
         Should hence to the celestial regions climb,
          And thence return to earth to reassume
          Their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb?
          For wretched life whence does such fondness come?""
Origen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse estate. The opinion that Varro mentions is that, after four hundred and forty years' revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies; Chrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time unknown and unlimited. Plato, who professes to have embraced this belief from Pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite vicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither punishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its life here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of the affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has passed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her memory. Observe her progress elsewhere: ""The soul that has lived well is reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived ill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again removed into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and shall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural constitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself from those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted with."" But I will not omit the objection the Epicureans make against this transmigration from one body to another; 'tis a pleasant one; they ask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should chance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world. For the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and crowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they further demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting till new quarters are made ready for them? Or, on the contrary, if more animals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an ill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it would fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive.

              Denique comrabia ad Veneris, partusque ferarum
         Esse animas prsto, deridiculum esse videtur;
         Et spectare immortales mortalia membra
         Innumero numro, certareque prproperanter
          Inter se, qu prima potissimaq insinueter.

              ""Absurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget,
         Or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait,
         Expect the falling body, fight and strive
         Which first shall enter in and make it live.""
Others have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to animate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred out of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others divide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others make it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. Some make it immortal, without
sense or knowledge. There are others, even among ourselves, who have believed that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch thinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few things which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining elsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. ""We are told,"" says he, ""and steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous men, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and from saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in sacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all passibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but in real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and perfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end."" But who desires to see him—him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the whole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and relate his miracles upon this subject, I refer him to his treatise of the Moon, and of the Demon of Socrates, where he may, as evidently as in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of philosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry; human understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all things to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course of life, return to infancy and dotage. See here the fine and certain instructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul.

Neither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our corporal parts. Let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we should lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors. Let us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof men produce one another; for as to their first production it is no wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human understanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. Archelaus, the physician, whose disciple and favourite Socrates was, according to Aristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous slime, expressed by the heat of the earth; Pythagoras says that our seed is the foam or cream of our better blood; Plato, that it is the distillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from this, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work; Alcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it is so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who are immoderate in that exercise; Democritus, that it is a substance extracted from the whole mass of the body; Epicurus, an extract from soul and body; Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the blood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is a blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they judge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood; wherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any appearance from so infinite a confusion. Now, to bring this seed to do its work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? Aristotle and Democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that 'tis nothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and motion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. Galen, on the contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence of seeds there can be no generation. Here are the physicians, the philosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about the dispute, ""For what term women carry their fruit?"" and I, for my part, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman goes eleven months with child. The world is built upon this experience; there is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all these controversies; and yet we cannot agree.

Here is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the knowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part We have proposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what she could say. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated how little she understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in himself, in what can he? Quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere, qui sui nesciat. ""As if he could understand the measure of any other thing, that knows not his own."" In earnest, Protagoras told us a pretty flam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as his own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any other creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary in himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this favourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily to conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. When Thales reputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he at the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is impossible.

You,* for whom I have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write so long a discourse, will not refuse to support your Sebond by the ordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and in this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing trick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; 'tis a desperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your adversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely, and then very reservedly, put in practice. 'Tis great temerity to lose yourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged, as Gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of Persia, Darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he should kill Gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,

         * The author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing
          Margaret de Valois.
though he should run them both through at once. I have known desperate weapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered them put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to them both, censured for unjust. The Portuguese, in the Indian Sea, took certain Turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved, and it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another, and making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in the place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves, their masters, and the vessel to ashes. We here touch the out-plate and utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as in virtue. Keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so subtle and cunning. Remember the Tuscan proverb:—

          Chi troppo s'assottiglia, si scavezza.

         ""Who makes himself too wise, becomes a fool.""
I advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as in your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and temperate, and avoid novelty; I am an enemy to all extravagant ways. You, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the advantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may with the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given this charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after a better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. But here is as much as you will stand in need of.

Epicurus said of the laws, ""That the worst were so necessary for us that without them men would devour one another."" And Plato affirms, ""That without laws we should live like beasts."" Our wit is a wandering, dangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or measure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare excellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding, we see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and manners; and 'tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable. 'Tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest limits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have its steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its inquisition be bounded by art. It is curbed and fettered by religions, laws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. And yet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and dissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to seize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound or held. In earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well descended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can with moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own judgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient to put them under pupilage. Wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the possessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a beast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks down and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and there out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him. And therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten path, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this unbridled liberty. But if any of these new doctors will pretend to be ingenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his own, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your way to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity, will prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from offending either you or your company.

The liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced in philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions, every one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick to and maintain. But now that men go all one way, Qui certis quibusdam destinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu non probant, cogantur defendere, ""Who are so tied and obliged to certain opinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,"" and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the schools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and discipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really worth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common approbation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how much it is current for. In like manner all things pass; we take physic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments, and love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead, prognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the philosophers' stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner of scruple or contradiction. We need to know no more but that Mars' house is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of Venus in the thumb, and that of Mercury in the little finger; that when the table-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger 'tis a sign of cruelty, that when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural median-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, 'tis a sign of a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and does not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not be very chaste. I leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such knowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies.

Theophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might judge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being arrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by reason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. 'Tis a moderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct us to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures of power, beyond which 'tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is plausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but 'tis hard to limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop at a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that, wherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to one age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are not cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often handling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form; what my force cannot discover, I do not yet desist to sound and to try; and by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by turning and heating it, I lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind of facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and supple for him,

               Ut hymettia sole
         Cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas
          Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;

              ""As wax doth softer in the sun become,
          And, tempered 'twixt the finger and the thumb,
         Will varions forms, and several shapes admit,
         Till for the present use 'tis rendered fit;""
as much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that the difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as little; for 'tis nothing but my own.

Man is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as Theophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once surrender all the rest of his knowledge; if he is defective in foundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other aim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he runs into an infinite irresolution. Non potest aliud alio magis minusve comprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:

""One thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because the definition of comprehending all things is the same."" Now 'tis very likely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place know itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own body and case, before any thing else. If we see the gods of physic to this very day debating about our anatomy,

         Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troj stabat Apollo;

         ""Vulcan against, for Troy Apollo stood;""
when are we to expect that they will be agreed? We are nearer neighbours to ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. If man do not know himself, how should he know his force and functions? It is not, perhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but 'tis by chance; forasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after the same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to distinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood.

The Academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it too crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white than black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone, thrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. And to avoid this difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our imagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of knowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not to be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be more likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty, that they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another, they allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. The Pyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this academic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than another, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent truth in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the form, lineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as by halves, springing and imperfect This appearance of likelihood, which makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments it; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to a hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the balance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one entire truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be swayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? How should they know the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? Either we can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot If our intellectual and sensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull and drive, 'tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried away with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they may seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our understanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and inflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: Inter visa, vera aut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest: ""Amongst things that seem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the mind."" That things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and do not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we sufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after the same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with the healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the same hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign subjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as we please. Now if on our part we received any thing without alteration, if human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our own means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be conveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there would be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as there are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent; but this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and controverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that our natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for my judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which is a sign that I seized it by some other means than by a natural power that is in me and in all other men.

Let us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even amongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal dispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed, that men, I mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts, are not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads; for they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they who deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not comprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions are, without comparison, the stronger in number.

Besides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that our judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is sensible of in himself, 'tis easy to perceive that its seat is very unstable and insecure. How variously do we judge of things?—How often do we alter our opinions? What I hold and believe to-day I hold and believe with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and take hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least as much as in them lies; I could not embrace nor conserve any truth with greater confidence and assurance than I do this; I am wholly and entirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once, but a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other thing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which I have since judged to be false? A man must at least become wise at his own expense; if I have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if my touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what assurance can I now have more than at other times? Is it not stupidity and madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide? Nevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from place to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into our belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the present and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must abandon goods, honour, life, health, and all.

    Posterior.... res ilia reperta
         Perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qnqne.

         ""The last things we find out are always best,
          And make us to disrelish all the rest.""
Whatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still remember that it is man that gives and man that receives; 'tis a mortal hand that presents it to us; 'tis a mortal hand that accepts it The things that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of persuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our own eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image could not abide in so wretched a habitation if God for this end did not prepare it, if God did not by his particular and supernatural grace and favour fortify and reform it. At least our frail and defective condition ought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation in our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we receive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false, and that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the lie and are so often deceived.

Now it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being so easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. It is certain that our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in general, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body, which alterations are continual. Are not our minds more sprightly, ou memories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health than in sickness? Do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects that present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and melancholy? Do you believe that Catullus's verses, or those of Sappho, please an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man? Cleomenes, the son of Anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached him that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed; ""I believe it,"" said he; ""neither am I the same man now as when I am in health; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other than they were before."" In our courts of justice this word is much in use, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good humour, gentle, and mild, Gaudeat de bon fortun ; ""Let him rejoice in his good fortune;"" for it is most certain that men's judgments are sometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at others more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with him from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man, having his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted but that his judgment will lean this way. That venerable senate of the Areopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight of the parties might corrupt their justice. The very air itself, and the serenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these verses in Cicero:—

              Tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse
         Jupiter auctifer lustravit lampade terras.

              ""Men's minds are influenc'd by th' external air,
         Dark or serene, as days are foul or fair.""
'Tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our judgments,—the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to doubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever can overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure alter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of our understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle it; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man's whole life wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our bodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so many several sorts of springs, that I believe the physicians, that it is hard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.

As to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself, unless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always lame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and therefore 'tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. I always call that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself reason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred contrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead and of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases, and to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how to turn and mould it. How uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he does not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to friendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things of that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour one thing more than another, and that, without reason's permission, puts the choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like vanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or disfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.

I, that watch myself as narrowly as I can, and that have my eyes continually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do elsewhere,

              Quis sub Arcto Rex gelid metuatur or,
         Quid Tyridatem terreat, unice Securus,

              ""I care not whom the northern clime reveres,
         Or what's the king that Tyridates fears,""
dare hardly tell the vanity and weakness I find in myself My foot is so unstable and unsteady, I find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my sight so disordered, that, fasting, I am quite another man than when full; if health and a fair day smile upon me, I am a very affable, good-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, I am sullen, out of humour, and not to be seen. The same pace of a horse seems to me one while hard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another longer; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: I am one while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all; and what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. I have a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either I am possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private authority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, I am as merry as a cricket. When I take a book in hand I have then discovered admirable graces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let me light upon them at another time, I may turn and toss, tumble and rattle the leaves to no purpose; 'tis then to me an inform and undiscovered mass. Even in my own writings I do not always find the air of my first fancy; I know not what I would have said, and am often put to it to correct and pump for a new sense, because I have lost the first that was better. I do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not always advance—it floats and roams:—

              Velut minuta magno
         Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.

             ""Like a small bark that's tost upon the main.
         When winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain.""
Very often, as I am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an opinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that way, does so engage me that way that I no more discern the reason of my former belief, and forsake it I am, as it were, misled by the side to which I incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight. Every one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself as I do. Preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon them in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we are more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper impression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation than we do in our colder and more temperate state. You only give your counsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and uncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes. Have you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin to be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in your quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your cause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his understanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in good earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. Nay, I do not know whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against the power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of reputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the opinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have burned a finger. The shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the body's passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more; to which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has no other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the agitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a ship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied their assistance. And whoever should maintain this, siding with the Peripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known that the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and stand in need of, this impulse of the passions. Valour, they say, cannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; Semper Ajax fortis, fortissimus tamen in furore; ""Ajax was always brave, but most when in a fury:"" neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously enough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire the judges with indignation, to obtain justice.

Irregular desires moved Themistocles, and Demosthenes, and have pushed on the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us to honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. And this meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed remorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of the scourge of God, and politic correction for the chastisement of our offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of preserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many brave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! In short, there is no brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. May not this be one of the reasons that moved the Epicureans to discharge God from all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of his goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its repose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments pricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought otherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul from her tranquillity? Ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null, ne minima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: Sic animi quietus et placatus status cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.. ""As it is understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air stirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased when there is no perturbation to move it.""

What varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations does the diversity of our passions inspire us with! What assurance then can we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition to the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and borrowed pace? If our judgment be in the power even of sickness and perturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the impression of things, what security can we expect from it?

Is it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the greatest actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they are furious, mad, and beside themselves? We better ourselves by the privation of our reason, and drilling it. The two natural ways to enter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of destiny, are fury and sleep.

This is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause in our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by madness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. I was never so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. 'Tis a pure enthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy, which makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most calm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can seat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than sleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more than our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves. But does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider that the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so clear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so terrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit of dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not to be trusted and believed?

I, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of these vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a sudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. But the passion that is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men, though it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does evidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the violence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. I have formerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for I am so far from being one of those that invite vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if they do not haul me along; I perceived it to spring, grow, and increase, in spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was, wholly to seize and possess me. So that, as if rousing from drunkenness, the images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used to be; I evidently saw the advantages of the object I desired, grow, and increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the difficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my reason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated in an instant, as from a flash of lightning, I was aware that my soul resumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment; the difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same things had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had presented them to me; which of the two most truly? Pyrrho knows nothing about it. We are never without sickness. Agues have their hot and cold fits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering; as much as I had advanced, so much I retired:—

              Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,
         Nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam
         Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;
         Nunc rapidus retro, atque stu revoluta resorbens
         Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.

              ""So swelling surges, with a thundering roar,
         Driv'n on each others' backs, insult the shore,
         Bound o'er the rocks, encroach upon the land,
         And far upon the beach heave up the sand;
         Then backward rapidly they take their way,
         Repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea.""
Now, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, I have accidentally begot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much altered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance soever there may be in novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of losing by the bargain; and, as I am not capable of choosing, I take other men's choice, and keep myself in the station wherein God has placed me; I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling. Thus have I, by the grace of God, preserved myself entire, without anxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion, amidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. The writings of the ancients, the best authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt and carry me which way almost they will; he that I am reading seems always to have the most force; and I find that every one in his turn is in the right, though they contradict one another. The facility that good wits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and that nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour enough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the weakness of their testimony. The heavens and the stars have been three thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief till Cleanthes the Samian, or, according to Theophrastus, Nicetas of Syracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that moved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac. And Copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very regularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we make of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true opinion? And who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may over throw the two former.

              Sic volvenda tas commutt tempora rerum:
         Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;
         Porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,
         Inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum
         Laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.

               ""Thus ev'ry thing is changed in course of time,
          What now is valued passes soon its prime;
         To which some other thing, despised before,
          Succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;
         And once received, too faint all praises seem,
         So highly it is rais'd in men's esteem.""
So that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great reason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot, the contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been overthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start up which may damn the second. Before the principles that Aristotle introduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason, as these satisfy us now. What patent have these people, what particular privilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and that the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them? They are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their predecessors were. When any one presses me with a new argument, I ought to believe that what I cannot answer another can; for to believe all likelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would by that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the vulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their souls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance, must of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last still effacing all footsteps of that which went before. He that finds himself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak with his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received his instruction. How long is it that physic has been practised in the world? 'Tis said that a new comer, called Paracelsus, changes and overthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till now, it has been of no other use but to kill men. I believe he will easily make this good, but I do not think it were wisdom to venture my life in making trial of his own experience. We are not to believe every one, says the precept, because every one can say all things. A man of this profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since told me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature and motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if I would give him the hearing. After I had with some patience heard his arguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: ""What, then,"" said I, ""did those that sailed according to Theophrastus make way westward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward or backward?"" ""That's fortune,"" answered he, ""but so it is that they were mistaken."" I replied that I had rather follow effects than reason. Now these are things that often interfere with one another, and I have been told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest point of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations found which subvert the truth of all experience; as Jacques Pelletier told me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching themselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he affirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one another. And the Pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and their reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and 'tis a wonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this design of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we do not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor heat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely things. Ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this world of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure of it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge; it had been Pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of cosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it was heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours, there is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or single country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness to that we knew before. The geographers of our time stick not to assure us that now all is found; all is seen:—

         Nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;

         ""What's present pleases, and appears the best;""
but it remains to be seen whether, as Ptolemy was therein formerly deceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to trust now in what these people say? And whether it is not more likely that this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another thing than what we imagine.

Plato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the heavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions retrograde to what we see, changing east into west The Egyptian priests told Herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven thousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all their kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times altered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change into one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined; Aristotle and Cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of opinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again by several vicissitudes; calling Solomon and Isaiah to witness; to evade those oppositions, that God has once been a creator without a creature; that he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by putting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to change. In the most famous of the Greek schools the world is taken for a god, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a soul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to his circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great, infinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth, the stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual agitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from one another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their order, one while before, and another behind. Heraclitus was positive that the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny, was one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again renewed. And Apuleius says of men: Sigillatim mortales, cunctim perpetui. ""That they are mortal in particular, and immortal in general."" Alexander writ to his mother the narration of an Egyptian priest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that nation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other countries. Cicero and Diodorus say that in their time the Chaldees kept a register of four hundred thousand and odd years, Aristotle, Pliny, and others, that Zoroaster flourished six thousand years before Plato's time. Plato says that they of the city of Sais have records in writing of eight thousand years; and that the city of Athens was built a thousand years before the said city of Sais; Epicurus, that at the same time things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the same manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with greater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new discovered world of the West Indies with ours, present and past, in so many strange examples.

In earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course of this terrestrial polity, I have often wondered to see in so vast a distance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of popular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by no means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. The human mind is a great worker of miracles! But this relation has, moreover, I know not what of extraordinary in it; 'tis found to be in names, also, and a thousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we know, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were states and great civil governments maintained by women only, without men; where our fasts and Lent were represented, to which was added abstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute; here they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there they were erected, and particularly that of St Andrew, to protect themselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of infants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood, of very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this a great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our penance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art of divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all sorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating in a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the first god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they were created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have since been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory changed, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of old overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few families escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths of which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut up, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they perceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean and wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards sending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to repeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. In one place we met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were marvellously displeased at the Spaniards for discomposing the bones of the dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones so disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no other way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people for the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry, according to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in gardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms, tennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager and hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise than by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one first man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one God, who formerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence, preaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that vanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants; the custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking to the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men's skulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present themselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or master; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no part being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon promotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to take upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another to strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:

""From dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;"" as also the art of augury. The vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in some of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. It is not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this side of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians also, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the belief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire they give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by the rigour of an excessive coldness. And this example puts me in mind of another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who delighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off the prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others who made so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed it up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air; and of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and festivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express their disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present themselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace, throw some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end that all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. But to proceed:—

If nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the beliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things; if they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like cabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure, what magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? If we experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air, upon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the colour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover the very faculties of the soul itself: Et plaga codi non solum ad robor corporum, sed etiam anirum facit: ""The climate is of great efficacy, not only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,"" says Vegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of Athens chose to situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as the Egyptian priests told Solon: Athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam acutiores putantur Attici; crassum Thebis; itaque pingues Thebani, et valentes: ""The air of Athens is subtle and thin; whence also the Athenians are reputed to be more acute; and at Thebes more gross and thick; wherefore the Thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and more strong."" In such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different, men are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here given to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to superstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another to servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious, obedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they are seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like trees, which was the reason why Cyrus would not grant the Persians leave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another more pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made men effeminate and soft. If we see one while one art and one belief flourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence; such an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and such a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray, like our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so soothe ourselves withal? Seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a hundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature itself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what assurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this very age of ours she is not so?

Methinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought not to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find out what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and wish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content us. Let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at pleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy itself:—

              Quid enim ratione timemus,
          Aut cupimus? Quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te
         Conatus non poniteat, votique peracti?

              ""For what, with reason, do we speak or shun,
         What plan, how happily soe'r begun,
         That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?""
And therefore it was that Socrates only begged of the gods that they would give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private and public prayer of the Lacedemonians was simply for good and useful things, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of the Supreme Power:—

              Conjugium petimus, partumqu uxoris; at illis
         Notum, qui pueri, qualisque futura sit uxor:

              ""We ask for Wives and children; they above
         Know only, when we have them, what they'll prove;""
and Christians pray to God, ""Thy will be done,"" that they may not fall into the inconvenience the poet feigns of King Midas. He prayed to the gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; his prayer was heard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his bed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself overwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an intolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers.

              Attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque,
         Effugere optt opes, et, qu modo voverat, odit.

              ""Astonished at the strangeness of the ill,
         To be so rich, yet miserable still;
         He wishes now he could his wealth evade,
         And hates the thing for which before he prayed.""
To instance in myself: being young, I desired of fortune, above all things, the order of St. Michael, which was then the utmost distinction of honour amongst the French nobles, and very rare. She pleasantly gratified my longing; instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my own place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it so low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and lower. Cleobis and Bito, Trophonius and Agamedes, having requested, the first of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of their piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly opinions concerning what is fit for us. God might grant us riches, honours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that is pleasing to us is not always good for us. If he sends us death, or an increase of sickness, instead of a cure, Vvrga tua et baculus, tuus ipsa me consolata sunt. ""Thy rod and thy staff have comforted me,"" he does it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly discerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it in good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand

              Si consilium vis:
         Permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid
         Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris...
         Carior est illis homo quam sibi;

              ""If thou'lt be rul'd, to th' gods thy fortunes trust,
         Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just.
         What best may profit or delight they know,
         And real good, for fancied bliss, bestow;
         With eyes of pity, they our frailties scan,
         More dear to them, than to himself, is man;""
for to require of him honours and commands, is to require 'that he may throw you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of the like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit doubtful.

There is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers, as about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the calculation of Varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. Qui autem de summo bono dissentit, de tot philosophies ratione disputt. ""For whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme good, disputes upon the whole matter of philosophy.""

              Trs mihi conviv prope dissentire videntur,
         Poscentes vario mul turn divers a palato;
         Quid dem? Quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet alter;
         Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus;

              ""I have three guests invited to a feast,
         And all appear to have a different taste;
         What shall I give them? What shall I refuse?
         What one dislikes the other two shall choose;
         And e'en the very dish you like the best
         Is acid or insipid to the rest:""
nature should say the same to their contests and debates. Some say that our well-being lies in virtue, others in pleasure, others in submitting to nature; one in knowledge, another in being exempt from pain, another in not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances; and this fancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient Pythagoras,

              Nil admirari, prope res est una, Numici,
         Solaque, qu possit facere et servare beatum:

              ""Not to admire's the only art I know
         Can make us happy, and can keep us so;""
which is the drift of the Pyrrhonian sect; Aristotle attributes the admiring nothing to magnanimity; and Arcesilaus said, that constancy and a right inflexible state of judgment were the true good, and consent and application the sin and evil; and there, it is true, in being thus positive, and establishing a certain axiom, he quitted Pyrrhonism; for the' Pyrrhonians, when they say that ataraxy, which is the immobility of judgment, is the sovereign good, do not design to speak it affirmatively; but that the same motion of soul which makes them avoid precipices, and take shelter from the cold, presents them such a fancy, and makes them refuse another.

How much do I wish that, whilst I live, either some other or Justus Lipsius, the most learned man now living, of a most polite and judicious understanding, truly resembling my Turnebus, had both the will and health, and leisure sufficient, carefully and conscientiously to collect into a register, according to their divisions and classes, as many as are to be found, of the opinions of the ancient philosophers, about the subject of our being and manners, their controversies, the succession and reputation of sects; with the application of the lives of the authors and their disciples to their own precepts, in memorable accidents, and upon exemplary occasions. What a beautiful and useful work that would be!

As to what remains, if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the rules of our manners, upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves! For that which our reason advises us to, as the most likely, is generally for every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of Socrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel; and by that, what would it say, but that our duty has no other rule but what is accidental? Truth ought to have a like and universal visage; if man could know equity and justice that had a body and a true being, he would not fetter it to the conditions of this country or that; it would not be from the whimsies of the Persians or Indians that virtue would receive its form. There is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than the laws; since I was born, I have known those of the English, our neighbours, three or four times changed, not only in matters of civil regimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed with, but in the most important subject that can be, namely, religion, at which I am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with whom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and acquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our ancient kindred; and here with us at home, I have known a thing that was capital to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise, according to the chance of war, in a possibility of being one day found guilty of high-treason, both divine and human, should the justice of our arms fall into the power of injustice, and, after a few years' possession, take a quite contrary being. How could that ancient god more clearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine Being, and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of their own contrivance, useful as a bond to their society, than declaring as he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every one's true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he chanced to be? O God, what infinite obligation have we to the bounty of our sovereign Creator, for having disabused our belief from these wandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the eternal foundation of his holy word? But what then will philosophers say to us in this necessity? ""That we follow the laws of our country;"" that is to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince, that will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it as many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; I cannot suffer my judgment to be so flexible. What kind of virtue is that which I see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which the crossing of a river makes a crime? What sort of truth can that be, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world beyond them?

But they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they say, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call natural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own proper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some less; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest Now they are so unfortunate, (for what can I call it else but misfortune that, of so infinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least that fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally received by the consent of all nations?) they are, I say, so miserable, that of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one that is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by many. Now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some natural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without doubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained us; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the force and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to any thing contrary to this law. But let them produce me one of this condition. Proctagoras and Aristo gave no other essence to the justice of laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that, these laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and remained empty names of indifferent things; Thrasymachus, in Plato, is of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the superior. There is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in laws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in esteem, as in Lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near relations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in honour:—

              Gentes esse ferantur,
         In quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti
         Jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;

              ""There are some nations in the world, 'tis said,
         Where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed;
         And their affections thereby higher rise,
         More firm and constant by these double ties;""
the murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives, traffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short, there is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some nation or other.

It is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them in other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason everywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle and confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and inconstancy: Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico, artis est: ""Therefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours belongs to art."" Subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations, and thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation considers a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in a different point of view.

There is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat his father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do, looked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to give their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing up in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies and relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by transmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and digestion. It is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it must have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition to throw their fathers' remains to the corruption of the earth, and the nourishment of beasts and worms.

Lycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and dexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit that redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly to the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this double institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made for military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to which he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the disorder and injustice of taking another man's goods.

Dionysius, the tyrant, offered Plato a robe of the Persian fashion, long, damasked, and perfumed; Plato refused it, saying, ""That being born a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women's clothes;"" but Aristippus accepted it with this answer, ""That no accoutrement could corrupt a chaste courage."" His friends reproaching him with meanness of spirit, for laying it no more to heart that Dionysius had spit in his face, ""Fishermen,"" said he, ""suffer themselves to be drenched with the waves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon."" Diogenes was washing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, ""If thou couldst live on cabbage,"" said he, ""thou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;"" to whom Aristippus replied, ""And if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou wouldst not be washing cabbages."" Thus reason finds appearances for divers effects; 'tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the right or left:—

              Bellum, o terra hospita, portas:
         Bello armantur eqni; bellum hc armenta minantur.
         Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti
         Quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;
         Spes est pacis.

         ""War, war is threatened from this foreign ground
               (My father cried), where warlike steeds are found.
         Yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,
         And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,
         Peace may succeed to war.""
Solon, being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and unprofitable tears for the death of his son, ""It is for that reason that I the more justly shed them,"" said he, ""because they are powerless and unprofitable."" Socrates's wife exasperated her grief by this circumstance: ""Oh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to death!"" ""Why,"" replied he, ""hadst thou rather they should execute me justly?"" We have our ears bored; the Greeks looked upon that as a mark of slavery. We retire in private to enjoy our wives; the Indians do it in public. The Scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere temples were a refuge:—

               Inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum
         Odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos
         Esse deos, quos ipse colit.

              ""Thus 'tis the popular fury that creates
         That all their neighbours' gods each nation hates;
         Each thinks its own the genuine; in a word,
         The only deities to be adored.""
I have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt Bartolus and Aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties, writ in the margin of his book, ""a question for a friend;"" that is to say, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like cause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit 'Twas only for want of wit that he did not write ""a question for a friend"" throughout. The advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes to accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. In so infinite a science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so arbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme confusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear wherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined one way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that at another time. Of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that practice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the ceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one sentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide one and the same cause.

As to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue, 'tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions that are better concealed than published to weak minds. Arcesilaus said, ""That in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:"" Et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut ordine, sed forma, otate, jigur, metiendas Epicurus putat.... ne amores quidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... Queeramus, ad quam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint. ""And obscene pleasures, if nature requires them,"" Epicurus thinks, ""are not to be measured either by race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... Neither are sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to inquire till what age young men are to be loved."" These last two stoical quotations, and the reproach that Dicarchus threw into the teeth of Plato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy indulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom.

Laws derive their authority from possession and custom. 'Tis dangerous to trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble themselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to their source, 'tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,

that swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. Do but consult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this famous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find them so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh and reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or upon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from those of the public. It is no wonder if people, who take their pattern from the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve from the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have approved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them have been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would refuse our ceremonies. Chrysippus said, ""That a philosopher would make a dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of olives.""
That philosopher would hardly have advised Clisthenes to have refused Hippoclides the fair Agarista his daughter, for having seen him stand on his head upon a table. Metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke wind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory in his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till Crates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons the example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should sound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own stoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the Peripatetics, of which he had been till then. That which we call decency, not to dare to do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the Stoics call foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and disown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our actions, they reputed a vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the mysteries of Venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose them to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind the curtain was to debase them. Modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy, reservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. Pleasure did very ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be prostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to the public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private cabinets. Hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to disperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but moreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this vice:—

              Mochus es Aufidi, qui vir,
         Scvine, fuisti:
         Rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.
          Cur alina placet tibi, qu tua non placet uxor?
         Numquid securus non potes arrigere?
This experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:—

              Nullus in urbe fuit tot, qui tangere vellet
         Uxorem gratis, Cciliane, tuam,
         Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens
         Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.
A philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing, coldly replied, ""I am planting man;"" no more blushing to be so caught than if they had found him planting garlic.

It is, I suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty of mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act is so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade himself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent embraces of the Cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent lascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school's profession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained, it was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. But he had not thoroughly examined their debauches; for Diogenes, playing the beast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw him, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. To those who asked him why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than in the open street, he made answer, ""Because I am hungry in the open street."" The women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also with their persons, in all places, without reservation; and Hipparchia was not received into Crates's society, but upon condition that she should, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule. These philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other discipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed the sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the laws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and the conservation of the liberty of others.

Heraclitus and Protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick, and pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight when out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects, argued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these appearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some sympathy with the sick man's taste, and the rudder some bending quality sympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all the rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently, nothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.

This opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is no sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight or crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it undertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect words that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we suggested! What heresy has not there found ground and testimony sufficient to make itself embraced and defended! 'Tis for this that the authors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of the interpretation of words. A person of dignity, who would approve to me, by authority, the search of the philosopher's stone, wherein he was head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six passages of the Bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt, for the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth, the idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to the defence of this fine science.

By this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. There is no fortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the pains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and glosses of his words, he may make him, like the Sibyls, say what he will. There are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but that, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will find out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose; therefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and ancient use. Let the author but make himself master of that, to busy posterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the accidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to the rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner, somewhat obscurely or contradictorily, 'tis no matter;—a number of wits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several forms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to it, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched by the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their pupils yearly presents. This it is which has given reputation to many things of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue, and given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be desired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand images and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.

Is it possible that Homer could design to say all that we make him say, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the divines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men who treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should indifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority, as the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans, and counsellor-general of all enterprises? Whoever has had occasion for oracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn. 'Tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent person, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour of our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was Homer's design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as any man whatever of his time. And what he has found in favour of our religion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. Do but observe how Plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling his own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what side they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new opinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different course of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow, according to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age, because they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power, according to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter. From the same foundation that Heraclitus and this sentence of his had, ""that all things had in them those forms that we discern,"" Democritus drew quite a contrary conclusion,—""that objects have in them nothing that we discern in them;"" and because honey is sweet to one and bitter to another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The Pyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter, or whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained the highest point of dubitation. The Cyrenaics held that nothing was perceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that inwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound nor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and that man's judgment had no other seat Protagoras believed that ""what seems true to every one, is true to every one."" The Epicureans lodged all judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in pleasure. Plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself, derived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and cogitation.

This discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which lies the greatest foundation and Prof of our ignorance. Whatsoever is known, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the judgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, 'tis reason that this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the constraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the power, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is conveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:—

                Via qua munita fidei
          Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;

              ""It is the surest path that faith can find
         By which to enter human heart and mind.""
Science begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should know no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour, light, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour, smoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles of the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science is nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses, would have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The senses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:—

               Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam
          Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....
           Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?

              ""Of truth, whate'er discoveries are made,
          Are by the senses to us first conveyed;
         Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what
         Can we rely more safely than on that?""
Let us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of necessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that all our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having attempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to himself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he could not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained the contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and arguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore thus cried out against him: ""O miserable! thy force has destroyed thee."" There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that fire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no weight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the senses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be compared to that for certainty.

The first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I make a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I see several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without sight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two, three, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be wanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. 'Tis the privilege of the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing beyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense in the discovery of another:—

                 An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures
            Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?
          An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?

                ""Can ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?
           Or is that touch by tasting to be check'd?
          Or th' other senses, shall the nose or eyes
           Confute in their peculiar faculties?""
They all make the extremest limits of our ability:—

               Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,

              ""Each has its power distinctly and alone,
         And every sense's power is its own.""
It is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not see; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for which reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul's being contented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot be sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any such thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either by reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination with any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there's nothing remains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that are born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they understand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want something; that there is something to be desired that we have, which they can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet they know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.

I have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little sensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for seeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own. They brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken into his arms, ""Good God,"" said he, ""what a fine child! How beautiful to look upon! what a pretty face it has!"" He will say, like one of us, ""This room has a very fine prospect;—it is clear weather;—the sun shines bright."" And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are our exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will ride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we have; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us all, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. One cries out to him, ""Here's a hare!"" when he is upon some even plain where he may safely ride; and afterwards, when they tell him, ""The hare is killed,"" he will be as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will take a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket; he will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what his people tell him, that he is over, or wide.

Who knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want of some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of the face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the difficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence; and that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not produced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether some of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than ours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness, smoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides these, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any reference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in nature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the occult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract iron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we are ignorant of the true essence of such things? 'Tis perhaps some particular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at midnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow accordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of the matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though birds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile quality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to arm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the one, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the other; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear and the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag, elephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for their cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that does not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. If we were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the voice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our science; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense, how many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other things, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man imagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing, and consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon him, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that of how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such another sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be. We have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five senses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight or ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.

The sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the uncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is by their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their report, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the light which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage, we have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these fancies proceed: ""That every subject has in itself all we there find. That it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;"" and that of the Epicureans, ""That the sun is no bigger than 'tis judged by our sight to be:—""

                Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,
         Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:

              ""But be it what it will in our esteems,
         It is no bigger than to us it seems:""
that the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near, and less to him that is more remote, are both true:—

              Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....
         Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:

              ""Yet that the eye's deluded we deny;
         Charge not the mind's faults, therefore, on the eye:""
""and, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to lie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference and contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and other flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses."" Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never perceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so proceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. The most absurd of all absurdities, with the Epicureans, is to deny the force and effect of the senses:—

                  Proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est
            Et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,
            Cur ea, qu fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint
            Visa rotunda; tamen prstat rationis egentem
            Beddere mendose causas utriusque figur,
           Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere ququam,
            Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota
            Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:
            Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa
           Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,
            Procipitesque locos vitare, et ctera, qu sint
           In genere hoc fugienda.

                ""That what we see exists I will maintain,
          And if our feeble reason can't explain
            Why things seem square when they are very near,
            And at a greater distance round appear;
           'Tis better yet, for him that's at a pause,
          'T' assign to either figure a false cause,
          Than shock his faith, and the foundations rend
         On which our safety and our life depend:
         For reason not alone, but life and all,
         Together will with sudden ruin fall;
         Unless we trust our senses, nor despise
         To shun the various dangers that arise.""
This so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,—that human knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable, foolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater value upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever, than to confess his necessary ignorance—a truth so disadvantageous to him. He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords of his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all circumstances; 'tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and if his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with obstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say be true, viz: ""that we have no knowledge if the senses' appearances be false;"" and if that also be true which the Stoics say, ""that the appearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no manner of knowledge,"" we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these two great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.

As to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every one may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary are the faults and tricks they put upon us. In the echo of a valley the sound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:—

              Exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,
         Classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem
         Apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens
         Insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...
         Et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,
         Qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....
         Ubi in medio nobis equus acer obhsit
         Flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur
         Vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.

               ""And rocks i' th' seas that proudly raise their head,
         Though far disjoined, though royal navies spread,
         Their sails between; yet if from distance shown,
         They seem an island all combin'd in one.
         Thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,
         Seem fix'd to sailors; those seem under sail
         That ride at anchor safe; and all admire,
         As they row by, to see the rocks retire.
         Thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,
         And I look'd downward on the rolling flood;
         Though he stood still, I thought he did divide
         The headlong streams, and strive against the tide,
         And all things seem'd to move on every side.""
Take a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped over it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade himself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of them one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of our reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and knows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the sense of feeling, that has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so often, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and overthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry out of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his soul—""That the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent things, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign felicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue."" There is no heart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets will not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our music will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will not feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy vastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our ceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace and devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt feel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that makes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think myself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a beautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say ""that the voice was the flower of beauty."" One would once make me believe that a certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in repeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon paper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary judgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion and value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the voice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing one giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and breaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, ""I break what is thine, because thou corruptest what is mine."" To what end did those men who have, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their faces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed? And that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to be made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of the preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that the sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these proper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the imagination? 'Tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were borrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from Spain, and this pearl-powder from the Ocean Sea. Our sight will, nevertheless, compel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely against all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:—

               Auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur
         Crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.
         Spe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:
         Decipit hac oculos gide dives Amor.

               ""By dress we're won; gold, gems, and rich brocades
          Make up the pageant that your heart invades;
          In all that glittering figure which you see,
         The far least part of her own self is she;
         In vain for her you love amidst such cost
         You search, the mistress in such dress is lost.""
What a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make Narcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow,

              Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;
         Se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;
         Dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:

              ""Admireth all; for which to be admired;
         And inconsiderately himself desir'd.
         The praises which he gives his beauty claim'd,
         Who seeks is sought, th' inflamer is inflam'd:""
and Pygmalion's judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight of his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living woman!

              Oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,
         Et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;
         Et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.

              ""He kisses, and believes he's kissed again;
         Seizes, and 'twixt his arms his love doth strain,
         And thinks the polish'd ivory thus held
         Doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,
         And has a timorous fear, lest black and blue
          Should in the parts with ardour press'd ensue.""
Put a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him on the top of the high tower of Notre Dame at Paris; he will see, by manifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find (unless he has been used to the plumber's trade) that he cannot help but the sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we have enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples, if they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some there are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a beam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to walk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the courage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often tried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am not the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into that infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above my length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen unless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the precipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a rock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our fears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in falling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are not to look upon without being giddy; Ut despici vine vertigine timid ocvlorum animique non possit: ""'To that one cannot look without dizziness;"" which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore it was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul from being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater liberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears, that Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for receiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally, should have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of his life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and reason: Fit etiam sope specie qudam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus, ut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor, ""For it often falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight, by the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also by grief and fear."" Physicians hold that there are certain complexions that are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I have seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without impatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the sharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron; as also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an impediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger and hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who softened, raised, and moved his master's voice whilst he declaimed at Rome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to move and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is wonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine piece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and accidents of so light a wind.

The same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in turn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie and contend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear when we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it is:—

               Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.

              ""Thebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns.""
The object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is;

              Multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus
         Esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;

              ""Hence 'tis that ugly things in fancied dress
         Seem gay, look fair to lovers' eyes, and please;""
and that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the light of the day seems dark and overcast. Our senses are not only depraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many things do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied with other thoughts?

               In rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,
         Si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni
         Tempore semot fuerint, longeque remot:

               ""Nay, even in plainest things, unless the mind
         Take heed, unless she sets herself to find,
         The thing no more is seen, no more belov'd,
         Than if the most obscure and most remov'd:""
it would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of the senses. And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of infirmity and falsehood.

They who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the right than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and exercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake; but more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the difference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian brightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps, here she slumbers; but, whether more or less, 'tis still dark, and Cimmerian darkness. We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so clearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear enough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound, sometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never so sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which are waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving those fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the actions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of the day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is not another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?

If the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to consult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than we; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick than man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that of touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the sensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of their senses and ours the difference is extreme. Our spittle cleanses and dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:—

              Tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,
          Ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.
         Spe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv,
         Disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:

               ""And in those things the difference is so great
         That what's one's poison is another's meat;
         For serpents often have been seen, 'tis said,
         When touch'd with human spittle, to go mad,
         And bite themselves to death:""
what quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves, or as it affects the serpent? By which of the two senses shall we prove the true essence that we seek for?

Pliny says there are certain sea-hares in the Indies that are poison to us, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill them. Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we believe, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the air infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox, but hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be the pestilent quality? To them who have the jaundice, all things seem yellow and paler than to us:—

              Lurida prterea fiunt, qucunque tuentur Arquati.

               ""Besides, whatever jaundic'd eyes do view
         Looks pale as well as those, and yellow too.""
They who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call hyposphagma—which is a suffusion of blood under the skin—see all things red and bloody. What do we know but that these humours, which thus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual with them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the jaundice; and others of a bloody colour; 'tis likely that the colours of objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make a right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a relation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have reference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and nature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down the eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more extended;—many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length, therefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our eyes give it in the usual state. If we close the lower part of the eye things appear double to us:—

               Bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...
         Et duplices hominum facis, et corpora bina.

              ""One lamp seems double, and the men appear
         Each on two bodies double heads to bear.""
If our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we receive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise, who have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an ear, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of sound. We see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass of a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the place appear to us green, yellow, or violet:—

              Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,
         Et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,
         Per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;
         Namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem
         Scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque
         Inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:

              ""Thus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,
         O'er all the spacious theatre are spread,
         Which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,
         And the loose curtains wanton in the air;
         Whole streams of colours from the summit flow,
         The rays divide them in their passage through,
         And stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:""
'tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers colours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes.

We should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of the senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves; which we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one hears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and contests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the images that the senses represent to us. A child, by the ordinary rule of nature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old; and he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and dusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously, according as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings which are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called endless feathers, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the deception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and come So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger; yet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our perception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a wonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us; but that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more than we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all the knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do our senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and embossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch. Shall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to the taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for one part o the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to the taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust, used in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the members they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please themselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the prize,—whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and great as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them little and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject with these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves, nevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but bread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and nails:—

                Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,
        Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;

                ""As meats, diffus'd through all the members, lose
        Their former state, and different things compose;""
the humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and fruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a thousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that, in like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or have they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can we determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of disease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than they do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it not likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our natural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things that have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to themselves, as well as when they are disordered;—that health is as capable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate a certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate? and why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other? He whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man commends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition always accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according to its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves, seeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the senses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all propositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides, must, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses renders every thing uncertain that they produce:—

                 Denique ut in fabric, si prava est rgula prima,
         Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,
         Et libella aliqu si ex parte claudicat hilum;
        Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,
        Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;
        Jam ruere ut qudam videantux'velle, ruantque
        Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;
        Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,
        Falsaque sit, falsis qucunque ab sensibus orta est.

                ""But lastly, as in building, if the line
        Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,
        Or level false, how vain is the design!
        Uneven, an ill-shap'd and tottering wall
        Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,
        Because the rules were false that fashion'd all;
        Thus reason's rules are false if all commence
        And rise from failing and from erring sense.""
As to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those differences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have a judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all choice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it falls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of old age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same exception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the same incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these propositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must have a judge that never was.

To judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t have a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have demonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here we are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing the senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty themselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be erected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we run back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that are strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the senses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions; by which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only of the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are different things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by another thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of the senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by resemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this resemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they who never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is like him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if it be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their contrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some select appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by another select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be any end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the objects' being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal things, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently nothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the judging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.

We have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is always in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure appearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if, perhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but like grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and hold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what you would grasp and hold. So, seeing that all things are subject to pass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real substance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing that is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either entering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die before it is bom. Plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but only birth; conceiving that Homer had made the Ocean and Thetis father and mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual fluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers, as he says, before his time, Parmenides only excepted, who would not allow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty value. Pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and unstable; the Stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we call so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the past; Heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river; Epichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe it now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to dinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more the same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal substance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness and quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another reunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be born never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth is never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed is evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first in the mother's womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a sucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man, and at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is always destroying and spoiling that which went before:—

             Mutt enira mundi naturam totius tas,
        Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;
        Nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,
        Omnia commutt natura, et vertere cogit.

            ""For time the nature of the world translates,
        And from preceding gives all things new states;
        Nought like itself remains, but all do range,
        And nature forces every thing to change.""
""And yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already passed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as Heraclitus said, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air generation of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in ourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is terminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth, and the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day will die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same state, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so let this be the proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that we are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? How comes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise or condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different affections, and no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? For it is not likely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that which suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the same it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it, unknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another thing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves, taking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing what that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is eternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have ending, and to which time can bring no mutation. For time is a mobile thine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing and running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which belong those words, before and after, has been, or shall be: which at the first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it were a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is not et being, or that has already ceased to be. And as to these words, present, instant, and now, by which it seems that we principally support and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does presently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the future and past, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The same happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it; for she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but all things are either born, bearing, or dying. So that it were sinful to say of God, who is he only who is, that he was, or that he shall be ; for those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of what cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude that God alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according to an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor subject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom nothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that with one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that truly is but he alone; without our being able to say, he has been, or shall be; without beginning, and without end."" To this so religious conclusion of a pagan I shall only add this testimony of one of the same condition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would furnish me with endless matter: ""What a vile and abject thing,"" says he, ""is man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!"" 'Tis a good word and a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle bigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope to stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and monstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he cannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. He shall be exalted, if God will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt himself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by suffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial. It belongs to our Christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to pretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis.1Embed"

Will appear a more desirable design
So far from what i was
So close to what i could be
Abandoning past reflections
I will not miss me
No longer ruled by imperfections
I will not miss me
And now i am invincible
So fucking invincible
Just try and fucking stop me

A frame once rendered frail
Now suddenly superhuman
Incapable of doubt
A structure free from flaws

An immovable mass
Of sentinel contruction
So far from what i was
So close to what i could be

Nothing matters anymore

Untouchable unstoppable

I vow to purge you both of your warmest thoughts
And strike you down with this hateful gaze
With these words i wish you the worst
With these words i promise poison
Beware this bitter breath
For it brings arsenic
Beware this artic stare
For it will pierce you like icicles

Cold and comfortable in these sour times

v.
FLORES, ARCHBISHOP OF SAN ANTONIO, et al.No. 95-2074.United States Supreme Court.
Argued February 19, 1997.
Decided June 25, 1997.
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT*509 *509 Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C. J., and Stevens, Thomas, and Ginsburg, JJ., joined, and in which Scalia, J., joined as to all but Part IIIA-1. Stevens, J., filed a concurring opinion, post, p. 536. Scalia, J., filed an opinion concurring in part, in which Stevens, J., joined, post, p. 537. O'Connor, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Breyer, J., joined except as to the first paragraph of Part I, post, p. 544. Souter, J., post, p. 565, and Breyer, J., post, p. 566, filed dissenting opinions.

*511Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.[*]A decision by local zoning authorities to deny a church a building permit was challenged under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA or Act), 107 Stat. 1488, 42 U. S. C.  2000bb et seq. The case calls into question the authority of Congress to enact RFRA. We conclude the statute exceeds Congress' power.ISituated on a hill in the city of Boerne, Texas, some 28 miles northwest of San Antonio, is St. Peter Catholic Church. Built in 1923, the church's structure replicates the mission *512 style of the region's earlier history. The church seats about 230 worshippers, a number too small for its growing parish. Some 40 to 60 parishioners cannot be accommodated at some Sunday masses. In order to meet the needs of the congregation the Archbishop of San Antonio gave permission to the parish to plan alterations to enlarge the building.

A few months later, the Boerne City Council passed an ordinance authorizing the city's Historic Landmark Commission to prepare a preservation plan with proposed historic landmarks and districts. Under the ordinance, the commission must preapprove construction affecting historic landmarks or buildings in a historic district.
Soon afterwards, the Archbishop applied for a building permit so construction to enlarge the church could proceed. City authorities, relying on the ordinance and the designation of a historic district (which, they argued, included the church), denied the application. The Archbishop brought this suit challenging the permit denial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. 877 F. Supp. 355 (1995).

The complaint contained various claims, but to this point the litigation has centered on RFRA and the question of its constitutionality. The Archbishop relied upon RFRA as one basis for relief from the refusal to issue the permit. The District Court concluded that by enacting RFRA Congress exceeded the scope of its enforcement power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court certified its order for interlocutory appeal and the Fifth Circuit reversed, finding RFRA to be constitutional. 73 F. 3d 1352 (1996). We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and now reverse.IICongress enacted RFRA in direct response to the Court's decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990). There we considered a Free Exercise Clause claim brought by members of the *513 Native American Church who were denied unemployment benefits when they lost their jobs because they had used peyote. Their practice was to ingest peyote for sacramental purposes, and they challenged an Oregon statute of general applicability which made use of the drug criminal. In evaluating the claim, we declined to apply the balancing test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963), under which we would have asked whether Oregon's prohibition substantially burdened a religious practice and, if it did, whether the burden was justified by a compelling government interest. We stated:""[G]overnment's ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct . . . cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's spiritual development. To make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State's interest is `compelling'. . . contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense."" 494 U. S., at 885 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).The application of the Sherbert test, the Smith decision explained, would have produced an anomaly in the law, a constitutional right to ignore neutral laws of general applicability. The anomaly would have been accentuated, the Court reasoned, by the difficulty of determining whether a particular practice was central to an individual's religion. We explained, moreover, that it ""is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants' interpretations of those creeds."" 494 U. S., at 887 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).

The only instances where a neutral, generally applicable law had failed to pass constitutional muster, the Smith Court *514 noted, were cases in which other constitutional protections were at stake. Id. , at 881-882. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972), for example, we invalidated Wisconsin's mandatory school-attendance law as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school. That case implicated not only the right to the free exercise of religion but also the right of parents to control their children's education.

The Smith decision acknowledged the Court had employed the Sherbert test in considering free exercise challenges to state unemployment compensation rules on three occasions where the balance had tipped in favor of the individual. See Sherbert, supra; Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U. S. 707 (1981); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136 (1987). Those cases, the Court explained, stand for ""the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of religious hardship without compelling reason."" 494 U. S., at 884 (internal quotation marks omitted). By contrast, where a general prohibition, such as Oregon's, is at issue, ""the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the test inapplicable to [free exercise] challenges."" Id., at 885. Smith held that neutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest.

Four Members of the Court disagreed. They argued the law placed a substantial burden on the Native American Church members so that it could be upheld only if the law served a compelling state interest and was narrowly tailored to achieve that end. Id., at 894. Justice O'Connor concluded Oregon had satisfied the test, while Justice Blackmun, joined by Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall, could see no compelling interest justifying the law's application to the members.

*515 These points of constitutional interpretation were debated by Members of Congress in hearings and floor debates. Many criticized the Court's reasoning, and this disagreement resulted in the passage of RFRA. Congress announced:""(1) [T]he framers of the Constitution, recognizing free exercise of religion as an unalienable right, secured its protection in the First Amendment to the Constitution;""(2) laws `neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise;""(3) governments should not substantially burden religious exercise without compelling justification;""(4) in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), the Supreme Court virtually eliminated the requirement that the government justify burdens on religious exercise imposed by laws neutral toward religion; and""(5) the compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test for striking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests."" 42 U. S. C.  2000bb(a).The Act's stated purposes are:""(1) to restore the compelling interest test as set forth in Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398 (1963) and Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205 (1972) and to guarantee its application in all cases where free exercise of religion is substantially burdened; and""(2) to provide a claim or defense to persons whose religious exercise is substantially burdened by government.""  2000bb(b).RFRA prohibits ""[g]overnment"" from ""substantially burden[ing]"" a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability unless the government can demonstrate the burden ""(1) is in furtherance of *516 a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.""  2000bb1. The Act's mandate applies to any ""branch, department, agency, instrumentality, and official (or other person acting under color of law) of the United States,"" as well as to any ""State, or . . . subdivision of a State.""  2000bb2(1). The Act's universal coverage is confirmed in  2000bb3(a), under which RFRA ""applies to all Federal and State law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether adopted before or after [RFRA's enactment]."" In accordance with RFRA's usage of the term, we shall use ""state law"" to include local and municipal ordinances.IIIAUnder our Constitution, the Federal Government is one of enumerated powers. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405 (1819); see also The Federalist No. 45, p. 292 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). The judicial authority to determine the constitutionality of laws, in cases and controversies, is based on the premise that the ""powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written."" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).

Congress relied on its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power in enacting the most far-reaching and substantial of RFRA's provisions, those which impose its requirements on the States. See Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, S. Rep. No. 103-111, pp. 13-14 (1993) (Senate Report); H. R. Rep. No. 103-88, p. 9 (1993) (House Report). The Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant part:""Section 1. . . . No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process *517 of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.. . . . .""Section 5. The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.""The parties disagree over whether RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress'  5 power ""to enforce"" by ""appropriate legislation"" the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of ""life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,"" nor deny any person ""equal protection of the laws.""

In defense of the Act, respondent the Archbishop contends, with support from the United States, that RFRA is permissible enforcement legislation. Congress, it is said, is only protecting by legislation one of the liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the free exercise of religion, beyond what is necessary under Smith . It is said the congressional decision to dispense with proof of deliberate or overt discrimination and instead concentrate on a law's effects accords with the settled understanding that  5 includes the power to enact legislation designed to prevent, as well as remedy, constitutional violations. It is further contended that Congress'  5 power is not limited to remedial or preventive legislation.

All must acknowledge that  5 is ""a positive grant of legislative power"" to Congress, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651 (1966). In Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345 346 (1880), we explained the scope of Congress'  5 power in the following broad terms:""Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not *518 prohibited, is brought within the domain of congressional power.""Legislation which deters or remedies constitutional violations can fall within the sweep of Congress' enforcement power even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and intrudes into ""legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States."" Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976). For example, the Court upheld a suspension of literacy tests and similar voting requirements under Congress' parallel power to enforce the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 15,  2, as a measure to combat racial discrimination in voting, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308 (1966), despite the facial constitutionality of the tests under Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U. S. 45 (1959). We have also concluded that other measures protecting voting rights are within Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, despite the burdens those measures placed on the States. South Carolina  v. Katzenbach, supra (upholding several provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965); Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra  (upholding ban on literacy tests that prohibited certain people schooled in Puerto Rico from voting); Oregon v. Mitchell,  400 U. S. 112 (1970) (upholding 5-year nationwide ban on literacy tests and similar voting requirements for registering to vote); City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 161 (1980) (upholding 7-year extension of the Voting Rights Act's requirement that certain jurisdictions preclear any change to a ""`standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting' ""); see also James Everard's Breweries v. Day, 265 U. S. 545 (1924) (upholding ban on medical prescription of intoxicating malt liquors as appropriate to enforce Eighteenth Amendment ban on manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes).

It is also true, however, that ""[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited."" Oregon v. *519 Mitchell, supra, at 128 (opinion of Black, J.). In assessing the breadth of  5's enforcement power, we begin with its text. Congress has been given the power ""to enforce"" the ""provisions of this article."" We agree with respondent, of course, that Congress can enact legislation under  5 enforcing the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. The ""provisions of this article,"" to which  5 refers, include the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Congress' power to enforce the Free Exercise Clause follows from our holding in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 (1940), that the ""fundamental concept of liberty embodied in [the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause] embraces the liberties guaranteed by the First Amendment."" See also United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 789 (1966) (there is ""no doubt of the power of Congress to enforce by appropriate criminal sanction every right guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Congress' power under  5, however, extends only to ""enforc[ing]"" the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has described this power as ""remedial,"" South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 326. The design of the Amendment and the text of  5 are inconsistent with the suggestion that Congress has the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States. Legislation which alters the meaning of the Free Exercise Clause cannot be said to be enforcing the Clause. Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is. It has been given the power ""to enforce,"" not the power to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any meaningful sense, the ""provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].""

While the line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law is not easy to discern, and *520 Congress must have wide latitude in determining where it lies, the distinction exists and must be observed. There must be a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end. Lacking such a connection, legislation may become substantive in operation and effect. History and our case law support drawing the distinction, one apparent from the text of the Amendment.1The Fourteenth Amendment's history confirms the remedial, rather than substantive, nature of the Enforcement Clause. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction of the 39th Congress began drafting what would become the Fourteenth Amendment in January 1866. The objections to the Committee's first draft of the Amendment, and the rejection of the draft, have a direct bearing on the central issue of defining Congress' enforcement power. In February, Republican Representative John Bingham of Ohio reported the following draft Amendment to the House of Representatives on behalf of the Joint Committee:""The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper to secure to the citizens of each State all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the several States equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and property."" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1034 (1866).The proposal encountered immediate opposition, which continued through three days of debate. Members of Congress from across the political spectrum criticized the Amendment, and the criticisms had a common theme: The proposed Amendment gave Congress too much legislative power at the expense of the existing constitutional structure. E. g., id., at 1063-1065 (statement of Rep. Hale); id., at 1082 *521 (statement of Sen. Stewart); id., at 1095 (statement of Rep. Hotchkiss); id., at App. 133-135 (statement of Rep. Rogers). Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment ""an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,"" id., at 1063, and warned that under it ""all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedure . . . may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead."" Ibid. Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit ""Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,"" such that ""there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,"" and would thereby ""work an entire change in our form of government."" Id., at 1082; accord, id.,  at 1087 (statement of Rep. Davis); id., at App. 133 (statement of Rep. Rogers). Some radicals, like their brethren ""unwilling that Congress shall have any such power . . . to establish uniform laws throughout the United States upon . . . the protection of life, liberty, and property,"" id., at 1095 (statement of Rep. Hotchkiss), also objected that giving Congress primary responsibility for enforcing legal equality would place power in the hands of changing congressional majorities, ibid. See generally Bickel, The Original Understanding and the Segregation Decision, 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 57 (1955); Graham, Our ""Declaratory"" Fourteenth Amendment, 7 Stan. L. Rev. 3, 21 (1954).

As a result of these objections having been expressed from so many different quarters, the House voted to table the proposal until April. See, e. g., B. Kendrick, Journal of the Joint Committee of Fifteen on Reconstruction 215, 217 (1914); Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 115 (1871) (statement *522 of Rep. Farnsworth). The congressional action was seen as marking the defeat of the proposal. See The Nation, Mar. 8, 1866, p. 291 (""The postponement of the amendment . . . is conclusive against the passage of [it]""); New York Times, Mar. 1, 1866, p.4 (""It is doubtful if this ever comes before the House again . . .""); see also Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 115 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth) (The Amendment was ""given its quietus by a postponement for two months, where it slept the sleep that knows no waking""). The measure was defeated ""chiefly because many members of the legal profession s[aw] in [it] . . . a dangerous centralization of power,"" The Nation, supra, at 291, and ""many leading Republicans of th[e] House [of Representatives] would not consent to so radical a change in the Constitution,"" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep. Garfield). The Amendment in its early form was not again considered. Instead, the Joint Committee began drafting a new article of Amendment, which it reported to Congress on April 30, 1866.
Section 1 of the new draft Amendment imposed selfexecuting limits on the States. Section 5 prescribed that ""[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article."" See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2286. Under the revised Amendment, Congress' power was no longer plenary but remedial. Congress was granted the power to make the substantive constitutional prohibitions against the States effective. Representative Bingham said the new draft would give Congress ""the power . . . to protect by national law the privileges and immunities of all the citizens of the Republic . . . whenever the same shall be abridged or denied by the unconstitutional acts of any State."" Id., at 2542. Representative Stevens described the new draft Amendment as ""allow[ing] Congress to correct the unjust legislation of the States."" Id., at 2459. See also id., at 2768 (statement of Sen. Howard) ( 5 ""enables Congress, in case the States shall enact *523 laws in conflict with the principles of the amendment, to correct that legislation by a formal congressional enactment""). See generally H. Brannon, The Rights and Privileges Guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States 387 (1901) (Congress' ""powers are only prohibitive, corrective, vetoing, aimed only at undue process of law""); id., at 420, 452-455 (same); T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871) (""This amendment of the Constitution does not concentrate power in the general government for any purpose of police government within the States; its object is to preclude legislation by any State which shall `abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States' ""). The revised Amendment proposal did not raise the concerns expressed earlier regarding broad congressional power to prescribe uniform national laws with respect to life, liberty, and property. See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at App. 151 (statement of Rep. Garfield) (""The [Fourteenth Amendment] limited but did not oust the jurisdiction of the State[s]""). After revisions not relevant here, the new measure passed both Houses and was ratified in July 1868 as the Fourteenth Amendment.

The significance of the defeat of the Bingham proposal was apparent even then. During the debates over the Ku Klux Klan Act only a few years after the Amendment's ratification, Representative James Garfield argued there were limits on Congress' enforcement power, saying ""unless we ignore both the history and the language of these clauses we cannot, by any reasonable interpretation, give to [ 5] . . . the force and effect of the rejected [Bingham] clause."" Ibid.;  see also id., at App. 115-116 (statement of Rep. Farnsworth). Scholars of successive generations have agreed with this assessment. See H. Flack, The Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment 64 (1908); Bickel, The Voting Rights Cases, 1966 S. Ct. Rev. 79, 97.

The design of the Fourteenth Amendment has proved significant also in maintaining the traditional separation of powers *524 between Congress and the Judiciary. The first eight Amendments to the Constitution set forth self-executing prohibitions on governmental action, and this Court has had primary authority to interpret those prohibitions. The Bingham draft, some thought, departed from that tradition by vesting in Congress primary power to interpret and elaborate on the meaning of the new Amendment through legislation. Under it, ""Congress, and not the courts, was to judge whether or not any of the privileges or immunities were not secured to citizens in the several States."" Flack, supra, at 64. While this separation-of-powers aspect did not occasion the widespread resistance which was caused by the proposal's threat to the federal balance, it nonetheless attracted the attention of various Members. See Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1064 (statement of Rep. Hale) (noting that Bill of Rights, unlike the Bingham proposal, ""provide[s] safeguards to be enforced by the courts, and not to be exercised by the Legislature""); id., at App. 133 (statement of Rep. Rogers) (prior to Bingham proposal it ""was left entirely for the courts . . . to enforce the privileges and immunities of the citizens""). As enacted, the Fourteenth Amendment confers substantive rights against the States which, like the provisions of the Bill of Rights, are self-executing. Cf. South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 325 (discussing Fifteenth Amendment). The power to interpret the Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the Judiciary.2The remedial and preventive nature of Congress' enforcement power, and the limitation inherent in the power, were confirmed in our earliest cases on the Fourteenth Amendment. In the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the Court invalidated sections of the Civil Rights Act of 1875 which prescribed criminal penalties for denying to any person ""the full enjoyment of"" public accommodations and conveyances, on the grounds that it exceeded Congress' power *525 by seeking to regulate private conduct. The Enforcement Clause, the Court said, did not authorize Congress to pass ""general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective legislation, that is, such as may be necessary and proper for counteracting such laws as the States may adopt or enforce, and which, by the amendment, they are prohibited from making or enforcing . . . ."" Id., at 13-14. The power to ""legislate generally upon"" life, liberty, and property, as opposed to the ""power to provide modes of redress"" against offensive state action, was ""repugnant"" to the Constitution. Id., at 15. See also United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 218 (1876); United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 639 (1883); James v. Bowman, 190 U. S. 127, 139 (1903). Although the specific holdings of these early cases might have been superseded or modified, see, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964); United States v. Guest,  383 U. S. 745 (1966), their treatment of Congress'  5 power as corrective or preventive, not definitional, has not been questioned.

Recent cases have continued to revolve around the question whether  5 legislation can be considered remedial. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, we emphasized that ""[t]he constitutional propriety of [legislation adopted under the Enforcement Clause] must be judged with reference to the historical experience . . . it reflects."" 383 U. S., at 308. There we upheld various provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, finding them to be ""remedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has been most flagrant,"" id., at 315, and necessary to ""banish the blight of racial discrimination in voting, which has infected the electoral process in parts of our country for nearly a century,"" id., at 308. We noted evidence in the record reflecting the subsisting and pervasive discriminatoryand therefore unconstitutionaluse of literacy tests. Id., at 333-334. The Act's new remedies, which used the administrative resources of the Federal Government, included the suspension of both literacy tests and, *526 pending federal review, all new voting regulations in covered jurisdictions, as well as the assignment of federal examiners to list qualified applicants enabling those listed to vote. The new, unprecedented remedies were deemed necessary given the ineffectiveness of the existing voting rights laws, see id.,  at 313-315, and the slow, costly character of case-by-case litigation, id., at 328.

After South Carolina v. Katzenbach , the Court continued to acknowledge the necessity of using strong remedial and preventive measures to respond to the widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights resulting from this country's history of racial discrimination. See Oregon  v. Mitchell, 400 U. S., at 132 (""In enacting the literacy test ban . . . Congress had before it a long history of the discriminatory use of literacy tests to disfranchise voters on account of their race"") (opinion of Black, J.); id., at 147 (Literacy tests ""have been used at times as a discriminatory weapon against some minorities, not only Negroes but Americans of Mexican ancestry, and American Indians"") (opinion of Douglas, J.); id.,  at 216 (""Congress could have determined that racial prejudice is prevalent throughout the Nation, and that literacy tests unduly lend themselves to discriminatory application, either conscious or unconscious"") (opinion of Harlan, J.); id.,  at 235 (""[T]here is no question but that Congress could legitimately have concluded that the use of literacy tests anywhere within the United States has the inevitable effect of denying the vote to members of racial minorities whose inability to pass such tests is the direct consequence of previous governmental discrimination in education"") (opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 284 (""[N]ationwide [suspension of literacy tests] may be reasonably thought appropriate when Congress acts against an evil such as racial discrimination which in varying degrees manifests itself in every part of the country"") (opinion of Stewart, J.); City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 182 (""Congress' considered determination that at least another 7 years of statutory remedies were necessary to counter the *527 perpetuation of 95 years of pervasive voting discrimination is both unsurprising and unassailable""); Morgan, 384 U. S., at 656 (Congress had a factual basis to conclude that New York's literacy requirement ""constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause"").3Any suggestion that Congress has a substantive, nonremedial power under the Fourteenth Amendment is not supported by our case law. In Oregon v. Mitchell, supra, at 112, a majority of the Court concluded Congress had exceeded its enforcement powers by enacting legislation lowering the minimum age of voters from 21 to 18 in state and local elections. The five Members of the Court who reached this conclusion explained that the legislation intruded into an area reserved by the Constitution to the States. See 400 U. S., at 125 (concluding that the legislation was unconstitutional because the Constitution ""reserves to the States the power to set voter qualifications in state and local elections"") (opinion of Black, J.); id., at 154 (explaining that the ""Fourteenth Amendment was never intended to restrict the authority of the States to allocate their political power as they see fit"") (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 294 (concluding that States, not Congress, have the power ""to establish a qualification for voting based on age"") (opinion of Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Blackmun, J.). Four of these five were explicit in rejecting the position that  5 endowed Congress with the power to establish the meaning of constitutional provisions. See id., at 209 (opinion of Harlan, J.); id., at 296 (opinion of Stewart, J.). Justice Black's rejection of this position might be inferred from his disagreement with Congress' interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause. See id., at 125.

There is language in our opinion in Katzenbach v. Morgan,  384 U. S. 641 (1966), which could be interpreted as acknowledging a power in Congress to enact legislation that expands *528 the rights contained in  1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is not a necessary interpretation, however, or even the best one. In Morgan, the Court considered the constitutionality of  4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided that no person who had successfully completed the sixth primary grade in a public school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in which the language of instruction was other than English could be denied the right to vote because of an inability to read or write English. New York's Constitution, on the other hand, required voters to be able to read and write English. The Court provided two related rationales for its conclusion that  4(e) could ""be viewed as a measure to secure for the Puerto Rican community residing in New York nondiscriminatory treatment by government."" Id., at 652. Under the first rationale, Congress could prohibit New York from denying the right to vote to large segments of its Puerto Rican community, in order to give Puerto Ricans ""enhanced political power"" that would be ""helpful in gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public services for the entire Puerto Rican community."" Ibid. Section 4(e) thus could be justified as a remedial measure to deal with ""discrimination in governmental services."" Id., at 653. The second rationale, an alternative holding, did not address discrimination in the provision of public services but ""discrimination in establishing voter qualifications."" Id., at 654. The Court perceived a factual basis on which Congress could have concluded that New York's literacy requirement ""constituted an invidious discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause."" Id., at 656. Both rationales for upholding  4(e) rested on unconstitutional discrimination by New York and Congress' reasonable attempt to combat it. As Justice Stewart explained in Oregon v. Mitchell, supra, at 296, interpreting Morgan to give Congress the power to interpret the Constitution ""would require an enormous extension of that decision's rationale.""

*529 If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth Amendment's meaning, no longer would the Constitution be ""superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means."" It would be ""on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other acts, . . .alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it."" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 177. Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power. See Van Alstyne, The Failure of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, 46 Duke L. J. 291, 292-303 (1996). Shifting legislative majorities could change the Constitution and effectively circumvent the difficult and detailed amendment process contained in Article V.

We now turn to consider whether RFRA can be considered enforcement legislation under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.BRespondent contends that RFRA is a proper exercise of Congress' remedial or preventive power. The Act, it is said, is a reasonable means of protecting the free exercise of religion as defined by Smith. It prevents and remedies laws which are enacted with the unconstitutional object of targeting religious beliefs and practices. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 533 (1993) (""[A] law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible""). To avoid the difficulty of proving such violations, it is said, Congress can simply invalidate any law which imposes a substantial burden on a religious practice unless it is justified by a compelling interest and is the least restrictive means of accomplishing that interest. If Congress can prohibit laws with discriminatory effects in order to prevent racial discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause, see Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 477 (1980) (plurality opinion); City of Rome , 446 U. S., at 177, then it can do the same, respondent argues, to promote religious liberty.

*530 While preventive rules are sometimes appropriate remedial measures, there must be a congruence between the means used and the ends to be achieved. The appropriateness of remedial measures must be considered in light of the evil presented. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 308. Strong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one. Id., at 334.

A comparison between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act is instructive. In contrast to the record which confronted Congress and the Judiciary in the voting rights cases, RFRA's legislative record lacks examples of modern instances of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry. The history of persecution in this country detailed in the hearings mentions no episodes occurring in the past 40 years. See, e. g., Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1991, Hearings on H. R. 2797 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 331-334 (1993) (statement of Douglas Laycock) (House Hearings); The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 30-31 (1993) (statement of Dallin H. Oaks) (Senate Hearing); id., at 68-76 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1990, Hearing on H. R. 5377 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 49 (1991) (statement of John H. Buchanan, Jr.) (1990 House Hearing). The absence of more recent episodes stems from the fact that, as one witness testified, ""deliberate persecution is not the usual problem in this country."" House Hearings 334 (statement of Douglas Laycock). See also House Report 2 (""[L]aws directly targeting religious practices have become increasingly rare""). Rather, the emphasis of the hearings was on laws of general applicability which place incidental burdens on religion. Much of the discussion centered *531 upon anecdotal evidence of autopsies performed on Jewish individuals and Hmong immigrants in violation of their religious beliefs, see, e. g., House Hearings 81 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 107-110 (statement of William Yang); id., at 118 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); id., at 336 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Senate Hearing 5-6, 14-26 (statement of William Yang); id., at 27-28 (statement of Hmong-Lao Unity Assn., Inc.); id., at 50 (statement of Baptist Joint Committee); see also Senate Report 8; House Report 5-6, and n. 14, and on zoning regulations and historic preservation laws (like the one at issue here), which, as an incident of their normal operation, have adverse effects on churches and synagogues. See, e. g., House Hearings 17, 57 (statement of Robert P. Dugan, Jr.); id., at 81 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 122-123 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); id., at 157 (statement of Edward M. Gaffney, Jr.); id., at 327 (statement of Douglas Laycock); Senate Hearing 143-144 (statement of Forest D. Montgomery); 1990 House Hearing 39 (statement of Robert P. Dugan, Jr.); see also Senate Report 8; House Report 5-6, and n. 14. It is difficult to maintain that they are examples of legislation enacted or enforced due to animus or hostility to the burdened religious practices or that they indicate some widespread pattern of religious discrimination in this country. Congress' concern was with the incidental burdens imposed, not the object or purpose of the legislation. See House Report 2; Senate Report 4-5; House Hearings 64 (statement of Nadine Strossen); id., at 117-118 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz); 1990 House Hearing 14 (statement of Rep. Stephen J. Solarz). This lack of support in the legislative record, however, is not RFRA's most serious shortcoming. Judicial deference, in most cases, is based not on the state of the legislative record Congress compiles but ""on due regard for the decision of the body constitutionally appointed to decide."" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S., at 207 (opinion of Harlan, J.). As a general *532 matter, it is for Congress to determine the method by which it will reach a decision.

Regardless of the state of the legislative record, RFRA cannot be considered remedial, preventive legislation, if those terms are to have any meaning. RFRA is so out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior. It appears, instead, to attempt a substantive change in constitutional protections. Preventive measures prohibiting certain types of laws may be appropriate when there is reason to believe that many of the laws affected by the congressional enactment have a significant likelihood of being unconstitutional. See City of Rome, 446 U. S., at 177 (since ""jurisdictions with a demonstrable history of intentional racial discrimination . . . create the risk of purposeful discrimination,"" Congress could ""prohibit changes that have a discriminatory impact"" in those jurisdictions). Remedial legislation under  5 ""should be adapted to the mischief and wrong which the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment was intended to provide against."" Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S., at 13.

RFRA is not so confined. Sweeping coverage ensures its intrusion at every level of government, displacing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and regardless of subject matter. RFRA's restrictions apply to every agency and official of the Federal, State, and local Governments. 42 U. S. C.  2000bb2(1). RFRA applies to all federal and state law, statutory or otherwise, whether adopted before or after its enactment.  2000bb3(a). RFRA has no termination date or termination mechanism. Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion.

The reach and scope of RFRA distinguish it from other measures passed under Congress' enforcement power, even in the area of voting rights. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach, the challenged provisions were confined to those regions *533 of the country where voting discrimination had been most flagrant, see 383 U. S., at 315, and affected a discrete class of state laws, i. e., state voting laws. Furthermore, to ensure that the reach of the Voting Rights Act was limited to those cases in which constitutional violations were most likely (in order to reduce the possibility of overbreadth), the coverage under the Act would terminate ""at the behest of States and political subdivisions in which the danger of substantial voting discrimination has not materialized during the preceding five years."" Id., at 331. The provisions restricting and banning literacy tests, upheld in Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966), and Oregon v. Mitchell, supra,  attacked a particular type of voting qualification, one with a long history as a ""notorious means to deny and abridge voting rights on racial grounds."" South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 355 (Black, J., concurring and dissenting). In City of Rome, supra, the Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of a Voting Rights Act provision which required certain jurisdictions to submit changes in electoral practices to the Department of Justice for preimplementation review. The requirement was placed only on jurisdictions with a history of intentional racial discrimination in voting. Id., at 177. Like the provisions at issue in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, this provision permitted a covered jurisdiction to avoid preclearance requirements under certain conditions and, moreover, lapsed in seven years. This is not to say, of course, that  5 legislation requires termination dates, geographic restrictions, or egregious predicates. Where, however, a congressional enactment pervasively prohibits constitutional state action in an effort to remedy or to prevent unconstitutional state action, limitations of this kind tend to ensure Congress' means are proportionate to ends legitimate under  5.
The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the *534 State must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. Claims that a law substantially burdens someone's exercise of religion will often be difficult to contest. See Smith , 494 U. S., at 887 (""What principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to contradict a believer's assertion that a particular act is `central' to his personal faith?""); id., at 907 (""The distinction between questions of centrality and questions of sincerity and burden is admittedly fine . . ."") (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Requiring a State to demonstrate a compelling interest and show that it has adopted the least restrictive means of achieving that interest is the most demanding test known to constitutional law. If ""`compelling interest' really means what it says . . . , many laws will not meet the test. . . . [The test] would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind."" Id., at 888. Laws valid under Smith  would fall under RFRA without regard to whether they had the object of stifling or punishing free exercise. We make these observations not to reargue the position of the majority in Smith but to illustrate the substantive alteration of its holding attempted by RFRA. Even assuming RFRA would be interpreted in effect to mandate some lesser test, say, one equivalent to intermediate scrutiny, the statute nevertheless would require searching judicial scrutiny of state law with the attendant likelihood of invalidation. This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.

The substantial costs RFRA exacts, both in practical terms of imposing a heavy litigation burden on the States and in terms of curtailing their traditional general regulatory power, far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith. Simply put, RFRA is not designed to identify and counteract state laws likely to be unconstitutional because of *535 their treatment of religion. In most cases, the state laws to which RFRA applies are not ones which will have been motivated by religious bigotry. If a state law disproportionately burdened a particular class of religious observers, this circumstance might be evidence of an impermissible legislative motive. Cf. Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 241 (1976). RFRA's substantial-burden test, however, is not even a discriminatory-effects or disparate-impact test. It is a reality of the modern regulatory state that numerous state laws, such as the zoning regulations at issue here, impose a substantial burden on a large class of individuals. When the exercise of religion has been burdened in an incidental way by a law of general application, it does not follow that the persons affected have been burdened any more than other citizens, let alone burdened because of their religious beliefs. In addition, the Act imposes in every case a least restrictive means requirementa requirement that was not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codifywhich also indicates that the legislation is broader than is appropriate if the goal is to prevent and remedy constitutional violations.

When Congress acts within its sphere of power and responsibilities, it has not just the right but the duty to make its own informed judgment on the meaning and force of the Constitution. This has been clear from the early days of the Republic. In 1789, when a Member of the House of Representatives objected to a debate on the constitutionality of legislation based on the theory that ""it would be officious"" to consider the constitutionality of a measure that did not affect the House, James Madison explained that ""it is incontrovertibly of as much importance to this branch of the Government as to any other, that the constitution should be preserved entire. It is our duty."" 1 Annals of Congress 500 (1789). Were it otherwise, we would not afford Congress the presumption of validity its enactments now enjoy.

Our national experience teaches that the Constitution is preserved best when each part of the Government respects *536 both the Constitution and the proper actions and determinations of the other branches. When the Court has interpreted the Constitution, it has acted within the province of the Judicial Branch, which embraces the duty to say what the law is. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, at 177. When the political branches of the Government act against the background of a judicial interpretation of the Constitution already issued, it must be understood that in later cases and controversies the Court will treat its precedents with the respect due them under settled principles, including stare decisis, and contrary expectations must be disappointed. RFRA was designed to control cases and controversies, such as the one before us; but as the provisions of the federal statute here invoked are beyond congressional authority, it is this Court's precedent, not RFRA, which must control.* * *It is for Congress in the first instance to ""determin[e] whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,"" and its conclusions are entitled to much deference. Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S., at 651. Congress' discretion is not unlimited, however, and the courts retain the power, as they have since Marbury v. Madison, to determine if Congress has exceeded its authority under the Constitution. Broad as the power of Congress is under the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, RFRA contradicts vital principles necessary to maintain separation of powers and the federal balance. The judgment of the Court of Appeals sustaining the Act's constitutionality is reversed.

It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, concurring.In my opinion, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) is a ""law respecting an establishment of religion"" that violates the First Amendment to the Constitution.

*537 If the historic landmark on the hill in Boerne happened to be a museum or an art gallery owned by an atheist, it would not be eligible for an exemption from the city ordinances that forbid an enlargement of the structure. Because the landmark is owned by the Catholic Church, it is claimed that RFRA gives its owner a federal statutory entitlement to an exemption from a generally applicable, neutral civil law. Whether the Church would actually prevail under the statute or not, the statute has provided the Church with a legal weapon that no atheist or agnostic can obtain. This governmental preference for religion, as opposed to irreligion, is forbidden by the First Amendment. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 52-55 (1985).Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Stevens joins, concurring in part.I write to respond briefly to the claim of Justice O'Connor's dissent (hereinafter the dissent) that historical materials support a result contrary to the one reached in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990). See post, p. 544 (dissenting opinion). We held in Smith that the Constitution's Free Exercise Clause ""does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a `valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).' "" 494 U. S., at 879 (quoting United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 263, n. 3 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)). The material that the dissent claims is at odds with Smith either has little to say about the issue or is in fact more consistent with Smith  than with the dissent's interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. The dissent's extravagant claim that the historical record shows Smith to have been wrong should be compared with the assessment of the most prominent scholarly critic of Smith, who, after an extensive review of the historical record, was willing to venture no more than that ""constitutionally *538 compelled exemptions [from generally applicable laws regulating conduct] were within the contemplation of the framers and ratifiers as a possible interpretation of the free exercise clause."" McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1415 (1990) (emphasis added); see also Hamburger, A Constitutional Right of Religious Exemption: An Historical Perspective, 60 Geo. Wash. Law Rev. 915 (1992) (arguing that historical evidence supports Smith `s interpretation of free exercise).

The dissent first claims that Smith `s interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause departs from the understanding reflected in various statutory and constitutional protections of religion enacted by Colonies, States, and Territories in the period leading up to the ratification of the Bill of Rights. Post, at 550-557. But the protections afforded by those enactments are in fact more consistent with Smith `s interpretation of free exercise than with the dissent's understanding of it. The Free Exercise Clause, the dissent claims, ""is best understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and conduct without impermissible governmental interference, even when such conduct conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law""; thus, even neutral laws of general application may be invalid if they burden religiously motivated conduct. Post, at 546. However, the early ""free exercise"" enactments cited by the dissent protect only against action that is taken ""for"" or ""in respect of"" religion, post, at 551-553 (Maryland Act Concerning Religion of 1649, Rhode Island Charter of 1663, and New Hampshire Constitution); or action taken ""on account of"" religion, post, at 553-554 (Maryland Declaration of Rights of 1776 and Northwest Ordinance of 1787); or ""discriminat[ory]"" action, post, at 553 (New York Constitution); or, finally (and unhelpfully for purposes of interpreting ""free exercise"" in the Federal Constitution), action that interferes with the ""free exercise"" of religion, post, at 551, 554 (Maryland Act *539 Concerning Religion of 1649 and Georgia Constitution). It is eminently arguable that application of neutral, generally applicable laws of the sort the dissent refers tosuch as zoning laws, post, at 547would not constitute action taken ""for,"" ""in respect of,"" or ""on account of"" one's religion, or ""discriminatory"" action.

Assuming, however, that the affirmative protection of religion accorded by the early ""free exercise"" enactments sweeps as broadly as the dissent's theory would require, those enactments do not support the dissent's view, since they contain ""provisos"" that significantly qualify the affirmative protection they grant. According to the dissent, the ""provisos"" support its view because they would have been ""superfluous"" if ""the Court was correct in Smith that generally applicable laws are enforceable regardless of religious conscience."" Post, at 554-555. I disagree. In fact, the most plausible reading of the ""free exercise"" enactments (if their affirmative provisions are read broadly, as the dissent's view requires) is a virtual restatement of Smith: Religious exercise shall be permitted so long as it does not violate general laws governing conduct. The ""provisos"" in the enactments negate a license to act in a manner ""unfaithfull to the Lord Proprietary"" (Maryland Act Concerning Religion of 1649), or ""behav[e]"" in other than a ""peaceabl[e] and quie[t]"" manner (Rhode Island Charter of 1663), or ""disturb the public peace"" (New Hampshire Constitution), or interfere with the ""peace [and] safety of th[e] State"" (New York, Maryland, and Georgia Constitutions), or ""demea[n]"" oneself in other than a ""peaceable and orderly manner"" (Northwest Ordinance of 1787). See post, at 551-554. At the time these provisos were enacted, keeping ""peace"" and ""order"" seems to have meant, precisely, obeying the laws. ""[E]very breach of a law is against the peace."" Queen v. Lane, 6 Mod. 128, 87 Eng. Rep. 884, 885 (Q. B. 1704). Even as late as 1828, when Noah Webster published his American Dictionary of the English Language, he gave as one of the meanings of ""peace"": ""8. Public *540 tranquility; that quiet, order and security which is guaranteed by the laws; as, to keep the peace; to break the peace. "" 2 An American Dictionary of the English Language 31 (1828).[1] This limitation upon the scope of religious exercise would have been in accord with the background political philosophy of the age (associated most prominently with John Locke), which regarded freedom as the right ""to do only what was not lawfully prohibited,"" West, The Case Against a Right to Religion-Based Exemptions, 4 Notre Dame J. L., Ethics & Pub. Pol'y 591, 624 (1990). ""Thus, the disturb-thepeace caveats apparently permitted government to deny religious freedom, not merely in the event of violence or force, but, more generally, upon the occurrence of illegal actions."" Hamburger, supra, at 918-919.[2] And while, under this interpretation, these early ""free exercise"" enactments support the Court's judgment in Smith, I see no sensible interpretation that could cause them to support what I understand to be the position of Justice O'Connor, or any of Smith `s other critics. No one in that camp, to my knowledge, contends that their favored ""compelling state interest"" test conforms to any possible interpretation of ""breach of peace and order""i. e., that only violence or force, or any other category of action (more limited than ""violation of law"") which can possibly be conveyed by the phrase ""peace and order,"" justifies state prohibition of religiously motivated conduct.

*541 Apart from the early ""free exercise"" enactments of Colonies, States, and Territories, the dissent calls attention to those bodies', and the Continental Congress's, legislative accommodation of religious practices prior to ratification of the Bill of Rights. Post, at 557-560. This accommodationwhich took place both before and after enactment of the state constitutional protections of religious libertysuggests (according to the dissent) that ""the drafters and ratifiers of the First Amendment . . . assumed courts would apply the Free Exercise Clause similarly."" Post, at 560. But that legislatures sometimes (though not always)[3] found it ""appropriate,"" post, at 559, to accommodate religious practices does not establish that accommodation was understood to be constitutionally mandated by the Free Exercise Clause. As we explained in Smith, ""to say that a nondiscriminatory religious-practice exemption is permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say that it is constitutionally required."" 494 U. S., at 890. ""Values that are protected against government interference through enshrinement in the Bill of Rights are not thereby banished from the political process."" Ibid.

The dissent's final source of claimed historical support consists of statements of certain of the Framers in the context of debates about proposed legislative enactments or debates over general principles (not in connection with the drafting of State or Federal Constitutions). Those statements are subject to the same objection as was the evidence about legislative accommodation: There is no reason to think they were meant to describe what was constitutionally required (and judicially enforceable), as opposed to what was thought to be legislatively or even morally desirable. Thus, for example, the pamphlet written by James Madison opposing Virginia's proposed general assessment for support of religion, *542 post, at 560-561, does not argue that the assessment would violate the ""free exercise"" provision in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, although that provision had been enacted into law only eight years earlier, post, at 556; rather the pamphlet argues that the assessment wrongly placed civil society ahead of personal religious belief and, thus, should not be approved by the legislators, post, at 560-561. Likewise, the letter from George Washington to the Quakers, post, at 562, by its own terms refers to Washington's ""wish and desire"" that religion be accommodated, not his belief that existing constitutional provisions required accommodation. These and other examples offered by the dissent reflect the speakers' views of the ""proper"" relationship between government and religion, post, at 563, but not their views (at least insofar as the content or context of the material suggests) of the constitutionally required relationship. The one exception is the statement by Thomas Jefferson that he considered ""the government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises,"" post, at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted); but it is quite clear that Jefferson did not in fact espouse the broad principle of affirmative accommodation advocated by the dissent, see McConnell, 103 Harv. L. Rev., at 1449-1452.

It seems to me that the most telling point made by the dissent is to be found, not in what it says, but in what it fails to say. Had the understanding in the period surrounding the ratification of the Bill of Rights been that the various forms of accommodation discussed by the dissent were constitutionally required (either by State Constitutions or by the Federal Constitution), it would be surprising not to find a single state or federal case refusing to enforce a generally applicable statute because of its failure to make accommodation. Yet the dissent cites noneand to my knowledge, and to the knowledge of the academic defenders of the dissent's position, see, e. g., id., at 1504, 1506-1511 (discussing early *543 cases), none exists. The closest one can come in the period prior to 1850 is the decision of a New York City municipal court in 1813, holding that the New York Constitution of 1777, quoted post, at 553, required acknowledgment of a priest-penitent privilege, to protect a Catholic priest from being compelled to testify as to the contents of a confession. People v. Phillips, Court of General Sessions, City of New York (June 14, 1813), excerpted in Privileged Communications to Clergymen, 1 Cath. Law. 199 (1955). Even this lone case is weak authority, not only because it comes from a minor court,[4] but also because it did not involve a statute, and the same result might possibly have been achieved (without invoking constitutional entitlement) by the court's simply modifying the common-law rules of evidence to recognize such a privilege. On the other side of the ledger, moreover, there are two cases, from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, flatly rejecting the dissent's view. In Simon's Executors v. Gratz, 2 Pen. & W. 412 (Pa. 1831), the court held that a litigant was not entitled to a continuance of trial on the ground that appearing on his Sabbath would violate his religious principles. And in Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213 (Pa. 1793), decided just two years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the court imposed a fine on a witness who ""refused to be sworn, because it was his Sabbath.""[5]

I have limited this response to the new items of ""historical evidence"" brought forward by today's dissent. (The dissent's *544 claim that ""[b]efore Smith, our free exercise cases were generally in keeping"" with the dissent's view, post, at 546, is adequately answered in Smith itself.) The historical evidence marshalled by the dissent cannot fairly be said to demonstrate the correctness of Smith; but it is more supportive of that conclusion than destructive of it. And, to return to a point I made earlier, that evidence is not compatible with any theory I am familiar with that has been proposed as an alternative to Smith. The dissent's approach has, of course, great popular attraction. Who can possibly be against the abstract proposition that government should not, even in its general, nondiscriminatory laws, place unreasonable burdens upon religious practice? Unfortunately, however, that abstract proposition must ultimately be reduced to concrete cases. The issue presented by Smith is, quite simply, whether the people, through their elected representatives, or rather this Court, shall control the outcome of those concrete cases. For example, shall it be the determination of this Court, or rather of the people, whether (as the dissent apparently believes, post , at 547) church construction will be exempt from zoning laws? The historical evidence put forward by the dissent does nothing to undermine the conclusion we reached in Smith: It shall be the people.Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins except as to the first paragraph of Part I, dissenting.I dissent from the Court's disposition of this case. I agree with the Court that the issue before us is whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) is a proper exercise of Congress' power to enforce  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. But as a yardstick for measuring the constitutionality of RFRA, the Court uses its holding in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), the decision that prompted Congress to enact RFRA as a means of more rigorously enforcing the Free Exercise Clause. I remain of the view that Smith was *545 wrongly decided, and I would use this case to reexamine the Court's holding there. Therefore, I would direct the parties to brief the question whether Smith represents the correct understanding of the Free Exercise Clause and set the case for reargument. If the Court were to correct the misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in Smith, it would simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and allay the legitimate concerns of a majority in Congress who believed that Smith improperly restricted religious liberty. We would then be in a position to review RFRA in light of a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.II agree with much of the reasoning set forth in Part IIIA of the Court's opinion. Indeed, if I agreed with the Court's standard in Smith, I would join the opinion. As the Court's careful and thorough historical analysis shows, Congress lacks the ""power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment's restrictions on the States."" Ante, at 519 (emphasis added). Rather, its power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment extends only to enforcing the Amendment's provisions. In short, Congress lacks the ability independently to define or expand the scope of constitutional rights by statute. Accordingly, whether Congress has exceeded its  5 powers turns on whether there is a ""congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end."" Ante, at 520. This recognition does not, of course, in any way diminish Congress' obligation to draw its own conclusions regarding the Constitution's meaning. Congress, no less than this Court, is called upon to consider the requirements of the Constitution and to act in accordance with its dictates. But when it enacts legislation in furtherance of its delegated powers, Congress must make its judgments consistent with this Court's exposition of the Constitution and with the limits *546 placed on its legislative authority by provisions such as the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Court's analysis of whether RFRA is a constitutional exercise of Congress'  5 power, set forth in Part IIIB of its opinion, is premised on the assumption that Smith correctly interprets the Free Exercise Clause. This is an assumption that I do not accept. I continue to believe that Smith  adopted an improper standard for deciding free exercise claims. In Smith, five Members of this Courtwithout briefing or argument on the issueinterpreted the Free Exercise Clause to permit the government to prohibit, without justification, conduct mandated by an individual's religious beliefs, so long as the prohibition is generally applicable. Contrary to the Court's holding in that case, however, the Free Exercise Clause is not simply an antidiscrimination principle that protects only against those laws that single out religious practice for unfavorable treatment. See Smith, supra, at 892-903 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Rather, the Clause is best understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious practices and conduct without impermissible governmental interference, even when such conduct conflicts with a neutral, generally applicable law. Before Smith, our free exercise cases were generally in keeping with this idea: where a law substantially burdened religiously motivated conduct regardless whether it was specifically targeted at religion or applied generallywe required government to justify that law with a compelling state interest and to use means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. See 494 U. S., at 894 (citing Hernandez v. Commissioner, 490 U. S. 680, 699 (1989); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Fla., 480 U. S. 136, 141 (1987); United States v. Lee, 455 U. S. 252, 257-258 (1982); McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618, 626-629 (1978); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U. S. 205, 215 (1972); Gillette v. United States, 401 U. S. 437, 462 (1971); Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963)).

*547 The Court's rejection of this principle in Smith is supported neither by precedent nor, as discussed below, by history. The decision has harmed religious liberty. For example, a Federal District Court, in reliance on Smith, ruled that the Free Exercise Clause was not implicated where Hmong natives objected on religious grounds to their son's autopsy, conducted pursuant to a generally applicable state law. Yang v. Sturner, 750 F. Supp. 558, 559 (RI 1990). The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that application of a city's zoning laws to prevent a church from conducting services in an area zoned for commercial uses raised no free exercise concerns, even though the city permitted secular notfor-profit organizations in that area. Cornerstone Bible Church v. Hastings, 948 F. 2d 464 (1991); see also Rector of St. Bartholomew's Church v. New York, 914 F. 2d 348, 355 (CA2 1990) (no free exercise claim where city's application of facially neutral landmark designation law ""drastically restricted the Church's ability to raise revenue to carry out its various charitable and ministerial programs""), cert. denied, 499 U. S. 905 (1991); State v. Hershberger, 462 N. W. 2d 393 (Minn. 1990) (Free Exercise Clause provided no basis for exempting an Amish farmer from displaying a bright orange triangle on his buggy, to which the farmer objected on religious grounds, even though the evidence showed that some other material would have served the State's purpose equally well). These cases demonstrate that lower courts applying Smith no longer find necessary a searching judicial inquiry into the possibility of reasonably accommodating religious practice.

Stare decisis concerns should not prevent us from revisiting our holding in Smith. ""`[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.' "" Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515 U. S. *548 200, 231 (1995) (quoting Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940)). This principle is particularly true in constitutional cases, whereas this case so plainly illustrates""correction through legislative action is practically impossible."" Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 63 (1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). I believe that, in light of both our precedent and our Nation's tradition of religious liberty, Smith is demonstrably wrong. Moreover, it is a recent decision. As such, it has not engendered the kind of reliance on its continued application that would militate against overruling it. Cf. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 855-856 (1992).

Accordingly, I believe that we should reexamine our holding in Smith, and do so in this very case. In its place, I would return to a rule that requires government to justify any substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state interest and to impose that burden only by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.III shall not restate what has been said in other opinions, which have demonstrated that Smith is gravely at odds with our earlier free exercise precedents. See Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 570-571 (1993) (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (stating that it is ""difficult to escape the conclusion that, whatever Smith `s virtues, they do not include a comfortable fit with settled law""); Smith , 494 U. S., at 894-901 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also McConnell, Free Exercise Revisionism and the Smith Decision, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1109, 1120-1127 (1990). Rather, I examine here the early American tradition of religious free exercise to gain insight into the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clausean inquiry the Court in Smith did not undertake. We have previously recognized the importance of interpreting the Religion Clauses in light of their history. Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 673 (1984) (""The Court's *549 interpretation of the Establishment Clause has comported with what history reveals was the contemporaneous understanding of its guarantees""); School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 212-214 (1963).

The historical evidence casts doubt on the Court's current interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. The record instead reveals that its drafters and ratifiers more likely viewed the Free Exercise Clause as a guarantee that government may not unnecessarily hinder believers from freely practicing their religion, a position consistent with our preSmith jurisprudence.AThe original Constitution, drafted in 1787 and ratified by the States in 1788, had no provisions safeguarding individual liberties, such as freedom of speech or religion. Federalists, the chief supporters of the new Constitution, took the view that amending the Constitution to explicitly protect individual freedoms was superfluous, since the rights that the amendments would protect were already completely secure. See, e. g., 1 Annals of Congress 440, 443-444, 448-459 (Gales and Seaton ed. 1834) (remarks of James Madison, June 8, 1789). Moreover, they feared that guaranteeing certain civil liberties might backfire, since the express mention of some freedoms might imply that others were not protected. According to Alexander Hamilton, a Bill of Rights would even be dangerous, in that by specifying ""various exceptions to powers"" not granted, it ""would afford a colorable pretext to claim more than were granted."" The Federalist No. 84, p. 513 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Anti-Federalists, however, insisted on more definite guarantees. Apprehensive that the newly established Federal Government would overwhelm the rights of States and individuals, they wanted explicit assurances that the Federal Government had no power in matters of personal liberty. T. Curry, The First Freedoms: Church and State in America to the Passage of the First Amendment 194 (1986). Additionally, Baptists and other Protestant dissenters feared for their religious liberty under *550 the new Federal Government and called for an amendment guaranteeing religious freedom. Id., at 198.

In the end, legislators acceded to these demands. By December 1791, the Bill of Rights had been added to the Constitution. With respect to religious liberty, the First Amendment provided: ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" U. S. Const., Amdt. 1. Neither the First Congress nor the ratifying state legislatures debated the question of religious freedom in much detail, nor did they directly consider the scope of the First Amendment's free exercise protection. It would be disingenuous to say that the Framers neglected to define precisely the scope of the Free Exercise Clause because the words ""free exercise"" had a precise meaning. L. Levy, Essays on American Constitutional History 173 (1972). As is the case for a number of the terms used in the Bill of Rights, it is not exactly clear what the Framers thought the phrase signified. Ibid. (""[I]t is astonishing to discover that the debate on a Bill of Rights was conducted on a level of abstraction so vague as to convey the impression that Americans of 1787-1788 had only the most nebulous conception of the meanings of the particular rights they sought to insure""). But a variety of sources supplement the legislative history and shed light on the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clause. These materials suggest thatcontrary to Smith the Framers did not intend simply to prevent the government from adopting laws that discriminated against religion. Although the Framers may not have asked precisely the questions about religious liberty that we do today, the historical record indicates that they believed that the Constitution affirmatively protects religious free exercise and that it limits the government's ability to intrude on religious practice.BThe principle of religious ""free exercise"" and the notion that religious liberty deserved legal protection were by no *551 means new concepts in 1791, when the Bill of Rights was ratified. To the contrary, these principles were first articulated in this country in the Colonies of Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Carolina, in the mid1600's. These Colonies, though established as sanctuaries for particular groups of religious dissenters, extended freedom of religion to groupsalthough often limited to Christian groupsbeyond their own. Thus, they encountered early on the conflicts that may arise in a society made up of a plurality of faiths.

The term ""free exercise"" appeared in an American legal document as early as 1648, when Lord Baltimore extracted from the new Protestant Governor of Maryland and his councilors a promise not to disturb Christians, particularly Roman Catholics, in the ""free exercise"" of their religion. McConnell, The Origins and Historical Understanding of Free Exercise of Religion, 103 Harv. L. Rev. 1409, 1425 (1990) (hereinafter Origins of Free Exercise). Soon after, in 1649, the Maryland Assembly enacted the first free exercise clause by passing the Act Concerning Religion: ""[N]oe person . . . professing to beleive in Jesus Christ, shall from henceforth bee any waies troubled, Molested or discountenanced for or in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise thereof . . . nor any way [be] compelled to the beleife or exercise of any other Religion against his or her consent, soe as they be not unfaithfull to the Lord Proprietary, or molest or conspire against the civill Government."" Act Concerning Religion of 1649, reprinted in 5 The Founders' Constitution 49, 50 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987) (hereinafter Founders' Constitution). Rhode Island's Charter of 1663 used the analogous term ""liberty of conscience."" It protected residents from being in any ways ""molested, punished, disquieted, or called in question, for any differences in opinione, in matters of religion, and doe not actually disturb the civil peace of our sayd colony."" The Charter further provided that residents may ""freely, and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments, and conscience in matters of religious *552 concernments . . . ; they behaving themselves peaceably and quietly and not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness; nor to the civil injury, or outward disturbance of others."" Charter of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, 1663, in 8 W. Swindler, Sources and Documents of United States Constitutions 363 (1979) (hereinafter Swindler). Various agreements between prospective settlers and the proprietors of Carolina, New York, and New Jersey similarly guaranteed religious freedom, using language that paralleled that of the Rhode Island Charter of 1663. See New York Act Declaring Rights & Priviledges (1691); Concession and Agreement of the Lords Proprietors of the Province of New Caesarea, or New-Jersey (1664); Laws of West NewJersey, Art. X (1681); Fundamental Constitutions for East New-Jersey, Art. XVI (1683); First Charter of Carolina, Art. XVIII (1663). N. Cogan, The Complete Bill of Rights 23-27 (Galley 1997).

These documents suggest that, early in our country's history, several Colonies acknowledged that freedom to pursue one's chosen religious beliefs was an essential liberty. Moreover, these Colonies appeared to recognize that government should interfere in religious matters only when necessary to protect the civil peace or to prevent ""licentiousness."" In other words, when religious beliefs conflicted with civil law, religion prevailed unless important state interests militated otherwise. Such notions parallel the ideas expressed in our pre-Smith casesthat government may not hinder believers from freely exercising their religion, unless necessary to further a significant state interest.CThe principles expounded in these early charters reemerged over a century later in state constitutions that were adopted in the flurry of constitution drafting that followed the American Revolution. By 1789, every State but Connecticut had incorporated some version of a free exercise *553 clause into its constitution. Origins of Free Exercise 1455. These state provisions, which were typically longer and more detailed than the Federal Free Exercise Clause, are perhaps the best evidence of the original understanding of the Constitution's protection of religious liberty. After all, it is reasonable to think that the States that ratified the First Amendment assumed that the meaning of the federal free exercise provision corresponded to that of their existing state clauses. The precise language of these state precursors to the Free Exercise Clause varied, but most guaranteed free exercise of religion or liberty of conscience, limited by particular, defined state interests. For example, the New York Constitution of 1777 provided:""[T]he free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever hereafter be allowed, within this State, to all mankind: Provided, That the liberty of conscience, hereby granted, shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of this State. "" N. Y. Const., Art. XXXVIII, in 7 Swindler 178 (emphasis added).Similarly, the New Hampshire Constitution of 1784 declared:""Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship GOD according to the dictates of his own conscience, and reason; and no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty or estate for worshipping GOD, in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience, . . . provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or disturb others,  in their religious worship."" N. H. Const., Art. I,  5, in 6 Swindler 345 (emphasis added).The Maryland Declaration of Rights of 1776 read:""[N]o person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion *554 or profession, or for his religious practice; unless, under colour of religion, any man shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others, in their natural, civil, or religious rights."" Md. Const., Declaration of Rights, Art. XXXIII in 4 Swindler 374 (emphasis added).The religious liberty clause of the Georgia Constitution of 1777 stated:""All persons whatever shall have the free exercise of their religion; provided it be not repugnant to the peace and safety of the State. "" Ga. Const., Art. LVI, in 2 Swindler 449 (emphasis added).In addition to these state provisions, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787which was enacted contemporaneously with the drafting of the Constitution and reenacted by the First Congressestablished a bill of rights for a territory that included what is now Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota. Article I of the Ordinance declared:""No person, demeaning himself in a peaceable and or- derly manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments, in the said territory."" Northwest Territory Ordinance of 1787, Art. I, 1 Stat. 52 (emphasis added).The language used in these state constitutional provisions and the Northwest Ordinance strongly suggests that, around the time of the drafting of the Bill of Rights, it was generally accepted that the right to ""free exercise"" required, where possible, accommodation of religious practice. If notand if the Court was correct in Smith that generally applicable laws are enforceable regardless of religious conscience there would have been no need for these documents to specify, as the New York Constitution did, that rights of conscience should not be ""construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace or safety of [the] State."" Such a proviso would have been superfluous. *555 Instead, these documents make sense only if the right to free exercise was viewed as generally superior to ordinary legislation, to be overridden only when necessary to secure important government purposes.

The Virginia Legislature may have debated the issue most fully. In May 1776, the Virginia Constitutional Convention wrote a constitution containing a Declaration of Rights with a clause on religious liberty. The initial drafter of the clause, George Mason, proposed the following:""That religion, or the duty which we owe to our CREATOR, and the manner of discharging it, can be (directed) only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore, that all men should enjoy the fullest toleration in the exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, unpunished and unrestrained by the magistrate, unless, under colour of reli- gion, any man disturb the peace, the happiness, or safety of society. And that it is the mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love, and charity towards each other."" Committee Draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, 1 Papers of George Mason 284 285 (R. Rutland ed. 1970) (emphasis added).Mason's proposal did not go far enough for a 26-year-old James Madison, who had recently completed his studies at the Presbyterian College of Princeton. He objected first to Mason's use of the term ""toleration,"" contending that the word implied that the right to practice one's religion was a governmental favor, rather than an inalienable liberty. Second, Madison thought Mason's proposal countenanced too much state interference in religious matters, since the ""exercise of religion"" would have yielded whenever it was deemed inimical to ""the peace, happiness, or safety of society."" Madison suggested the provision read instead:""`That religion, or the duty we owe our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, being under the direction *556 of reason and conviction only, not of violence or compulsion, all men are equally entitled to the full and free exercise of it, according to the dictates of conscience;  and therefore that no man or class of men ought on account of religion to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges, nor subjected to any penalties or disabilities, unless under color of religion the preserva- tion of equal liberty, and the existence of the State be manifestly endangered.' "" G. Hunt, James Madison and Religious Liberty, in 1 Annual Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 702, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., 163, 166-167 (1901) (emphasis added).Thus, Madison wished to shift Mason's language of ""toleration"" to the language of rights. See S. Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 492 (1902) (reprint 1970) (noting that Madison objected to the word ""toleration"" as belonging to ""a system where was an established Church, and where a certain liberty of worship was granted, not of right, but of grace""). Additionally, under Madison's proposal, the State could interfere in a believer's religious exercise only if the State would otherwise ""be manifestly endangered."" In the end, neither Mason's nor Madison's language regarding the extent to which state interests could limit religious exercise made it into the Virginia Constitution's religious liberty clause. Like the Federal Free Exercise Clause, the Virginia religious liberty clause was simply silent on the subject, providing only that ""all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience."" Virginia Declaration of Rights, Art. XVI (1776), in 10 Swindler 50. For our purposes, however, it is telling that both  Mason's and Madison's formulations envisioned that, when there was a conflict, a person's interest in freely practicing his religion was to be balanced against state interests. Although Madison endorsed a more limited state interest exception than did Mason, the debate would have been irrelevant if either had thought the right to free exercise did not *557 include a right to be exempt from certain generally applicable laws. Presumably, the Virginia Legislature intended the scope of its free exercise provision to strike some middle ground between Mason's narrower and Madison's broader notions of the right to religious freedom.DThe practice of the Colonies and early States bears out the conclusion that, at the time the Bill of Rights was ratified, it was accepted that government should, when possible, accommodate religious practice. Unsurprisingly, of course, even in the American Colonies inhabited by people of religious persuasions, religious conscience and civil law rarely conflicted. Most 17th and 18th century Americans belonged to denominations of Protestant Christianity whose religious practices were generally harmonious with colonial law. Curry, The First Freedoms, at 219 (""The vast majority of Americans assumed that theirs was a Christian, i. e. Protestant, country, and they automatically expected that government would uphold the commonly agreed on Protestant ethos and morality""). Moreover, governments then were far smaller and less intrusive than they are today, which made conflict between civil law and religion unusual.

Nevertheless, tension between religious conscience and generally applicable laws, though rare, was not unknown in preconstitutional America. Most commonly, such conflicts arose from oath requirements, military conscription, and religious assessments. Origins of Free Exercise 1466. The ways in which these conflicts were resolved suggest that Americans in the Colonies and early States thought that, if an individual's religious scruples prevented him from complying with a generally applicable law, the government should, if possible, excuse the person from the law's coverage. For example, Quakers and certain other Protestant sects refused on Biblical grounds to subscribe to oaths or ""swear"" allegiance to civil authority. A. Adams & C. Emmerich, *558 A Nation Dedicated to Religious Liberty: The Constitutional Heritage of the Religion Clauses 14 (1990) (hereinafter Adams & Emmerich). Without accommodation, their beliefs would have prevented them from participating in civic activities involving oaths, including testifying in court. Colonial governments created alternatives to the oath requirement for these individuals. In early decisions, for example, the Carolina proprietors applied the religious liberty provision of the Carolina Charter of 1665 to permit Quakers to enter pledges in a book. Curry, The First Freedoms, at 56. Similarly, in 1691, New York enacted a law allowing Quakers to testify by affirmation, and in 1734, it permitted Quakers to qualify to vote by affirmation. Id., at 64. By 1789, virtually all of the States had enacted oath exemptions. See Adams & Emmerich 62.

Early conflicts between religious beliefs and generally applicable laws also occurred because of military conscription requirements. Quakers and Mennonites, as well as a few smaller denominations, refused on religious grounds to carry arms. Members of these denominations asserted that liberty of conscience should exempt them from military conscription. Obviously, excusing such objectors from military service had a high public cost, given the importance of the military to the defense of society. Nevertheless, Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Maryland exempted Quakers from military service in the late 1600's. New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and New Hampshire followed suit in the mid-1700's. Origins of Free Exercise 1468. The Continental Congress likewise granted exemption from conscription:""As there are some people, who, from religious principles, cannot bear arms in any case, this Congress intend no violence to their consciences, but earnestly recommend it to them, to contribute liberally in this time of universal calamity, to the relief of their distressed brethren in the several colonies, and to do all other services to their oppressed Country, which they can consistently *559 with their religious principles."" Resolution of July 18, 1775, reprinted in 2 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789, pp. 187, 189 (W. Ford ed. 1905).Again, this practice of excusing religious pacifists from military service demonstrates that, long before the First Amendment was ratified, legislative accommodations were a common response to conflicts between religious practice and civil obligation. Notably, the Continental Congress exempted objectors from conscription to avoid ""violence to their consciences,"" explicitly recognizing that civil laws must sometimes give way to freedom of conscience. Origins of Free Exercise 1468.

States and Colonies with established churches encountered a further religious accommodation problem. Typically, these governments required citizens to pay tithes to support either the government-established church or the church to which the tithepayer belonged. But Baptists and Quakers, as well as others, opposed all governmentcompelled tithes on religious grounds. Id., at 1469. Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Virginia responded by exempting such objectors from religious assessments. Ibid. There are additional examples of early conflicts between civil laws and religious practice that were similarly settled through accommodation of religious exercise. Both North Carolina and Maryland excused Quakers from the requirement of removing their hats in court; Rhode Island exempted Jews from the requirements of the state marriage laws; and Georgia allowed groups of European immigrants to organize whole towns according to their own faith. Id., at 1471.

To be sure, legislatures, not courts, granted these early accommodations. But these were the days before there was  a Constitution to protect civil libertiesjudicial review did not yet exist. These legislatures apparently believed that the appropriate response to conflicts between civil law and religious scruples was, where possible, accommodation of religious *560 conduct. It is reasonable to presume that the drafters and ratifiers of the First Amendmentmany of whom served in state legislaturesassumed courts would apply the Free Exercise Clause similarly, so that religious liberty was safeguarded.EThe writings of the early leaders who helped to shape our Nation provide a final source of insight into the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clause. The thoughts of James Madisonone of the principal architects of the Bill of Rightsas revealed by the controversy surrounding Virginia's General Assessment Bill of 1784, are particularly illuminating. Virginia's debate over religious issues did not end with its adoption of a constitutional free exercise provision. Although Virginia had disestablished the Church of England in 1776, it left open the question whether religion might be supported on a nonpreferential basis by a so-called ""general assessment."" Levy, Essays on American Constitutional History, at 200. In the years between 1776 and 1784, the issue how to support religion in Virginiaeither by general assessment or voluntarilywas widely debated. Curry, The First Freedoms, at 136.

By 1784, supporters of a general assessment, led by Patrick Henry, had gained a slight majority in the Virginia Assembly. M. Malbin, Religion and Politics: The Intentions of the Authors of the First Amendment 23 (1978); Levy, supra,  at 200. They introduced ""A Bill Establishing a Provision for the Teachers of the Christian Religion,"" which proposed that citizens be taxed in order to support the Christian denomination of their choice, with those taxes not designated for any specific denomination to go to a public fund to aid seminaries. Levy, supra, at 200-201; Curry, supra, at 140 141; Malbin, supra, at 23. Madison viewed religious assessment as a dangerous infringement of religious liberty and led the opposition to the bill. He took the case against religious assessment to the people of Virginia in his now-famous ""Memorial *561 and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments."" Levy, supra, at 201. This pamphlet led thousands of Virginians to oppose the bill and to submit petitions expressing their views to the legislature. Malbin, supra, at 24. The bill eventually died in committee, and Virginia instead enacted a Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which Thomas Jefferson had drafted in 1779. Malbin, supra, at 24.

The ""Memorial and Remonstrance"" begins with the recognition that ""[t]he Religion ... of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate."" 2 Writings of James Madison 184 (G. Hunt ed. 1901). By its very nature, Madison wrote, the right to free exercise is ""unalienable,"" both because a person's opinion ""cannot follow the dictates of other[s],"" and because it entails ""a duty towards the Creator."" Ibid. Madison continued:""This duty [owed the Creator] is precedent both in order of time and degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. . . . [E]very man who becomes a member of any particular Civil Society, [must] do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance."" Id., at 184-185.To Madison, then, duties to God were superior to duties to civil authoritiesthe ultimate loyalty was owed to God above all. Madison did not say that duties to the Creator are precedent only to those laws specifically directed at religion, nor did he strive simply to prevent deliberate acts of persecution or discrimination. The idea that civil obligations are subordinate to religious duty is consonant with the notion that government must accommodate, where possible, those religious practices that conflict with civil law.

*562 Other early leaders expressed similar views regarding religious liberty. Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of Virginia's Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, wrote in that document that civil government could interfere in religious exercise only ""when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order."" In 1808, he indicated that he considered ""`the government of the United States as interdicted by the Constitution from intermeddling with religious institutions, their doctrines, discipline, or exercises.' "" 11 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 428-429 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1904) (quoted in Office of Legal Policy, U. S. Dept. of Justice, Report to the Attorney General, Religious Liberty under the Free Exercise Clause 7 (1986)). Moreover, Jefferson believed that ""`[e]very religious society has a right to determine for itself the time of these exercises, and the objects proper for them, according to their own particular tenets; and this right can never be safer than in their own hands, where the Constitution has deposited it.' "" Ibid.

George Washington expressly stated that he believed that government should do its utmost to accommodate religious scruples, writing in a letter to a group of Quakers:""[I]n my opinion the conscientious scruples of all men should be treated with great delicacy and tenderness; and it is my wish and desire, that the laws may always be as extensively accommodated to them, as a due regard to the protection and essential interests of the nation may justify and permit."" Letter from George Washington to the Religious Society Called Quakers (Oct. 1789), in George Washington on Religious Liberty and Mutual Understanding 11 (E. Humphrey ed. 1932).Oliver Ellsworth, a Framer of the First Amendment and later Chief Justice of the United States, expressed the similar view that government could interfere in religious matters only when necessary ""to prohibit and punish gross immoralities *563 and impieties; because the open practice of these is of evil example and detriment."" Oliver Ellsworth, Landholder, No. 7 (Dec. 17, 1787), reprinted in 4 Founders' Constitution 640. Isaac Backus, a Baptist minister who was a delegate to the Massachusetts ratifying convention of 1788, declared that ""`every person has an unalienable right to act in all religious affairs according to the full persuasion of his own mind, where others are not injured thereby.' "" Backus, A Declaration of Rights, of the Inhabitants of the State of Massachusetts-Bay, in Isaac Backus on Church, State, and Calvinism 487 (W. McLoughlin ed. 1968).

These are but a few examples of various perspectives regarding the proper relationship between church and government that existed during the time the First Amendment was drafted and ratified. Obviously, since these thinkers approached the issue of religious freedom somewhat differently, see Adams & Emmerich 21-31, it is not possible to distill their thoughts into one tidy formula. Nevertheless, a few general principles may be discerned. Foremost, these early leaders accorded religious exercise a special constitutional status. The right to free exercise was a substantive guarantee of individual liberty, no less important than the right to free speech or the right to just compensation for the taking of property. See P. Kauper, Religion and the Constitution 17 (1964) (""[O]ur whole constitutional history . . . supports the conclusion that religious liberty is an independent liberty, that its recognition may either require or permit preferential treatment on religious grounds in some instances . . . ""). As Madison put it in the concluding argument of his ""Memorial and Remonstrance"":""`[T]he equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion according to the dictates of [his] conscience' is held by the same tenure with all our other rights. . . . [I]t is equally the gift of nature; . . . it cannot be less dear to us; . . . it is enumerated with equal solemnity, *564 or rather studied emphasis."" 2 Writings of James Madison, at 190.Second, all agreed that government interference in religious practice was not to be lightly countenanced. Adams & Emmerich 31. Finally, all shared the conviction that ""`true religion and good morals are the only solid foundation of public liberty and happiness.' "" Curry, The First Freedoms, at 219 (quoting Continental Congress); see Adams & Emmerich 72 (""The Founders . . . acknowledged that the republic rested largely on moral principles derived from religion""). To give meaning to these ideasparticularly in a society characterized by religious pluralism and pervasive regulationthere will be times when the Constitution requires government to accommodate the needs of those citizens whose religious practices conflict with generally applicable law.IIIThe Religion Clauses of the Constitution represent a profound commitment to religious liberty. Our Nation's Founders conceived of a Republic receptive to voluntary religious expression, not of a secular society in which religious expression is tolerated only when it does not conflict with a generally applicable law. As the historical sources discussed above show, the Free Exercise Clause is properly understood as an affirmative guarantee of the right to participate in religious activities without impermissible governmental interference, even where a believer's conduct is in tension with a law of general application. Certainly, it is in no way anomalous to accord heightened protection to a right identified in the text of the First Amendment. For example, it has long been the Court's position that freedom of speecha right enumerated only a few words after the right to free exercisehas special constitutional status. Given the centrality of freedom of speech and religion to the American concept of personal liberty, it is altogether reasonable to conclude *565 that both should be treated with the highest degree of respect.

Although it may provide a bright line, the rule the Court declared in Smith does not faithfully serve the purpose of the Constitution. Accordingly, I believe that it is essential for the Court to reconsider its holding in Smith and to do so in this very case. I would therefore direct the parties to brief this issue and set the case for reargument.

I respectfully dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.Justice Souter, dissenting.To decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment gives Congress sufficient power to enact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, the Court measures the legislation against the free-exercise standard of Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990). For the reasons stated in my opinion in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520, 564-577 (1993) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), I have serious doubts about the precedential value of the Smith rule and its entitlement to adherence. These doubts are intensified today by the historical arguments going to the original understanding of the Free Exercise Clause presented in Justice O'Connor's dissent, ante, at 548-564, which raises very substantial issues about the soundness of the Smith rule. See also ante, p. 537 (Justice Scalia, concurring in part) (addressing historical arguments). But without briefing and argument on the merits of that rule (which this Court has never had in any case, including Smith itself, see Lukumi, 508 U. S., at 571-572), I am not now prepared to join Justice O'Connor in rejecting it or the majority in assuming it to be correct. In order to provide full adversarial consideration, this case should be set down for reargument permitting plenary reexamination of the issue. Since the Court declines to follow that course, our free-exercise *566 law remains marked by an ""intolerable tension,"" id., at 574, and the constitutionality of the Act of Congress to enforce the free-exercise right cannot now be soundly decided. I would therefore dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, and I accordingly dissent from the Court's disposition of this case.Justice Breyer, dissenting.I agree with Justice O'Connor that the Court should direct the parties to brief the question whether Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), was correctly decided, and set this case for reargument. I do not, however, find it necessary to consider the question whether, assuming Smith is correct,  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment would authorize Congress to enact the legislation before us. Thus, while I agree with some of the views expressed in the first paragraph of Part I of Justice O'Connor's dissent, I do not necessarily agree with all of them. I therefore join Justice O'Connor's dissent, with the exception of the first paragraph of Part I.NOTES[*]   Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Commonwealth of Virginia by James S.

Recently I've been thinking of you
My great-grandchild
How insane it became to explain what we're going through
And these days my mind can run wild
So I thought it would better if I wrote it in a letter to you

Dear great-grand kids
I wanna try to explain what we did to your planet
And damn it, I know it's hard to understand it
But the fact is, we failed to take action and
Acted like manic generational bandits
And I'm sure you gotta couple of questions like
What were you thinking and what was your intention
But, sadly this message is just a confession about
How we failеd the test and nevеr learned our damn lesson

You know your ancestors worked in the coal mine
Never havin' money, never had time
Never see the sun, poisoning the land with the fumble
Mostly die from black lung, just to provide for they young and

Now everybody thinkin' that we doing all the best that we can
We, do it for our families
Never understanding what we did
(You can't starve your grand-children, just to feed your kids)

And even though there's many souls, with many eyes
They'll never know, never know it's there at all
It's clear to me that I could see, that they tried
Just know tonight, it's in the writing on the wall
It's in the writing on the wall

While I appreciate the thought of it
Your world sounds beautiful but you left us the opposite
All these floods and famines, you could've stopped a lot of it
You had the opportunity, but you just kept dropping it
You might also likeAll I'm saying is I wish we still had bees
Or maybe I could've climbed in a real tree
Or dove down deep on a living coral reef
And stared in disbelief beneath an unpolluted sea

We are not here to exploit, we were created to love it
It's not too late for you to rise above it
Feel the cries through time of generational justice

Only you will know what you did
When the tides came by, whether you fought or you hid
Only you will know what you did
Cause you can't starve your grand-children just to feed your kids

And even though there's many souls, with many eyes
They'll never know, never know it's there at all
It's clear to me that I could see, that they tried
Just know tonight, it's in the writing on the wall

Even though there's many souls, with many eyes
Who'd never know, never know it's there at all
It's clear to me that we could change it if we tried
Just you and I, we write the writing on the wall
We write the writing on the wallEmbed"

If I may, I'd like to pose an interesting question
How could it be possible to love a person like me?
Do you mean that?

[Verse 1]
Open up an umbrella
Sipping purple rain, stepping in Margiela
I been addicted to this pain, yeah, she the seller
But when I look into your eyes I hope this could last forever
Out my mind, she ain't wasting time
She tryna get it done, she just waiting 'til I die
I know shawty jobless, but she look flawless
Now, where'd you get that monеy? Come on, be honest
[Chorus]
Stay out of thе rain (Stay out of the rain)
All it brings is pain (All it brings is pain)
I'll never be the same (I'll never be the same)
Stay out of the rain
I don't know how to feel
But I know that it's falling apart
She don't even know what she doing
But she breaking my heart
Number nine, all the time
Now she falling in line
Yeah, I'm fine
Thanks for asking, I'm just losing my mind

[Verse 2]
Put it all on the line for your love
I know that it ain't enough
I know you don't give a fuck
I thought we were working on trust
Look alive, look in your eyes
But I know they always lie
I put everything on the line
Ask how I'm doing, yeah, I'm fine
Wrote a love letter to you, fuck you
I don't wanna choose
Oh, I never lose
Get out of my head
I know you wish that I was dead
How am I not dead?
I'll fall in love instead
You might also like[Chorus]
Stay out of the rain (Stay out of the rain)
All it brings is pain (All it brings is pain)
I'll never be the same (I'll never be the same)
Stay out of the rain (Stay out of the rain)
I don't know how to feel
But I know that it's falling apart
She don't even know what she doing
But she breaking my heart
Number nine, all the time
Now she falling in line
Yeah, I'm fine
Thanks for asking I'm just losing my mind

[Outro]
I don't know how to feel
But I know that it's falling apart
She don't even know what she doing
Breaking my heart
Number nine, all the time
Now she falling in line

        ""The most private, secret, plainest wedding that it is possible to have.""

        Those had been Bathsheba's words to Oak one evening, some time after the event of the preceding chapter, and he meditated a full hour by the clock upon how to carry out her wishes to the letter.

        ""A license—O yes, it must be a license,"" he said to himself at last. ""Very well, then; first, a license.""

        On a dark night, a few days later, Oak came with mysterious steps from the surrogate's door, in Casterbridge. On the way home he heard a heavy tread in front of him, and, overtaking the man, found him to be Coggan. They walked together into the village until they came to a little lane behind the church, leading down to the cottage of Laban Tall, who had lately been installed as clerk of the parish, and was yet in mortal terror at church on Sundays when he heard his lone voice among certain hard words of the Psalms, whither no man ventured to follow him.

        ""Well, good-night, Coggan,"" said Oak, ""I'm going down this way.""
        ""Oh!"" said Coggan, surprised; ""what's going on to-night then, make so bold Mr. Oak?""

        It seemed rather ungenerous not to tell Coggan, under the circumstances, for Coggan had been true as steel all through the time of Gabriel's unhappiness about Bathsheba, and Gabriel said, ""You can keep a secret, Coggan?""

        ""You've proved me, and you know.""

        ""Yes, I have, and I do know. Well, then, mistress and I mean to get married to-morrow morning.""

        ""Heaven's high tower! And yet I've thought of such a thing from time to time; true, I have. But keeping it so close! Well, there, 'tis no consarn of of mine, and I wish 'ee joy o' her.""

        ""Thank you, Coggan. But I assure 'ee that this great hush is not what I wished for at all, or what either of us would have wished if it hadn't been for certain things that would make a gay wedding seem hardly the thing. Bathsheba has a great wish that all the parish shall not be in church, looking at her—she's shy-like and nervous about it, in fact—so I be doing this to humour her.""

        ""Ay, I see: quite right, too, I suppose I must say. And you be now going down to the clerk.""

        ""Yes; you may as well come with me.""

        ""I am afeard your labour in keeping it close will be throwed away,"" said Coggan, as they walked along. ""Labe Tall's old woman will horn it all over parish in half-an-hour.""

        ""So she will, upon my life; I never thought of that,"" said Oak, pausing. ""Yet I must tell him to-night, I suppose, for he's working so far off, and leaves early.""

        ""I'll tell 'ee how we could tackle her,"" said Coggan. ""I'll knock and ask to speak to Laban outside the door, you standing in the background. Then he'll come out, and you can tell yer tale. She'll never guess what I want en for; and I'll make up a few words about the farm-work, as a blind.""

        This scheme was considered feasible; and Coggan advanced boldly, and rapped at Mrs. Tall's door. Mrs. Tall herself opened it.

        ""I wanted to have a word with Laban.""
        ""He's not at home, and won't be this side of eleven o'clock. He've been forced to go over to Yalbury since shutting out work. I shall do quite as well.""

        ""I hardly think you will. Stop a moment;"" and Coggan stepped round the corner of the porch to consult Oak.

        ""Who's t'other man, then?"" said Mrs. Tall.

        ""Only a friend,"" said Coggan.

        ""Say he's wanted to meet mistress near church-hatch to-morrow morning at ten,"" said Oak, in a whisper. ""That he must come without fail, and wear his best clothes.""

        ""The clothes will floor us as safe as houses!"" said Coggan.

        ""It can't be helped,"" said Oak. ""Tell her.""

        So Coggan delivered the message. ""Mind, het or wet, blow or snow, he must come,"" added Jan. ""'Tis very particular, indeed. The fact is, 'tis to witness her sign some law-work about taking shares wi' another farmer for a long span o' years. There, that's what 'tis, and now I've told 'ee, Mother Tall, in a way I shouldn't ha' done if I hadn't loved 'ee so hopeless well.""

        Coggan retired before she could ask any further; and next they called at the vicar's in a manner which excited no curiosity at all. Then Gabriel went home, and prepared for the morrow.

        ""Liddy,"" said Bathsheba, on going to bed that night, ""I want you to call me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I shouldn't wake.""

        ""But you always do wake afore then, ma'am.""

        ""Yes, but I have something important to do, which I'll tell you of when the time comes, and it's best to make sure.""

        Bathsheba, however, awoke voluntarily at four, nor could she by any contrivance get to sleep again. About six, being quite positive that her watch had stopped during the night, she could wait no longer. She went and tapped at Liddy's door, and after some labour awoke her.
        ""But I thought it was I who had to call you?"" said the bewildered Liddy. ""And it isn't six yet.""

        ""Indeed it is; how can you tell such a story, Liddy? I know it must be ever so much past seven. Come to my room as soon as you can; I want you to give my hair a good brushing.""

        When Liddy came to Bathsheba's room her mistress was already waiting. Liddy could not understand this extraordinary promptness. ""Whatever is going on, ma'am?"" she said.

        ""Well, I'll tell you,"" said Bathsheba, with a mischievous smile in her bright eyes. ""Farmer Oak is coming here to dine with me to-day!""

        ""Farmer Oak—and nobody else?—you two alone?""

        ""Yes.""

        ""But is it safe, ma'am, after what's been said?"" asked her companion, dubiously. ""A woman's good name is such a perishable article that—""

        Bathsheba laughed with a flushed cheek, and whispered in Liddy's ear, although there was nobody present. Then Liddy stared and exclaimed, ""Souls alive, what news! It makes my heart go quite bumpity-bump!""

        ""It makes mine rather furious, too,"" said Bathsheba. ""However, there's no getting out of it now!""

        It was a damp disagreeable morning. Nevertheless, at twenty minutes to ten o'clock, Oak came out of his house, and

         Went up the hill side
         With that sort of stride
         A man puts out when walking in search of a bride,

        and knocked Bathsheba's door. Ten minutes later a large and a smaller umbrella might have been seen moving from the same door, and through the mist along the road to the church. The distance was not more than a quarter of a mile, and these two sensible persons deemed it unnecessary to drive. An observer must have been very close indeed to discover that the forms under the umbrellas were those of Oak and Bathsheba, arm-in-arm for the first time in their lives, Oak in a greatcoat extending to his knees, and Bathsheba in a cloak that reached her clogs. Yet, though so plainly dressed, there was a certain rejuvenated appearance about her:—

         As though a rose should shut and be a bud again.

        Repose had again incarnadined her cheeks; and having, at Gabriel's request, arranged her hair this morning as she had worn it years ago on Norcombe Hill, she seemed in his eyes remarkably like a girl of that fascinating dream, which, considering that she was now only three or four-and-twenty, was perhaps not very wonderful. In the church were Tall, Liddy, and the parson, and in a remarkably short space of time the deed was done.

        The two sat down very quietly to tea in Bathsheba's parlour in the evening of the same day, for it had been arranged that Farmer Oak should go there to live, since he had as yet neither money, house, nor furniture worthy of the name, though he was on a sure way towards them, whilst Bathsheba was, comparatively, in a plethora of all three.

        Just as Bathsheba was pouring out a cup of tea, their ears were greeted by the firing of a cannon, followed by what seemed like a tremendous blowing of trumpets, in the front of the house.

        ""There!"" said Oak, laughing, ""I knew those fellows were up to something, by the look on their faces""

        Oak took up the light and went into the porch, followed by Bathsheba with a shawl over her head. The rays fell upon a group of male figures gathered upon the gravel in front, who, when they saw the newly-married couple in the porch, set up a loud ""Hurrah!"" and at the same moment bang again went the cannon in the background, followed by a hideous clang of music from a drum, tambourine, clarionet, serpent, hautboy, tenor-viol, and double-bass—the only remaining relics of the true and original Weatherbury band—venerable worm-eaten instruments, which had celebrated in their own persons the victories of Marlborough, under the fingers of the forefathers of those who played them now. The performers came forward, and marched up to the front.

        ""Those bright boys, Mark Clark and Jan, are at the bottom of all this,"" said Oak. ""Come in, souls, and have something to eat and drink wi' me and my wife.""

        ""Not to-night,"" said Mr. Clark, with evident self-denial. ""Thank ye all the same; but we'll call at a more seemly time. However, we couldn't think of letting the day pass without a note of admiration of some sort. If ye could send a drop of som'at down to Warren's, why so it is. Here's long life and happiness to neighbour Oak and his comely bride!""

        ""Thank ye; thank ye all,"" said Gabriel. ""A bit and a drop shall be sent to Warren's for ye at once. I had a thought that we might very likely get a salute of some sort from our old friends, and I was saying so to my wife but now.""

        ""Faith,"" said Coggan, in a critical tone, turning to his companions, ""the man hev learnt to say 'my wife' in a wonderful naterel way, considering how very youthful he is in wedlock as yet—hey, neighbours all?""

        ""I never heerd a skilful old married feller of twenty years' standing pipe 'my wife' in a more used note than 'a did,"" said Jacob Smallbury. ""It might have been a little more true to nater if't had been spoke a little chillier, but that wasn't to be expected just now.""

        ""That improvement will come wi' time,"" said Jan, twirling his eye.

        Then Oak laughed, and Bathsheba smiled (for she never laughed readily now), and their friends turned to go.

        ""Yes; I suppose that's the size o't,"" said Joseph Poorgrass with a cheerful sigh as they moved away; ""and I wish him joy o' her; though I were once or twice upon saying to-day with holy Hosea, in my scripture manner, which is my second nature, 'Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.' But since 'tis as 'tis, why, it might have been worse, and I feel my thanks accordingly.""Embed"

By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream
There's no reason to hurry
Just start that brand new story
Set it alight
We're head over heels in love
Head over heels
The ringing of your laughter
It sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places
We'll go for a while

It's the definite show
Our shadows resting in the moonlight
It's so clear and bright in your eyes
It's the touch of your sighs
My lips are resting on your shoulder
When we're moving so soft and slow
We need the ecstasy, the jealousy, the comedy of love
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before
Give me more tragedy, more harmony and fantasy, my dear
And set it alight
Just starting that satellite

There is something
In the air tonight
I'm gonna burn your house
And bury you inside

The worst of all from coast to coast

You know
Suicide and life
Are peachy conversations
Based around
This fantasy that we'll never evolve
Can't say I welcome it
Into my life
Those tasteless kisses
You pushed upon my cheek
Me ruining
All hope of that new crush
Now is exposed
It makes the children ill

How about we taunt them with a flick
A wave like motion
With the finger of
Pointing capability

I wish for a state of
Isolation
And a sense of
Nothingness

Plain and boring
But just enough to
Keep me from straying

When learning how to crawl became a substitute for walking
Biting my tongue a fair exchange for talking to myself
Knocking pictures off the shelf and swallowing the frames
Spilling wine to comment on the stain

I need a mind erase option, less air to the brain
If God was alive he would've amended us
But then again no one has it as bad as I have or ever will
To the extent that if I have to finish this
I might have to leave everything else undone
And it's all numb anyway
I can see our life before my eyes and it looks real
Sunrise; an easy thing to steal
I'll drive! I'm best behind the wheel
Besides, I get confused and I'll need you to navigate
The complicated courts and lanes that crowd this place
I swear to God the street signs change when my eyes close
They're not the same

Know all of the lines because I'd authored all the hardest
But I didn't have the will, so I don't know why I started
These empty ribs still have no room to fit a proper heart in
So if all you want are flowers, then just plant yourself a garden
Don't rely on me

Quit calling me to remind me I have many ways
To remember all those things
And even now I cling to them, it's sad

It was a cycle to and from a distance
To spark a fire we once ignited, we once engaged

One, Two, Three, I count out loud
To figure out what lays ahead, its game or death
This road ahead got burned by a spark to fire
With nothing left but a bitter end

Let's move this floor side to side
We got to run away there chasing everything I say
The hope is gone
Cycles will kill us all
I'll bring you back to life with a simple dying wish
You let me know how it feels to be in hell
Because I'll never know be sure to write
But don't leave any words behind

She counts out loud just to figure out
If this road ahead is game or death
She's broken down these voices of
The kisses through the night

They broke down voices with kisses on through the night
It was a cycle to and from a distance we never had

Navego en barcos de papel, pero ninguno me lleva a buen puerto
Te dije: ""Todo saldrá bien"", lo que no te dije es que no era cierto

[Verso 1: Brock]
Tan versátil que apenas me reconozco
Mi verdad es un taladro al lado de un cuadro de el bosco
Si me callo es para no sentirme un monstruo
Si te echará todo en cara te haría falta más de un rostro

No te preocupes si en mis ojos notas sangre
Maté al abecedario estoy llorando un plan B
Veo a esos niños haciendo frees en el parque
Y les digo: soy vosotros pero pensando engrande

Descomprimo sentimientos llámame Winzip
Pero cambia el punto .Rar por un punto .RIP
99 problemas igual que Jay-Z
Y llegó a los 100 en el momento en que me cuento a mí

Si quieres tirarme beef te dejo dos opciones
O escribir así o dedicarte a las vídeo reacciones
Desde cuando los Mc's comentan sus renglones
Mohamed Alí hablaba en el ring no en las repeticiones

Se que la vida es un toque, la muerte es un golpe
El amor un torpe y el hate del deporte más tonto
Tengo más choques que enfoques más fuegos que bosques
Más cortes que cortex, mas por ques es que pokers lo afronto

Y si piensas que soy blando por los versos que derramamo
Mira ahí fuera y luego dime si no hace falta aún “Te amo”

Me siento raro como un OVNI en la acera
De mi próxima hoguera sería un coxis de cera
Ya tengo claro que la desdicha me espera
Si elegí tocar el alma en vez de tocar madera

[Verso 2: Khan]
Ah, yo
Aquí los poetas callan sueños y hacen letras
Mi corazón un teatro y el público lo interpreta
Marcha atrás al mundo dando tumbos en glorietas
El día que dios me dio no puso amor en la receta
Entre flores mustias secas, jardines podridos
Lo mejor que hicimos ser como desconocidos
Navego un volante bergantín sin ser marino
Porque embargos de papel todo escritor es bienvenido

Resto, fuera de mi all-in pero me resto
Nada que perder si yo no me apuesto
Visto un traje negro por saber que lo que espero no es bonito
El fin justifica los medios pero esto es infinito

Y ahora bebo Brugal como un pirata atormentado
Por andar en mar helado de cantar enamorado
Si los océanos se mueren por las lágrimas que trago
Cada desamor que tuve pude darle nombre a un lago

Tirado en la arena y en mi diestra una botella
Lanzándole un S.O.S, esas olas se la llevan
Ahora podrán encontrarme seco esperando que muera
Pero ya eran más de lo que pude yo en mi vida entera

Mira esos niños ya se creen dioses drogándose
Perderán la fe viendo sus madres lamentándose
Que aquí todos mueren jóvenes enamorados de dólares
Sin prestar atención alrededor sé que mi labor es…

Hacer mi música, volcarme en mis historias
Que fuera ahi fuera las personas solo cuentan sus victorias
La vida es opcional pero la muerte obligatoria
Cumplir la meta no enseña lo que hace la trayectoria

Poeta en rigor mortis no de ránkings…
Escribo lo que devolví no sé cómo tragar mis
Ganas de sacar todo este drama sobre otro lápiz
Por miedo de llorar y deshacer papel del mátstil

En especial hace relación de una grandísima provincia muy rica, llamada Culúa, en la cual hay muy grandes ciudades y de maravillosos edificios y de grandes tratos y riquezas, entre las cuales hay una más maravillosa y rica que todas, llamada Tenustitlan, que está, por maravilloso arte, edificada sobre una grande laguna; de la cual ciudad y provincia es rey un grandísimo señor llamado Mutezuma; donde le acaecieron al capitán y a los españoles espantosas cosas de oír. Cuenta largamente del grandísimo señorío del dicho Mutezuma, y de sus ritos y ceremonias y de cómo se sirven.

Muy alto y poderoso y muy católico príncipe, invictísimo emperador y señor nuestro:

En una nao que de esta Nueva España de vuestra sacra majestad despaché a diez y seis días de julio del año de quinientos y diez y nueve, envié a vuestra Alteza muy larga y particular relación de las cosas hasta aquella sazón, después que yo a ella vine, en ella sucedidas. La cual relación llevaron Alonso Hernández Portocarrero y Francisco de Montejo, Procuradores de la Rica Villa de la Vera Cruz, que yo el nombre de vuestra alteza fundé.

Y después acá, por no haber oportunidad, así por falta de navíos y estar yo ocupado en la conquista y pacificación de esta tierra, como por no haber sabido de la dicha nao y procuradores, no he tornado a relatar a vuestra majestad lo que después se ha hecho; de que Dios sabe la pena que he tenido. Porque he deseado que vuestra alteza supiese las cosas de esta tierra, que son tantas y tales que, como ya en la otra relación escribí se puede intitular de nuevo emperador de ella, y con título y no menos mérito que el de Alemaña, que por la gracia de Dios vuestra sacra majestad posee. Y porque querer de todas las cosas de estas partes y nuevos reinos de vuestra alteza decir todas las particularidades y cosas que en ellas hay y decir se debían, sería casi proceder a infinito.

Si de todo a vuestra alteza no diere tan larga cuenta como debo, a vuestra sacra majestad suplico me mande perdonar; porque ni mi habilidad, ni la oportunidad del tiempo en que a la sazón me hallo para ello me ayudan. Mas con todo, me esforzaré a decir a vuestra alteza lo menos mal que yo pudiere, la verdad y lo que al presente es necesario que vuestra majestad sepa. Y asimismo suplico a vuestra alteza me mande perdonar si todo lo necesario no contare, el cuándo y cómo muy cierto, y si no acertare algunos nombres, así de ciudades y villas como de señoríos de ellas, que a vuestra majestad han ofrecido su servicio y dádose por sus súbditos y vasallos. Porque en cierto infortunio ahora nuevamente acaecido, de que adelante en el proceso a vuestra alteza daré entera cuenta, se me perdieron todas las escrituras y autos que con los naturales de estas tierras yo he hecho, y otras muchas cosas.
En la otra relación, muy excelentísimo Príncipe, dije a vuestra majestad las ciudades y villas que hasta entonces a su real servicio se habían ofrecido y yo a él tenía sujetas y conquistadas. Y dije así mismo que tenía noticia de un gran señor que se llamaba Mutezuma, que los naturales de esta tierra me habían dicho que en ella había, que estaba, según ellos señalaban las jornadas, hasta noventa o ciento leguas de la costa y puerto donde yo desembarqué. Y que confiado en la grandeza de Dios y con esfuerzo del real nombre de vuestra alteza, pensara irle a ver a doquiera que estuviese, y aun me acuerdo que me ofrecí, en cuanto a la demanda de este señor, a mucho más de lo a mí posible, porque certifiqué a vuestra alteza que lo habría, preso o muerto, o súbdito a la corona real de vuestra majestad'.

Y con este propósito y demanda me partí de la ciudad de Cempoal, que yo intitulé Sevilla, a diez y seis de agosto, con quince de bailo y trescientos peones lo mejor aderezados de guerra que yo pude y el tiempo dio a ello lugar, y dejé en la Villa de la Vera Cruz ciento y cincuenta hombres con dos de caballo, haciendo una fortaleza que ya tengo casi acabada; y dejé toda aquella provincia de Cempoal toda la sierra comercana a la villa, que serán hasta cincuenta mil hombres de guerra y cincuenta villas y fortalezas, muy seguros y pacifico y por ciertos y leales vasallos de vuestra majestad, como hasta ahora lo han estado y están, porque ellos eran súbditos de aquel señor Mutezuma, y según fui informado lo era por fuerza y de poco tiempo acá.

Y como por mí tuvieron noticias de vuestra alteza y de su muy grande y real poder, dijeron que querían ser vasallos de vuestra majestad y mis amigos, y que me rogaban que los defendiese de aquel gran señor que los tenía por fuerza y tiranía, y que les tomaba sus hijos para los matar y sacrificar a sus ídolos. Y me dijeron otras muchas quejas de él, y con esto han estado y están muy ciertos y leales en servicio de vuestra alteza y creo lo estarán siempre por ser libres la tiranía de aquél, y porque de mí han sido siempre bien tratados favorecidos. Y para más seguridad de los que en la villa quedaba traje conmigo algunas personas principales de ellos con alguna ge te, que no poco provechosos me fueron en mi camino.

Y porque, como ya creo, en la primera relación escribí a vuestra majestad que algunos de los que en mi compañía pasaron, que eran criados y amigos de Diego Velázquez, les había pesado de lo que yo en servicio de vuestra alteza hacía, y aun algunos de ellos se me quisieron alzar e írseme de la tierra, en especial cuatro españoles que se decían Juan Escudero y Diego Cermeño, piloto, y Gonzalo de Ungría, así mismo piloto, y Alonso Peñate, los cuales, según lo que confesaron espontáneamente, tenían determinado de tomar un bergantín que estaba en el puerto, con cierto pan y tocinos, y matar al maestre de él, e irse a la isla Fernandina a hacer saber a Diego Velázquez cómo yo enviaba la nao que a vuestra alteza envié y lo que en ella iba y el camino que la dicha nao había de llevar, para que el dicho Diego Velázquez pusiese navíos en guarda para que la tomasen, como después que lo supo lo puso por obra, que según he sido informado envió tras la dicha nao una carabela. Y así mismo confesaron que otras personas tenían la misma voluntad de avisar al dicho Diego Velázquez; y vistas las confesiones de estos delincuentes los castigué conforme a justicia y a lo que según el tiempo me pareció que había necesidad y al servicio de vuestra alteza cumplía.

Y porque demás de los que por ser criados y amigos de Diego Velázquez tenían voluntad de se salir de la tierra, había otros que por verla tan grande y de tanta gente y tal, y ver los pocos españoles que éramos, estaban del mismo propósito, creyendo que si allí los navíos dejase, se me alzarían con ellos, y yéndose todos los que de esta voluntad estaban, yo quedaría casi solo, por donde se estorbara el gran servicio que a Dios y a vuestra alteza en esa tierra se ha hecho, tu manera como, so color que los dichos navíos no estaban para navegar, los eché a la costa por donde todos perdieron la esperanza de salir de la tierra. Y yo hice mi camino más seguro y sin sospechas q vueltas las espaldas no había de faltarme la gente que yo en la vi había de dejar.

Ocho o diez días después de haber dado con los navíos a la costa y siendo ya salido de la Vera Cruz hasta la ciudad de Cempoal, q está a cuatro leguas de ella, para de allí seguir mi camino, me hicieron saber de la dicha villa cómo por la costa de ella andaban cuatro navíos, y que el capitán que yo allí dejaba había salido de ellos con una barca, y les había dicho que eran de Francisco de Garay"", Teniente y Gobernador en la isla de Jamaica, y que venían a descubrir; y que el dicho capitán les había dicho cómo yo en nombre de vuestra alteza tenía poblada esta tierra y hecha una villa allí, a una legua de donde los dichos navíos andaban, y que allí podían ir con ellos y me harían saber de su venida, y si alguna necesidad trajesen se podrían reparar de ella, y que el dicho capitán los guiaría con la barca al puerto, el cual les señaló donde era. Y que a eso les había respondido que ya habían visto el puerto, porque pasaron por frente de él, y que así lo harían como 61 me lo decía; y que se había vuelto con la dicha barca; y los navíos no le habían seguido ni venido al puerto y que todavía andaban por la costa y que no sabía qué era su propósito pues no habían venido al dicho puerto.

Y visto lo que el dicho capitán me hizo saber, a la hora me partí para la dicha villa, donde supe que los dichos navíos estaban surtos tres leguas la costa abajo, y que ninguno no había saltado en tierra. Y de allí me fui por la costa con alguna gente para saber lengua, y ya que casi llegaba a una legua de ellos encontré con tres hombres de los dichos navíos entre los cuales venia uno que decía ser escribano, y los dos traían, según me dijo, para que fuesen testigos de cierta notificación, que dizque el capitán le había mandado que me hiciese de su parte un requerimiento que allí traía, en el cual se contenía que me hacía saber como él había descubierto aquella tierra y quería poblar en ella.

Por tanto, que me requería que partiese con él los términos, porque su asiento quería ser cinco leguas la costa abajo, después de pasada Nautecal, que es una ciudad que es doce leguas de la dicha villa, que ahora se llama Almería, a los cuales yo dije que viniese su capitán y que se fuese con los navíos al puerto de la Vera Cruz y que allí nos hablaríamos y sabría de qué manera venían, y si sus navíos y gente trajesen alguna necesidad, les socorrería con lo que yo pudiese, y que pues él decía venir en servicio de vuestra sacra majestad, que yo no deseaba otra cosa sino que se me ofreciese en q sirviese a vuestra alteza, y que en le ayudar creía que lo hacía.

Ellos me respondieron que en ninguna manera el capitán ni o gente vendría a tierra ni adonde yo estuviese, y creyendo que debí de haber hecho algún daño en la tierra, pues se recelaban de ve ante mí, ya que era noche me puse secretamente junto a la costa la mar, frontero de donde los dichos navíos estaban surtos, y allí eme` tuve en cubierto hasta otro día casi a medio día, creyendo que el capitán o piloto saltarían en tierra, para saber de ellos lo que habían andado, y si algún daño hubiesen hecho en la tierra, enviarlos a vuestra sacra majestad; y jamás salieron ellos ni otra persona.

Visto que no salían, hice quitar los vestidos de aquellos que venían a hacerme el requerimiento y se los vistiesen otros españoles de los de mi compañía, los cuales hice ir a la playa y que llamasen a los de los navíos. Y visto por ellos, salió a tierra una barca con hasta diez o doce hombres con ballestas y escopetas, y los españoles que llamaban de la tierra se apartaron de la playa a unas matas que estaban cerca, como que se iban a la sombra de ellas; y así saltaron cuatro, los dos baile teros y los dos escopeteros, los cuales como estaban cercados de gente que yo tenía en la playa puesta, fueron tomados. Y el uno ellos era maestre de la una nao, el cual puso fuego a una escope matara aquel capitán que yo tenía en la Vera Cruz, sino que q Nuestro Señor que la mecha no tenía fuego.

Los que quedaron en la barca se hicieron a la mar, y antes que gasen a los navíos ya iban a la vela sin aguardar ni querer que de e se supiese cosa alguna, y de los que conmigo quedaron me informé cómo habían llegado a un río que está treinta leguas la costa a después de pasada Almería, y que allí habían habido buen acogimiento de los naturales, y que por rescate les habían dado de comer y que habían visto algún oro que traían los indios, aunque poco, y habían rescatado hasta tres mil castellanos de oro y que no habían saltado en tierra, más de que habían visto ciertos pueblos en la ribera del río tan cerca, que de los navíos los podían bien ver.

Y que no había edificios de piedra sino que todas las casas eran de paja, excepto que los suelos de ellas tenían algo altos y hechos de mano; lo cual todo después supe más por entero de aquel gran señor Mutezuma, y de ciertas lenguas de aquella tierra que él tenía consigo, a las cuales y a un indio que en los dichos navíos traían del dicho río, que también yo les tomé, envié con otros mensajeros del dicho Mutezuma para que hablasen al señor de aquel río que se dice Pánuco, para le atraer al servicio de vuestra sacra majestad. Y él me envió con ellos una persona principal y aun, según decía, señor de un pueblo, el cual me dio de su parte cierta ropa y piedras y plumajes, y me dijo que él y toda su tierra están muy contentos de ser vasallos de vuestra majestad y mis amigos.

Yo les di otras cosas de las de España, con que fue muy contento, y tanto que cuando los vieron otros navíos del dicho Francisco de Garay, de que adelante a vuestra alteza haré relación, me envió a decir el dicho Pánuco cómo los dichos navíos estaban en otro río, lejos de allí hasta cinco o seis jornadas, y que les hiciese saber si eran de mi naturaleza los que en ellos venían, porque les darían lo que hubiesen menester, y que les habían llevado ciertas mujeres y gallinas y otras cosas de comer.
Yo fuí, muy poderoso Señor, por la tierra y señorío de Cempoal, tres jornadas donde de todos los naturales fui muy bien recibido y hospedado; y a la cuarta jornada entré en una provincia que se llama Sienchimalen, en que hay en ella una villa muy fuerte y puesta en recio lugar, porque está en una ladera una sierra muy agra, y para la entrada no hay sino un paso de escalera, que es imposible pasar sino gente de pie, y aun con harta dificultad si los naturales quieren defender el paso.

En lo llano hay muchas aldeas y alquerías de a quinientos y a trescientos y doscientos labradores, que serán por todos hasta cinco o seis mil hombres de guerra, y esto es del señorío de aquel Mutezuma. Y aquí me recibieron muy bien y me dieron muy cumplidamente los bastimentos necesarios para mi camino, y me dijeron que bien sabían que yo iba a ver a Mutezuma su señor, y que fuese cierto que él era mi amigo y les había enviado a mandar que en todo caso me hiciesen muy buen acogimiento, porque en ello les servirían; y yo les satisfice a su buen comedimiento diciendo que vuestra majestad tenía noticia de él y me habían mandado que le viese, y que yo no iba a más de verle. Así pasé un puerto que está al fin de esta provincia, al que pusimos de nombre el puerto de Nombre de Dios, por ser el primero que en estas tierras habíamos pasado, el cual es tan agro y alto que no lo hay en España otro tan dificultoso de pasar, el cual pasé seguramente y sin contradicción alguna; y a la bajada del dicho puerto están otras al querías de una villa y fortaleza que se dice Ceyxnacan, que así mismo era del dicho Mutezuma, que no menos que de los de Sienchimalen fuimos bien recibidos y nos dijeron de la voluntad de Mutezuma lo que los otros nos habían dicho, y yo así mismo los satisfice.

Desde aquí anduve tres jornadas de despoblado y tierra inhabitable a causa de su esterilidad y falta de agua y muy grande frialdad que en ella hay, donde Dios sabe cuanto trabajó la gente, padeció de sed y de hambre, en especial de un turbión de piedra y agua que nos tomó en el dicho despoblado, de que pensé que perecería mucha gente de frío, y así murieron ciertos indios de la isla Fernandina, que iban mal arropados.

Al cabo de estas tres jornadas pasamos otro puerto, aunque no tan agro como el primero, y en lo alto de él estaba una torre pequeña casi como humilladero, donde tenían ciertos ídolos, y alderredor de la torre más de mil carretas de leña cortada, muy dispuesta a cuyo respecto le pusimos nombre el Puerto de la Leña; y a la bajada del dicho puerto entre unas tierras muy agras, está un valle muy poblado de gente que, según pareció, debían ser gente pobre. Después de haber andado dos leguas por la población sin saber de ella, llegué a un asiento algo más llano, donde pareció estar el señor de aquel valle, que tenía las mejores y mas bien labradas casas que hasta entonces en esta tierra habíamos visto, porque era todas de cantería labradas y muy nuevas, y había en ellas muchas y muy grandes y hermosas salas y muchos aposentos muy bien obrados. Este valle y población se llama Caltanmí. Del señor y gente fui muy bien recibido y aposentado.

Después de haberle hablado de parte de vuestra majestad y le haber dicho la causa de mi venida a estas partes, le pregunté si él era vasallo de Mutezuma o si era de otra parcialidad alguna, el cual, casi admirado de lo que le preguntaba, me respondió diciendo que quién no era vasallo de Mutezuma, queriendo decir que allí era señor del mundo. Yo le torné aquí a decir y replicar el gran poder de vuestra majestad, y otros muy muchos y muy mayores señores, que no Mutezuma, eran vasallos de vuestra alteza, y aun que no lo tenían en pequeña merced, y que así lo había de ser Mutezuma y todos los naturales de estas tierras, y que así lo requería a él que lo fuese, porque siéndolo, sería muy honrado y favorecido, y por el contrario, no queriendo obedecer, sería punido.

Y para que tuviese por bien de le mandar recibir a su real servicio, que le rogaba que me diese algún oro que yo enviase a vuestra majestad, y él me respondió que oro, que él lo tenía, pero que no me lo quería dar si Mutezuma no se lo mandase, y que mandándolo él, que el oro y su persona y cuanto tuviese daría. Por no escandalizarle ni dar algún desmán a mi propósito y camino, disimulé con él lo mejor que pude y le dije que muy presto le enviaría a mandar Mutezuma que diese el oro y lo demás que tuviese.

Aquí me vinieron a ver otros dos señores que en aquel valle tenían su tierra, el uno cuatro leguas valle abajo y el otro dos leguas arriba, y me dieron ciertos collarejos de oro de poco peso y valor y siete u ocho esclavas; y dejándolos así muy contentos, me partí después de haber estado allí cuatro o cinco días, y me pasé al asiento del otro señor que está casi dos leguas que dije, el valle arriba, que se dice Istacmastitán. El señorío de éste serán tres o cuatro leguas de población, sin salir casa de casa, por lo llano de un valle, ribera de un río pequeño que va por él, y en un cerro muy alto está la casa del señor con la mejor fortaleza que hay en la mitad de España, y mejor cercada de muro y barbacanes y cavas.

Y en lo alto de este cerro tendrá una población de hasta cinco o seis mil vecinos, de muy buenas casas y gente algo más rica que no la del valle abajo. Aquí mismo fuí muy bien recibido, y también me dijo este señor que era vasallo de Mutezuma, y estuve en este asiento tres días, así por me reparar de los trabajos que en el despoblado la gente pasó, como por esperar cuatro mensajeros de los naturales de Cempoal que venían conmigo, que yo desde Catalmi había enviado a una provincia muy grande que se llama Tascalteca, que me dijeron que estaba muy cerca de allí, como de verdad pareció; y me habían dicho que los naturales de esta provincia eran sus amigos de ellos y muy capitanes enemigos de Mutezuma, y que me querían confederar con ellos porque eran muchos y muy fuerte gente; y que confinaba su tierra por todas partes con la del dicho Mutezuma, y que tenían con él muy continuas guerras y que creía se holgar la conmigo y me favorecerían si el dicho Mutezuma se quisiese poner en algo conmigo''.

Los cuales dichos mensajeros en todo el tiempo que estuve en el dicho valle, que fueron por todos ocho días, no vinieron; y yo pregunté a aquellos principales de Cempoal que iban conmigo, que cómo no venían los dichos mensajeros, y me dijeron que debía de ser lejos y que no podrían venir tan aína. Y yo, viendo que se dilataba su venida y que aquellos principales de Cempoal me certificaban tanto la amistad y seguridad de los de esta provincia, me partí para allá.

Y a la salida del dicho valle hallé una gran cerca de piedra seca, tan alta como estado y medio, que atravesaba todo el valle de la una sierra a la otra, y tan ancha como veinte pies, y por toda ella un pretil de pie y medio de ancho para pelear desde encima y no más de una entrada, tan ancha como diez pasos; y en esta entrada doblada la una cerca sobre la otra a manera de rebellín, tan estrecho como cuarenta pasos, de manera que la entrada fuese a vueltas y no a derechas. Preguntada la causa de aquella cerca, me dijeron que la tenía porque eran fronteros de aquella provincia de Tascalteca, que eran enemigos de Mutezuma y tenían siempre guerra con ellos. Los naturales de este valle me rogaron que pues que iba a ver a Mutezuma su señor, que no pasase por la tierra de estos sus enemigos porque por ventura serían malos y me harían algún daño, que ellos me llevarían siempre por tierra del dicho Mutezuma sin salir de ella, y que en ella sería siempre bien recibido. Y los de Cempoal me decían que no lo hiciese, sino que fuese por allí; que lo que aquéllos me decían era por me apartar de la amistad de aquella provincia, y que eran malos traidores todos los de Mutezuma y que me llevarían a meter donde no pudiese salir.

Y porque yo de los de Cempoal tenía más concepto que de los otros, tomé su consejo, que fue seguir el camino de Tascalteca llevando a mi gente al mejor recado que yo podía, y yo con hasta seis de caballo iba adelante bien media legua y más, no con pensamiento de lo que después se me ofreció, pero por descubrir la tierra, para que si algo hubiese, y lo supiese y tuviese lugar de encontrar y apercibir la gente.

Y después de haber andado cuatro leguas, encumbrando un cerro, dos de caballo que iban delante de mí, vieron ciertos indios con sus plumajes que acostumbran traer en las guerras, y con sus espadas y rodelas, los cuales indios como vieron los de caballo, comenzaron a huir. A la sazón llegaba yo e hice que los llamasen y que viniesen y no hubiesen miedo; y fui más hacia donde estaban, que sería hasta quince indios, y ellos se juntaron y comenzaron a tirar cuchilladas y a dar voces a la otra su gente que estaba en un valle, y pelearon con nosotros de tal manera, que nos mataron dos caballos e hirieron otros tres y a dos de caballo.

Y en esto salió la otra gente, que sería hasta cuatro o cinco mil indios, y ya se habían llegado conmigo hasta ocho de caballo sin los otros muertos, y peleamos con ellos haciendo algunas arremetidas hasta esperar los españoles que con uno de caballo habían enviado a decir que anduviesen. Y en las vueltas les hicimos algún daño en que mataríamos cincuenta o sesenta de ellos sin que daño alguno recibiésemos, puesto que peleaban con mucho denuedo y ánimo; pero como todos éramos de caballo, arremetíamos a nuestro salvo y salimos así mismo.
Y desde que supieron que los nuestros se acercaban, se retrajeron porque eran pocos y nos dejaron el campo. Y después de haberse ido

vinieron ciertos mensajeros que dijeron ser de los señores de la dicha provincia y con ellos dos de los mensajeros que yo había enviado, los cuales dijeron que los dichos señores no sabían nada de lo que aquéllos habían hecho, que eran comunidades y sin su licencia lo habían hecho y que a ellos les pesaba, que me pagarían los caballos que me habían matado, que querían ser mis amigos y que fuera en hora buena, que sería bien recibido. Yo les respondí que lo agradecía, que los tenía por amigos y que yo iría como ellos decían. Aquella noche me fue forzado dormir en un arroyo, una legua adelante donde esto acaeció, así por ser tarde como porque la gente venía cansada.

Allí estuve al mejor recaudo que pude con mis velas y escuchas, así de caballo como de pie, hasta que fue el día, que partí llevando mi delantera y recuaje bien concertadas y mis corredores delante. Y llegando a un pueblo pequeñuelo, ya que salía el sol, vinieron los otros dos mensajeros llorando, diciendo que los habían atado para matarlos y que ellos se habían escapado aquella noche.

Y no dos tiros de piedra de ellos, asomó mucha cantidad de indios muy armados y con ' gran grita y comenzaron a pelear con nosotros tirándonos muchas va ras y flechas y yo les comencé a hacer mis requerimientos en focon las lenguas que conmigo llevaba, por ante escribano. Y cuan más me paraba a amonestarlos y requerir con la paz, tanto más prisa nos daban, ofendiéndonos cuanto ellos podían y viendo que aprovechaban requerimientos ni protestaciones, comenzamos a defendernos como podíamos y así nos llevaron peleando hasta meternos entre más de cien mil hombres de pelea que por todas partes tenían cercados y pelearnos con ellos y ellos con nosotros, todo el hasta una hora antes de puesto el sol, que se retrajeron, en que media docena de tiros de fuego, con cinco o seis escopetas, cuarta ballesteros y con los trece de caballo que me quedaron, les hice mucho daño sin recibir de ellos ninguno, más del trabajo, cansan de pelear y el hambre. Bien pareció que Dios fue el que por nosotros peleó, pues entre tanta multitud de gente tan animosa y diestra pelear y con tantos géneros de armas para ofendernos, salimos tan libres.

Aquella noche me hice fuerte en una torrecilla de sus ídolos, que estaba en un cerrito y luego, siendo de día, dejé en el real dosciento s hombres y toda la artillería. Y por ser yo el que acometía salí a ellos con los de caballos y cien peones y cuatrocientos indios de los que traje de Cempoal y trescientos de Iztamestitan.

Y antes que hubiese lugar de juntarse, les quemé cinco o seis lugares pequeños de hasta cien vecinos y traje cerca de cuatrocientas personas, entre hombres y mujeres, presos y me cogí al real peleando con ellos sin que daño ninguno me hiciesen. Otro día en amaneciendo, dan sobre nuestro real más de ciento cuarenta y nueve mil hombres que cubrían toda la tierra, tan determinadamente, que algunos de ellos entraron dentro de él y anduvieron a cuchilladas con los españoles y salimos a ellos y quiso Nuestro Señor en tal manera ayudarnos, que en obra de cuatro horas habíamos hecho lugar paz que en nuestro real no nos ofendiesen puesto que todavía hacían algunas arremetidas. Y así estuvimos peleando hasta que fue tarde, que se retrajeron.

Otro día torné a salir por otra parte antes que fuese de día, sin ser sentido de ellos, con los de caballo, cien peones y los indios mis amigos y les quemé más de diez pueblos, en que hubo pueblo de ellos de más de tres mil casas y allí pelearon conmigo los del pueblo, que otra gente no debía de estar allí. Y como traíamos la bandera de la cruz y pugnábamos por nuestra fe y por servicio de vuestra sacra majestad en su muy real ventura, nos dio Dios tanta victoria que les matamos mucha gente, sin que los nuestros recibiesen daño. Y poco más de mediodía, ya que la fuerza de la gente se juntaba de todas partes, estábamos en nuestro real con la victoria habida.

Otro día siguiente vinieron mensajeros de los señores diciendo que ellos querían ser vasallos de vuestra alteza y mis amigos y que me rogaban les perdonase el yerro pasado. Yo les respondí que ellos habían hecho mal, pero que yo era contento de ser su amigo y perdonarles lo que habían hecho. Otro día siguiente vinieron hasta cincuenta indios que, según pareció, eran hombres de quien se hacía caso entre ellos, diciendo que nos venían a traer de comer y comienzan a mirar las entradas y salidas del real y algunas chozuelas donde estábamos a posentados.

Y los de Cempoal vinieron a mi y dijéronme que mirase que aquellos eran malos y que venían a espiar y mirar cómo nos podrían dañar y que tuviese por cierto que no venían a otra cosa. Yo hice tomar uno de ellos disimuladamente, que los otros no lo vieron y me aparté con él y con las lenguas y le amedrenté para que me dijese la verdad, el cual confesó que Sintengal, que es el capitán general de esta provincia, estaba detrás de unos cerros que estaban fronteros del real, con mucha cantidad de gente para dar aquella noche sobre nosotros, porque decían que ya se habían probado de día con nosotros, que no les aprovechaba nada y que querían probar de noche porque los suyos no temiesen los caballos ni los tiros ni las espadas y que los habían enviado a ellos para que viesen nuestro real y laso: partes por donde nos podían entrar y cómo nos podrían quemar aquellas chozas de paja. Luego hice tomar otro de los dichos indios y le pregunté asimismo y confesó lo que el otro por las mismas palabras. Y de éstos tomé cinco o seis, que todos confirmaron en sus dichos. Y visto, los mandé tomar a todos cincuenta y cortarles las manos y los envié que dijesen a su señor que de noche y de día y cada cuando él viniese, verían quién éramos.

Hice yo fortalecer mi real a lo mejor que pude y poner la gente en las estancias que me pareció que convenían y así estuve sobre aviso, hasta que se puso el sol y ya que anochecía comenzó a bajar la ge te de los contrarios por dos valles y ellos pensaban que venían secretos para cercarnos y ponerse más cerca de nosotros para ejecutar propósito y como yo estaba tan avisado, los vi y me pareció que dejarlos llegar al real, que sería mucho daño, porque de noche como viesen lo que de mi parte se les hiciese, llegarían más sin temor y esta bien porque los españoles no viéndolos, algunos tendrían alguna flaqueza en el pelear y temí que me pusieran fuego, lo cual si acaeciera fuera tanto daño que ninguno de nosotros escapara y determiné de salirles al encuentro con toda la gente de caballo para espanta o desbaratar en manera que ellos no llegasen y así fue que, como n sintieron que íbamos con los caballos a dar sobre ellos sin ningún tener ni grita se metieron por los maizales, de que toda la tierra taba casi llena y aliviaron algunos de los mantenimientos que traían para estar sobre nosotros, si de aquella vez del todo nos pudiesen arrancar y así se fueron por aquella noche y quedamos seguros. Después de pasado esto, estuve ciertos días que no salí de nuestro real más del redor para defender la entrada de algunos indios que nos venían a gritar y hacer algunas escaramuzas.

Y después de estar algo descansados, salí una noche después de rondada la guarda de la prima, con cien peones, con los indios nuestros amigos y con los de caballo. Y a una legua del real se me cayeron cinco de los caballos y yeguas que llevaba, que en ninguna manera los pude pasar adelante y los hice volver. Y aunque todos los de mi compañía decían que me tornase porque era mala señal, todavía seguí mi camino considerando que Dios es sobre natura y antes que amaneciese di sobre dos pueblos, en que maté mucha gente y no quise quemar las casas por no ser sentido con los fuegos de las otras poblaciones que estaban muy juntas. Y ya que amanecía di en otro pueblo tan grande, que se ha hallado en él, por visitación que yo hice hacer, más de veinte mil casas.

Y como los tomé de sobresalto, salían desarmados y las mujeres y niños desnudos por las calles y comencé a hacerles algún daño y viendo que no tenían resistencia vinieron a mí ciertos principales del dicho pueblo a rogarme que no les hiciésemos más mal porque ellos querían ser vasallos de vuestra alteza y mis amigos y que bien veían que ellos tenían la culpa en no haberme querido servir, pero que de allí en adelante yo verla como ellos harían lo que yo en nombre de vuestra majestad les mandase y que serían muy verdaderos vasallos suyos. Y luego vinieron conmigo más de cuatro mil de ellos de paz y me sacaron fuera a una fuente, muy bien de comer y así los dejé pacíficos y volví a nuestro real donde hallé la gente que en él había dejado harto atemorizada creyendo que se me hubiera ofrecido algún peligro, por lo que la noche antes habían visto en volver los caballos y yeguas.

Después de sabida la victoria que Dios nos había querido dar y cómo dejaba aquellos pueblos de paz, hubieron mucho placer, porque certifico a vuestra majestad que no había tal de nosotros que no tuviese mucho temor por vernos tan dentro en la tierra y entre tanta y tal gente y tan sin esperanzas de socorro de ninguna parte, de tal manera que ya a mis oídos oía decir por los corrillos y casi público, que había sido Pedro Carbonero que los había metido donde nunca podrían salir y aún más oí decir en una choza de ciertos compañeros estando donde ellos no me veían, que si yo era loco y me metía donde nunca podría salir, que no lo fuesen ellos, sino que se volviesen a la mar y que si yo quisiese volver con ellos, bien y si no, que me dejasen. Muchas veces fui de esto por muchas veces requerido y yo los animaba diciéndoles que mirasen que eran vasallos de vuestra alteza Y que jamás en los españoles en ninguna parte hubo falta y que estábamos en disposición de ganar para vuestra majestad los mayores reinos y señoríos que había en el mundo y que demás de hacer lo que como cristianos éramos obligados, en pugnar contra los enemigos de nuestra fe y por ello en el otro mundo ganábamos la gloria y en éste conseguíamos el mayor prez y honra que hasta nuestros tiempos ninguna generación gano. Y que mirasen que teníamos a Dios de nuestra parte y que a él ninguna cosa le es imposible y que lo viesen por las victorias que habíamos habido, donde tanta gente de los enemigos habían muerto y de los nuestros ningunos; y les dije otras cosas que me pareció decirles de esta calidad, que con ellas y con el real favor de vuestra alteza cobraron mucho ánimo y los atraje a mi propósito y a hacer lo que yo deseaba, que era dar fin a mi demanda comenzada.

Otro día siguiente, a hora de las diez, vino a mí Sicutengal, el capitán general de esta provincia, con hasta cincuenta personas principales de ella y me rogó de su parte y de la de Magiscasin, que es la más principal persona de toda la provincia y de otros muchos seño res de ella, que yo les quisiese admitir al real servicio de vuestra alteza y a mi amistad y les perdonase los yerros pasados, porque ello no nos conocían ni sabían quién éramos y que ya habían probado todas sus fuerzas, así de día como de noche, para excusarse a ser súbditos ni sujetos a nadie, porque en ningún tiempo esta provincia lo había sido ni tenían ni habían tenido cierto señor; antes habían venido exentos y por sí, de inmemorial tiempo acá y que siempre se habían defendido contra el gran poder de Mutezuma y de su padre y abuelos, que toda la tierra tenían sojuzgada y a ellos jamás habían podido traer a sujeción, teniéndolos como los tenían cercados por todas partes sin tener lugar para por ninguna de su tierra poder salir que no comían sal porque no la había en su tierra ni se la dejaban salir a comprar a otras partes, ni vestían ropas de algodón porque su tierra por la frialdad no se criaba y otras muchas cosas de que carecían por estar así encerrados.

Y que todo lo sufrían y habían por bueno por ser exentos y no sujetos a nadie y que conmigo que quisieran hacer lo mismo y para ello; como ya decían, habían probado sus fuerzas y que veían claro que ni ellas ni las mañas que habían podido tener les aprovechaban, que querían antes ser vasallos de vuestra alteza que no morir y ser destruida: sus casas y mujeres e hijos.

Yo les satisfice diciendo que conociesen cómo ellos tenían la culpa del daño que habían recibido y que yo me venía a su tierra creyendo que venía a tierra de mis amigos, porque los de Cempoal así me lo habían certificado que lo eran y querían ser y que yo les había enviado mis mensajeros delante para hacerles saber como venia y la voluntad que de su amistad traía y que sin responderme, viniendo yo seguro, me habían salido a saltear en el camino y me habían matado dos caballos y herido otros. Y demás de esto, después de haber peleado conmigo, me enviaron sus mensajeros diciendo que aquello que se había hecho había sido sin ser licencia y consentimiento y que ciertas comunidades se habían movido a ello sin darles parte; pero que ellos se lo habían reprendido y que querían mi amistad.

Y yo creyendo ser así les había dicho que me placía y me vendría otro día seguramente en sus casas como en casas de amigos y que así mismo me habían salido al camino y peleado conmigo todo el día hasta que la noche sobrevino, no obstante que para mí habían sido requeridos con la paz. Y trájeles a la memoria todo lo demás que contra mí habían hecho y otras muchas cosas que por no dar a vuestra alteza importunidad dejo. Finalmente, que ellos quedaron y se ofrecieron por súbditos y vasallos de vuestra majestad y para su real servicio, ofrecieron sus personas y haciendas y así lo hicieron y han hecho hasta hoy y creo lo harán siempre por lo que adelante vuestra majestad verá.

Y así estuve sin salir de aquel aposento y real que allí tenía seis o siete días, porque no me osaba fiar de ellos puesto que me rogaban que me viniese a una ciudad grande que tenían donde todos los señores de su provincia residían y residen, hasta tanto que todos los señores me vinieron a rogar que me fuese a la ciudad, porque allí sería mejor recibido y provisto de las cosas necesarias, que no en el campo y porque ellos tenían vergüenza en que yo estuviese tan mal aposentado, pues me tenían por su amigo y ellos y yo éramos vasallos de vuestra alteza y por su ruego me vine a la ciudad que está seis leguas del aposento y real que yo tenía

La cual ciudad es tan grande y de tanta admiración que aunque mucho de lo que de ella podría decir dejé, lo poco que diré creo que es casi increíble, porque es muy mayor que Granada y muy más fuerte y de tan buenos edificios y de mucha más gente que Granada tema al tiempo que se ganó y muy mejor abastecida de las cosas de la tierra, que es de pan, de aves, caza, pescado de ríos y de otras legumbres y cosas que ellos comen muy buenas. Hay en esta ciudad un mercado en que casi cotidianamente todos los días hay en él de treinta mil ánimas arriba, vendiendo y comprando, sin otros muchos mercadillos que hay por la ciudad en partes. En este mercado hay todas cuantas cosas, así de mantenimiento como de vestido y calzado, que ellos tratan y puede haber.

Hay joyerías de oro, plata, piedras y otras joyas de plumaje, tan bien concertado como puede ser en todas las plazas y mercados del mundo. Hay mucha loza de muchas maneras y muy buena y tal como la mejor de España. Venden mucha leña, carbón e hierbas de comer y medicinales. Hay casas donde lavan las cabezas como barberos y las rapan; hay baños. Finalmente, que entre ellos hay toda manera de buena orden y policía y es gente de toda razón y concierto, tal que lo mejor de áfrica no se le iguala"".

Es esta provincia de muchos valles llanos y hermosos y todos labrados y sembrados sin haber en ella cosa vacua; tiene en torno la provincia noventa leguas y más. El orden que hasta ahora se ha alcanzado que la gente de ella tiene en gobernarse, es casi como las señorías de Venecia y Génova o Pisa, porque no hay señor general de todos. Hay muchos señores y todos residen en esta ciudad y los pueblos de la tierra son labradores y son vasallos de estos señores y cada uno tiene su tierra por sí; tienen unos mas que otros y para sus guerras que han de ordenar júntanse todos y todos juntos las ordenan y conciertan.

Créese que deben de tener alguna manera de justicia para castigar los malos, porque uno de los naturales de esta provincia hurtó cierto oro a un español y yo lo dije a aquel Magiscasin, que es el mayor señor de todos e hicieron su pesquisa y siguiéronlo hasta una ciudad que está cerca de allí, que se dice Churultecal y de allí lo trajeron preso y me lo entregaron con el oro y me dijeron que yo lo hiciese castigar; yo les agradecí la diligencia que en ello pusieron y les dije que, pues estaba en su tierra, que ellos le castigasen como lo acostumbraban y que yo no me quería entremeter en castigar a los suyos estando en su tierra, de lo cual me dieron gracias y lo tomaron y con pregón público que manifiesta su delito, le hicieron llevar por aquel grande mercado y allí le pusieron al pie de uno como teatro que está en medio del dicho mercado y encima del teatro subió el pregonero y en altas voces tornó a decir el delito de aquél; y viéndolos todos, le dieron con unas porras en la cabeza hasta que lo mataron. Y muchos otros hemos visto en prisiones que dicen que les tienen por hurtos y cosas que han hecho. Hay en esta provincia por visitación que yo en ella mandé hacer, ciento cincuenta mil vecinos, con otra provincia pequeña que está junto con ésta que se dice Guasincango, que viven a la manera de éstos sin señor natural, los cuales no menos están por vasallos de vuestra alteza que estos tascalteca.

Estando, muy católico señor, en aquel real que tenía en el campo cuando en la guerra de esta provincia estaba, vinieron a mi seis señores muy principales vasallos de Mutezuma, con hasta doscientos hombres para su servicio y me dijeron que venían de parte del dicho Mutezuma a decirme cómo él quería ser vasallo de vuestra alteza y mi amigo y que viese yo qué era lo que quería que él diese por vuestra alteza en cada año de tributo, así de oro como de plata, piedras, esclavos, ropa de algodón y otras cosas de las que él tenía y que todo lo daría con tanto que yo no fuese a su tierra y que lo hacía porque era muy estéril y falta de todos mantenimientos y que le pesaría de que yo padeciese necesidad y los que conmigo venían y con ellos me envió hasta mil pesos de oro y otras tantas piezas de ropa de algodón de la que ellos visten.

Y estuvieron conmigo en mucha parte de la guerra hasta el fin de ella, que vieron bien lo que los españoles podían y las paces que con los de esta provincia se hicieron y el ofrecimiento que al servicio de vuestra sacra majestad los señores y toda la tierra hicieron, de que según pareció y ellos mostraban, no hubieron mucho placer, porque trabajaron muchas vías y formas de revolverme con ellos, diciendo cómo no era cierto lo que me decían, ni verdadera la amistad que afirmaban y que lo hacían por mi asegurar para hacer a su salvo alguna traición.

Los de esta provincia, por consiguiente, me decían y avisaban muchas veces que no me fiase de aquellos vasallos de Motezuma porque eran traidores y sus cosas siempre las hacían a traición y con mañas y con éstas habían sojuzgado toda la tierra y que me avisaban de ello como verdaderos amigos y como personas que los conocían de mucho tiempo acá.

Vista la discordia y disconformidad de los unos y de los otros, no hube poco placer, porque me pareció hacer mucho a mi propósito y que podría tener manera de más aína sojuzgarlos y que me dijese aquel común decir de monte, etc. y aún me acordé de una autoridad evangélica que dice: Omne regnum in se ipsum divisum desolabitur , y con los unos y con los otros maneaba y a cada uno en secreto le agradecía el aviso que me daba y le daba crédito de más amistad que al otro.

Después de haber estado en esta ciudad veinte días y más, me dijeron aquellos señores mensajeros de Mutezuma que siempre estuvieron conmigo, que me fuese a una ciudad que está a seis leguas de esta de Tascaltecal, que se dice Churultecal, porque los naturales de ella eran amigos de Mutezuma su señor y que allí sabríamos la voluntad del dicho Mutezuma, si era que yo fuese a su tierra y que algunos de ellos irían a hablar con él y a decirle lo que yo les había dicho. Y me volverían con la respuesta y aunque sabían que allí estaban algunos mensajeros suyos para hablarme, yo les dije que me iría y que partiría para un día cierto que les señalase.

Y sabido por los de esta provincia de Tlascaltecal lo que aquéllos habían concertado conmigo y cómo yo había aceptado de irme con ellos a aquella ciudad, vinieron a mí con mucha pena los señores y me dijeron que en ninguna manera fuese porque me tenían ordenada cierta traición para matarme en aquella ciudad a mí y a los de mi compañía y que para ello había enviado Mutezuma de su tierra, porque alguna parte de 1 ella confina con esta ciudad, cincuenta mil hombres y que los tenía en guarnición a dos leguas de la dicha ciudad, según señalaron y que tenían cerrado el camino real por donde solían ir y hecho otro nuevo de muchos hoyos y palos agudos hincados y encubiertos para que los caballos cayesen y se mancasen y que tenía muchas de las calles tapiadas y por las azoteas de las casas muchas piedras para que después que entrásemos en la ciudad tomarnos seguramente y aprovecharse de nosotros a su voluntad y que si yo quería ver cómo era verdad lo que ellos me decían, que mirase cómo los señores de aquella ciudad nunca habían venido a verme ni hablar estando tan cerca de ésta, pues habían venido los de Guasincango, que estaban más lejos que ellos y que los enviase a llamar y vería cómo no querían venir.

Yo les agradecí su aviso y les rogué que me diesen ellos personas que de mi parte los fuesen a llamar y así me los dieron y yo les envié a rogar que viniesen a verme porque les quería hablar ciertas cosas de Parte de vuestra alteza y decirles la causa de mi venida a esta tierra.

Los cuales mensajeros fueron y dijeron mi mensaje a los señores de la dicha ciudad y con ellos vinieron dos o tres personas, no de mucha autoridad y me dijeron que ellos venían de parte de aquellos señores porque ellos no podían venir por estar enfermos, que a ellos les dijese lo que quería. Los de esta ciudad me dijeron que era burla y que aquellos mensajeros eran hombres de poca calidad y que en ninguna manera me partiese sin que los señores de la ciudad viniesen aquí.

Yo les hablé a aquellos mensajeros y les dije que embajada de tan alto príncipe como vuestra sacra majestad, que no se debía de dar a tales personas como ellos y que aun sus señores eran poco para oírla; por tanto, que dentro de tres días pareciesen ante mía dar la obediencia a vuestra alteza y a ofrecerse por sus vasallos, con apercibimiento que pasado el término que les daba, si no viniesen, iría sobre ellos y los destruiría y procedería contra ellos como contra personas rebeldes y que no se querían someter debajo del dominio de vuestra alteza.

Y para ello les envié un mandamiento firmado de mi nombre y de un escribano con relación larga de la real persona de vuestra sacra majestad y de mi venida, diciéndoles cómo todas estas partes y otras muy mayotes tierras y señoríos eran de vuestra alteza y que los que quisiesen ser sus vasallos serían honrados y favorecidos y por el contrario, los que fuesen rebeldes, serían castigados conforme a justicia.

Y otro día vinieron algunos de los señores de la dicha ciudad o casi todos y me dijeron que si ellos no habían venido antes, la causa era porque los de esta provincia eran sus enemigos y que no osaban entrar por su tierra porque no pensaban venir seguros y que bien creían que me habían dicho algunas cosas de ellos; que no les diese crédito porque las decían como enemigos y no porque pasara así y que me fuese a su ciudad y que allí conocería ser falsedad lo que éstos me

decían y la verdad lo que ellos me certificaban, que desde entonces se daban y ofrecían por vasallos de vuestra sacra majestad y que lo serían para siempre y servían y contribuían en todas las cosas, que de parte de vuestra alteza se les mandase y así lo asentó un escribano, por las lenguas que yo tenía.

Y todavía determiné de irme con ellos, así por no mostrar flaqueza, como porque desde allí pensaba hacer mis negocios con Moctezuma, porque confina con su tierra, como ya he dicho y allí usaban venir y los de allí ir allá, porque en el camino no tenían requesta alguna.

Y como los de Tascaltecal vieron mi determinación, pesóles mucho y dijéronme muchas veces que lo erraba. Pero, que pues ellos se habían dado por vasallos de vuestra sacra majestad y mis amigos, que querían ir conmigo a ayudarme en todo lo que se ofreciese. Y puesto que yo se lo defendiese y rogué que no fuesen porque no había necesidad, todavía me siguieron hasta cien mil hombres muy bien aderezados de guerra y llegaron conmigo hasta dos leguas de la ciudad y desde allí por mucha importunidad mía, se volvieron, aunque todavía quedaron en mi compañía hasta cinco o seis mil de ellos.

Dormí en un arroyo que allí estaba a las dos leguas, por despedir la gente porque no hiciesen algún escándalo en la ciudad y también porque era ya tarde y no quise entrar en la ciudad sobre tarde. Otro día de mañana salieron de la ciudad'' a recibirme al camino, con muchas trompetas y atabales y muchas personas de las que ellos tienen por religiosas en sus mezquitas, vestidas de las vestiduras que usan y cantando a su manera como lo hacen en las dichas mezquitas. Y con esta solemnidad nos llevaron hasta entrar en la ciudad y nos metieron en un aposento muy bueno a donde toda la gente de mi compañía se aposentó a mi placer.

Allí nos trajeron de comer, aunque no cumplidamente y en el camino topamos muchas señales de las que los naturales de esta provincia nos habían dicho, porque hallamos el camino real cerrado y hecho otro y algunos hoyos, aunque no muchos y algunas calles de la ciudad tapiadas y muchas piedras en todas las azoteas. Con esto nos hicieron estar más sobre aviso y a mayor recaudo.

Allí hallé ciertos mensajeros de Mutezuma que venían a hablar con los que conmigo estaban y a mí no me dijeron cosa alguna más de que venían a saber de aquéllos lo que conmigo habían hecho y concertado, para irlo a decir a su señor y así se fueron después de los haberles hablado ellos y aun el uno de los que antes conmigo estaban, que era el más principal. En tres días que allí estuve, proveyeron muy mal y cada día peor y muy pocas veces me venían a ver ni hablar los señores y personas principales de la ciudad. Y estando algo perplejo en esto, a la lengua que yo tengo, que es una india de esta tierra, que hube en Potonchán, que es el río grande que ya en la primera relación a vuestra majestad hice memoria, le dijo otra natural de esta ciudad cómo muy cerquita de allí estaba mucha gente de Mutezuma junta y que los de la ciudad tenían fuera sus mujeres e hijos y toda su ropa y que había de dar sobre nosotros para matarnos a todos y si ella se quería salvar que se fuese con ella, que ella la guarecería; la cual lo dijo a aquel Jerónimo de Aguilar, lengua que yo hube en Yucatán de que asimismo a vuestra alteza hube escrito y me lo hizo saber. Y yo tuve uno de los naturales de la dicha ciudad que por allí andaba y le aparté secretamente que nadie lo vio y le interrogué y confirmó todo lo que la india y los naturales de Tascaltecal me habían dicho.

Y así por esto como por las señales que para ello veía, acordé de prevenir antes de ser prevenido, e hice llamar a algunos de los señores de la ciudad diciendo que les quería hablar y les metí en una sala y en tanto hice que la gente de los nuestros estuviese apercibida y que en soltando una escopeta diesen en mucha cantidad de indios que había junto al aposento y muchos dentro de él. Así se hizo, que después que tuve los señores dentro de aquella sala, dejélos atando y cabalgué e hice soltar la escopeta y dímosles tal mano, que en pocas horas murieron más de tres mil hombres. Y porque vuestra majestad vea cuán apercibidos estaban, antes que yo saliese de nuestro aposento tenían todas las calles tomadas y toda la gente a punto, aunque como los tomamos de sobresalto fueron buenos de desbaratar, mayormente que les faltaban los caudillos porque los tenía ya presos e hice poner fuego a algunas torres y casas fuertes donde se defendían y nos ofendían y así anduve por la ciudad peleando, dejando a buen recaudo el aposento, que era muy fuerte, bien cinco horas, hasta que eché toda la gente fuera de la ciudad por muchas partes de ella, porque me ayudaban bien cinco mil indios de Tascaltecal y otros cuatrocientos de Cempoal.

Vuelto al aposento, hablé con aquellos señores que tenía presos y les pregunté qué era la causa que me querían matar a traición y me respondieron que ellos no tenían la culpa porque los de Culúa que son los vasallos de Mutezuma, los habían puesto en ello y que el dicho Mutezuma tenía allí en tal parte, que, según después pareció, sería legua y media, cincuenta mil hombres en guarnición para hacerlo, pero que ya conocían cómo habían sido engañados, que soltase uno o dos de ellos y que harían recoger la gente de la ciudad y tornar a ella todas las mujeres, niños y ropa que tenían fuera y que me rogaban que aquel yerro les perdonase, que ellos me certificaban que de allí adelante nadie les engañaría y serían muy ciertos y leales vasallos de vuestra alteza y mis amigos. Después de haberles hablado muchas cosas acerca de su yerro, solté dos de ellos y otro día siguiente estaba toda la ciudad poblada y llena de mujeres y niños muy seguros, como si cosa alguna de lo pasado no hubiera acaecido y luego solté todos los otros señores que tenía presos, con que me prometieron servir a vuestra majestad muy lealmente y en obra de quince o veinte días que allí estuve quedó la ciudad y tierra tan pacífica y tan poblada que parecía que nadie faltaba de ella, en sus mercados y tratos por la ciudad como antes lo solían tener e hice que los de esta ciudad de Churultecal y los de Tascaltecal fuesen amigos, porque lo solían ser antes y muy poco tiempo había que Mutezuma con dádivas los había seducido a su amistad y hechos enemigos de estos otros.

Esta ciudad de Churultecal está asentada en un llano y tiene hasta veinte mil casas dentro, en el cuerpo de la ciudad y tiene de arrabales otras tantas. Es señorío por sí y tiene sus términos conocidos; no obedece a señor ninguno, excepto que se gobiernan como estos otros de Tascaltecal. La gente de esta ciudad es más vestida que los de Tascaltecal, en alguna manera; porque los honrados ciudadanos de ellos todos traen albornoces encima de la otra ropa, aunque son diferenciados de los de áfrica porque tienen maneras; pero en la hechura, tela y los rapacejos son muy semejantes. Todos éstos han sido y son después de este trance pasado, muy ciertos vasallos de vuestra majestad y muy obedientes a lo que yo en su real nombre les he requerido y dicho y creo lo serán de aquí adelante. Esta ciudad es muy fértil de labranzas porque tiene mucha tierra y se riega la más parte de ella y aun es la ciudad más hermosa de fuera que hay en España, porque es muy torreada y llana y certifico a vuestra alteza que yo conté desde una mezquita cuatrocientas treinta tantas torres en la dicha ciudad y todas son de mezquitas. Es la ciudad más a propósito de vivir españoles que yo he visto de los puertos acá, porque tiene algunos baldíos y aguas para criar ganados, lo que no tienen ningunas de cuantas hemos visto, porque es tanta la multitud de la gente que en estas partes mora, que ni un palmo de tierra hay que no esté labrada y aun con todo en muchas partes padecen necesidad por falta de pan y aun hay mucha gente pobre y que piden entre los ricos por las calles y por las casas y mercados, como hacen los pobres en España y en otras partes que hay gente de razón.

A aquellos mensajeros de Mutezuma que conmigo estaban hablé acerca de aquella traición que en aquella ciudad se me quería hacer y cómo los señores de ella afirmaban que por consejo de Mutezuma se había hecho y que no me parecía que era hecho de tan gran señor enviarme sus mensajeros y personas tan honradas como me había enviado a decirme que era mi amigo y por otra parte buscar maneras de ofenderme con mano ajena, para salvarse él de culpa si no le sucediese como él pensaba. Y que pues así era, que él no me guardaba su palabra ni me decía verdad, que yo quería mudar mi propósito; que así como iba hasta entonces a su tierra con voluntad de verle, hablar, tener por amigo y tener con él mucha conversación y paz, que ahora quería entrar por su tierra de guerra, haciéndole todo el daño que pudiese como a enemigo y que me pesaba mucho de ello, porque más le quisiera siempre por amigo y tomar siempre su parecer en las cosas que en esta tierra hubiera de hacer.

Aquellos suyos me respondieron que ellos había muchos días que estaban conmigo y que no sabían nada de aquel concierto más de lo que allí en aquella ciudad después de aquello se ofreció supieron y que no podían creer que por consejo y mandado de Mutezuma se hiciese y que me rogaban que antes que me determinase a perder su amistad y hacerle la guerra que decía, me informase bien de la verdad y que diese licencia a uno de ellos para ir a hablarle, que él volvería muy presto. Hay de esta ciudad a donde Mutezuma residía, veinte leguas. Yo les dije que me placía y dejé ir al uno de ellos y dende a seis días volvió él y otro que primero se había ido y trajéronme diez platos de oro, mil quinientas piezas de ropa, mucha provisión de gallinas, pan y cacao, que es cierto brebaje que ellos beben y me dijeron que a Mutezuma le había pesado mucho de aquel desconcierto que en Churultecal se quería hacer, porque yo no creería ya sino que había sido por su consejo y mandado y que él me hacía cierto que no era así y que la gente que allí estaba en guarnición era verdad que era suya, pero que ellos se habían movido sin habérselo él mandado, por inducimiento de los de Churultecal, porque eran de dos provincias suyas que se llamaban la una Acancingo y la otra Yzcucan, que confina con la tierra de la dicha ciudad de Churultecal y que entre ellos conciertan alianzas de vecindad para ayudarse los unos a los otros Y que de esta manera habían venido allí y no por su mandado; pero que adelante yo vería en sus obras si era verdad lo que él me había enviado a decir o no y que todavía me rogaba que no curase de ir a su tierra porque era estéril y padeceríamos necesidad y que donde quiera que yo estuviese le enviase a pedir lo que yo quisiese y que lo enviaría muy cumplidamente.

Yo le respondí que la ida a su tierra no se podía excusar porque había de enviar de él y de ella relación a vuestra majestad y que yo creía lo que él me enviaba a decir; por tanto, que pues yo no había de dejar de llegar a verle, que él lo hubiese por bien y que no se pusiese en otra cosa porque sería mucho daño suyo y a mí me pesaría de cualquiera que le viniese. Y desde que ya vio que mi determinada voluntad era de verle a él y a su tierra, me envió a decir que fuese en hora buena, que él me hospedaría en aquella gran ciudad donde estaba y envióme muchos de los suyos para que fuesen conmigo porque ya entraba por su tierra, los cuales me querían encaminar por cierto camino donde ellos debían de tener algún concierto para ofendernos, según después pareció, porque lo vieron muchos españoles que yo enviaba después por la tierra. Había en aquel camino tantas puentes y pasos malos, que yendo por él, muy a su salvo pudieran ejecutar su propósito. Mas como Dios haya tenido siempre cuidado de encaminar las reales cosas de vuestra sacra majestad desde su niñez y como yo y los de mi compañía íbamos en su real servicio, nos mostró otro camino aunque algo agro, no tan peligroso corno aquel por donde nos querían llevar y fue de esta manera:

Que a ocho leguas de esta ciudad de Churultecal están dos sierras muy altas y muy maravillosas, porque en fin de agosto tienen tanta nieve que otra cosa de lo alto de ellas si no la nieve, se parece. Y de la una que es la más alta sale muchas veces, así de día como de noche, tan grande bulto de humo como una gran casa y sube encima de la sierra hasta las nubes, tan derecho como una vita, que, según parece, es tanta la fuerza con que sale que aunque arriba en la sierra andaba siempre muy recio el viento, no lo puede torcer. Y porque yo siempre he deseado de todas las cosas de esta tierra poder hacer a vuestra alteza muy particular relación, quise de ésta, que me pareció algo maravillosa, saber el secreto y envié a diez de mis compañeros, tales cuales para semejante negocio eran necesarios y con algunos naturales de la tierra que los guiasen y les encomendé mucho procurasen de subir la dicha sierra y saber el secreto de aquel humo, de dónde y cómo salía. Los cuales fueron y trabajaron lo que fue posible para subirla y jamás pudieron, a causa de la mucha nieve que en la sierra hay y de muchos torbellinos que de la ceniza que de allí sale andan por la sierra y también porque no pudieron sufrir la gran frialdad que arriba hacía, pero llegaron muy cerca de lo alto y tanto que estando arriba comenzó a salir aquel humo y dicen que salía con tanto ímpetu y ruido que parecía que toda la sierra se caía abajo y así se bajaron y trajeron mucha nieve y carámbanos para que los viésemos, porque nos parecía cosa muy nueva en estas partes a causa de estar en parte tan cálida, según hasta ahora ha sido opinión de los pilotos, especialmente, que dicen que esta tierra está en veinte grados, que es en el paralelo de la isla Española, donde continuamente hace muy gran calor. Y yendo a ver esta sierra, toparon un camino y preguntaron a los naturales de la tierra que iban con ellos, que para donde iba y dijeron que a Culúa y que aquél era buen camino y que el otro por donde nos querían llevar los de Culúa no era bueno y los españoles fueron por él hasta encumbrar las sierras, por medio de las cuales entre la una y la otra va el camino y descubrieron los llanos de Culúa y la gran ciudad de Temixtitan y las lagunas que hay en la dicha provincia, de que adelante haré relación a vuestra alteza y vinieron muy alegres por haber descubierto tan buen camino y Dios sabe cuánto holgué yo de ello.

Después de venidos estos españoles que fueron a ver la sierra y haberme informado así de ellos como de los naturales de aquel camino que hallaron, hablé a aquellos mensajeros de Mutezuma que conmigo estaban para guiarme a su tierra y les dije que quería ir por aquel camino y no por el que ellos decían, porque era más cerca. Y ellos respondieron que yo decía verdad que era más cerca y más llano y que la causa porque por allí no me encaminaban, era porque habíamos de pasar una jornada por tierra de Guasucingo, que eran sus enemigos, porque allí no teníamos las cosas necesarias como por las tierras del dicho Mutezuma y que pues yo quería ir por allí, que ellos proveerían cómo por la otra parte saliese bastimento al camino, y así nos partimos con harto temor de que aquéllos quisiesen perseverar en hacernos alguna burla. Pero como ya habíamos publicado ser allá nuestro camino no me pareció fuera bien dejarlo ni volver atrás, porque no creyesen que falta de ánimo lo impedía.

Aquel día que de la ciudad de Churultecal me partí, fui cuatro leguas a unas aldeas de la ciudad de Guasucingo, donde de los naturales fui muy bien recibido y me dieron algunas esclavas, ropas y ciertas piecezuelas de oro, que de todo fue bien poco, porque éstos no lo tienen a causa de ser de la liga y parcialidad de los de Tascaltecal y por tenerlos como he dicho Mutezuma los tiene, cercados con su tierra, en tal manera que con ningunas provincias tiene contratación más de en su tierra y a esta causa viven muy probremente. Otro día siguiente subí al puerto por entre las dos sierras que he dicho y a la bajada de él, ya que la tierra del dicho Mutezuma descubríamos, por una provincia de ella que se dice Chalco, dos leguas antes que llegásemos a las poblaciones hallé un muy buen aposento nuevamente hecho, tal y tan grande que muy cumplidamente todos los de mi compañía y yo nos aposentamos en él, aunque llevaba conmigo mas de cuatro mil indios de los naturales de estas provincias de Tascaltecal, Guasucingo, Churultecal y Cempoal y para todos muy cumplidamente de comer y en todas las posadas muy grandes fuegos y mucha leña, porque hacía muy gran frío a causa de estar cercado de las dos sierras y ellas con mucha nieve.

Aquí me vinieron a hablar ciertas personas que parecían principales, entre los cuales venía uno que me dijeron que era hermano de Mutezuma y me trajeron hasta tres mil pesos de oro y de parte de él me dijeron que él me enviaba aquello y me rogaba que me volviese y no curase de ir a su ciudad, porque era tierra muy pobre de comida y que para ir allá había muy mal camino y que estaba toda en agua y que no podía entrar allá sino en canoas y otros muchos inconvenientes que para la ida me pusieron. Y que viese todo lo que quería, que Mutezuma su señor, me lo mandaría dar y que asimismo concertarían de darme en cada un año certum quid, el cual me llevarían hasta la mar o donde yo quisiese. Yo los recibí muy bien y les di algunas cosas de las de nuestra España, de las que ellos tenían en mucho, en especial, al que decían que era hermano de Mutezuma y a su embajador le respondí que si en mi mano fuera volverme que yo lo hiciese por hacer placer a Mutezuma; pero que yo había venido en esta tierra por mandado de vuestra majestad y de la principal cosa que de ella me mandó le hiciese relación, fue del dicho Mutezuma y de aquella su gran ciudad, de la cual y de él había mucho tiempo que vuestra alteza tenía noticia y que le dijesen de mi parte que le rogaba que mi ida a verle tuviese por bien, porque de ella a su persona ni tierra ningún daño, antes pro, se le había de seguir y que después que yo le viese, si fuese su voluntad todavía de no tenerme en su compañía, que yo me volvería y que mejor haríamos entre él y yo, orden en la manera que en el servicio de vuestra alteza él había de tener, que por terceras personas, puesto que ellos eran tales a quien todo crédito se debía de dar. Y con esta respuesta se volvieron. En este aposento que he dicho, según las apariencias que para ello vimos y el aparejo que en él había, los indios tuvieron pensamiento que nos pudieran ofender aquella noche y como yo lo sentí, puse tal recaudo, que conociéndolo ellos, mudaron su pensamiento y muy secretamente hicieron ir aquella noche mucha gente que en los montes que estaban junto al aposento tenían junta, que por muchas de nuestras velas y escuchas fue vista y luego siendo de día, me partí a un pueblo que está dos leguas de allí, que se dice Amecameca que es de la provincia de Chalco, que tendrá en la población principal con las aldeas que hay a dos leguas de él más de veinte mil vecinos y en el dicho pueblo nos aposentaron en unas muy buenas casas del señor del lugar y muchas personas que parecían principales me vinieron allí a hablar diciéndome que Mutezuma su señor los había enviado para que me esperasen allí y me hiciesen proveer de todas las cosas necesarias. El señor de esa provincia y pueblo me dio hasta cuarenta esclavas y tres mil castellanos y dos días que allí estuve nos proveyó muy cumplidamente de todo lo necesario para nuestra comida. Y otro día, yendo conmigo aquellos principales que de parte de Mutezuma me dijeron que me esperaban allí, me partí y fui a dormir cuatro leguas de allí a un pueblo pequeño que está junto a una gran laguna y casi la mitad de él sobre el agua de ella y por la parte de la tierra tiene una sierra muy áspera de piedras y peñas donde nos aposentaron muy bien. Y asimismo quisieran allí probar sus fuerzas con nosotros, excepto que según pareció, quisieran hacerlo muy a su salvo y tomarnos de noche descuidados y como yo iba tan sobre aviso, hallábame delante de sus pensamientos y aquella noche tuve tal guarda, que así de espías que venían por el agua en canoas, como de otras que por la sierra bajaban a ver si había aparejo para ejecutar su voluntad, amanecieron casi quince o veinte que las nuestras las habían tomado y muerto, por manera que pocas volvieron a dar su respuesta del aviso que venían a tomar y con hallarnos siempre tan apercibidos, acordaron de mudar el propósito y llevarnos por bien.

Y otro día por la mañana, ya que me quería partir de aquel pueblo, llegaron hasta diez o doce señores muy principales, según después supe y entre ellos un gran señor mancebo, de hasta veinticinco anos, a quien todos mostraban tener mucho acatamiento y tanto, que después de bajado de unas andas en que venía, todos los otros le venían limpiando las piedras y pajas del suelo delante de él y llegados a donde yo estaba me dijeron que venían de parte de Mutezuma su señor y que los enviaba para que se fuesen conmigo y que me rogaba que le perdonase porque no salía en su persona a verme y recibirme y que la causa era estar mal dispuesto, pero que ya su ciudad estaba cerca y que pues yo todavía determinaba de ir a ella, que allá nos veríamos y conocería de él la voluntad que al servicio de Vuestra Alteza tenía, pero que todavía me rogaba que si fuese posible no fuese allá porque padecería mucho trabajo y necesidad y que él tenía mucha vergüenza de no poderme allá proveer como él deseaba y en esto ahincaron y porfiaron mucho aquellos señores y tanto, que no les quedaba sino decir que me defenderían el camino si todavía porfiase ir. Yo les respondí, satisfice y aplaqué con las mejores palabras que pude, haciéndoles entender que de mi ida no les podía venir daño sino mucho provecho y así se despidieron después de haberles dado algunas cosas de las que yo traía. Y yo partí luego tras ellos muy acompañado de muchas personas que parecían de mucha cuenta como después pareció serio y todavía seguía el camino por la costa de aquella gran laguna y a una legua del aposento donde paré vi dentro en ella, casi dos tiros de ballesta, una ciudad pequeña que podría ser hasta de mil o dos mil vecinos, toda armada sobre el agua, sin haber para ella ninguna entrada y muy torreada, según lo que de fuera parecía y otra legua adelante entramos por una calzada tan ancha como una lanza jineta, por la laguna adentro, de dos tercios de legua y por ella fuimos a dar en una ciudad la más hermosa, aunque pequeña, que hasta entonces habíamos visto, así de muy bien labradas casas y torres como de la buena orden que en el fundamento había por ser armada toda sobre agua y en esta ciudad, que será hasta de dos mil vecinos, nos recibieron muy bien y nos dieron bien de comer y allí me vinieron a hablar el señor y los principales de ella y me rogaron que me quedase allí a dormir y aquellas personas que conmigo iban de Mutezuma me dijeron que no parase, sino que me fuese a otra ciudad que está tres leguas de allí, que se dice Iztapalapa, que es de un hermano del dicho Mutezuma y así lo hice.

Y a la salida de la ciudad donde comimos, cuyo nombre al presente no me ocurre a la memoria, es por otra calzada que tendrá una legua grande hasta llegar a la tierra firme y llegado a esta ciudad de Iztapalapa, me salió a recibir algo fuera de ella el señor y otro de una gran ciudad que está cerca de ella que será obra de tres leguas, que se llama Caluanalcan y otros señores que allí me estaban esperando y me dieron hasta tres mil o cuatro mil castellanos, algunas esclavas, ropa y me hicieron muy buen acogimiento. Tendrá esta ciudad de Iztapalapa doce o quince mil vecinos, la cual está en la costa de una laguna salada, grande, la mitad dentro del agua y la otra mitad en la tierra firme. Tiene el señor de ella unas casas nuevas que aún no están acabadas, que son tan buenas como las mejores de España, digo de grandes y bien labradas, así de obra de cantería como de carpintería, suelos y cumplimientos para todo género de servicios de casa excepto mazonerías y otras cosas ricas que en España usan en las casas, que acá no las tienen. Tiene muchos cuartos altos y bajos, jardines muy frescos de muchos árboles y rosas olorosas; asimismo albercas de agua dulce muy bien labradas, con sus escaleras hasta lo hondo. Tiene una muy grande huerta junto a la casa y sobre ella un mirador de muy hermosos corredores y salas y dentro de la huerta una muy grande alberca de agua dulce, muy cuadrada y las paredes de ella de gentil cantería y alrededor de ella un andén de muy buen suelo ladrillado, tan ancho que pueden ir por él cuatro paseándose y tiene de cuadra cuatrocientos pasos, que son en torno mil seiscientos; de la otra parte del andén hacia la pared de la huerta va todo labrado de cañas con unas vergas y detrás de ellas todo de arboledas y hierbas olorosas y dentro de la alberca hay mucho pescado y muchas aves, así como lavancos, zarzetas y otros géneros de aves de agua, tantas que muchas veces casi cubren el agua.

Otro día después que a esta ciudad llegué me partí y a media legua andada, entré por una calzada que va por medio de esta dicha laguna, dos leguas hasta llegar a la gran ciudad de Temixtitan que está fundada en medio de la dicha laguna, la cual calzada es tan ancha como dos lanzas y muy bien obrada que pueden ir por toda ella ocho de caballo a la par y en estas dos leguas de la una parte y de la otra de la dicha calzada están tres ciudades y la una de ellas que se dice Misicalcingo, está fundada la mayor parte de ella dentro de la dicha laguna y las otras dos, que se llaman la una Niciaca y la otra Huchilohuchico, están en la costa de ella y muchas casas de ellas dentro en el agua. La primera ciudad de éstas tendrá hasta tres mil vecinos y la segunda más de seis mil y la tercera otros cuatro o cinco mil vecinos y en todas muy buenos edificios de casas y torres, en especial las casas de los señores y personas principales y las de sus mezquitas y oratorios donde ellos tienen sus ídolos. En estas ciudades hay mucho trato de sal, que hacen del agua de la dicha laguna y de la superficie que está en la tierra que baña la laguna, la cual cuecen en cierta manera y hacen panes de ella dicha sal, que venden para los naturales y para fuera de la comarca. Y así seguí la dicha calzada y a media legua antes de llegar al cuerpo de la ciudad de Temixtitan, a la entrada de otra calzada que viene a dar de la tierra firme a esta otra, está un muy fuerte baluarte con dos torres cercado de muro de dos estados, con su pretil almacenado por toda la cerca que toma con ambas calzadas y no tiene más de dos puertas, una por donde entran y otra por donde salen.

Aquí me salieron a ver y hablar hasta mil hombres principales, ciudadanos de la dicha ciudad, todos vestidos de una manera de hábito y según su costumbre, bien rico y llegados a hablarme cada uno por sí, hacía en llegando ante mí una ceremonia que entre ellos se usa mucho, que ponía cada uno la mano en tierra y la besaba y así estuve esperando casi una hora hasta que cada uno hiciese su ceremonia.

Y ya junto a la ciudad está un puente de madera de diez pasos de anchura y por allí está abierta la calzada porque tenga lugar el agua de entrar y salir, porque crece y mengua y también por fortaleza de la ciudad porque quitan y ponen algunas vigas muy luengas y anchas de que el dicho puente está hecho, todas las veces que quieren y de éstas hay muchas por toda la ciudad como adelante en la relación que de las cosas de ella haré vuestra alteza verá. Pasado este puente nos salió a recibir aquel señor Mutezuma con hasta doscientos señores, todos descalzos y vestidos de otra librea o manera de ropa asimismo bien rica a su uso y más que la de los otros venían en dos procesiones muy arrimados a las paredes de la calle, que es muy ancha y muy hermosa y derecha, que de un cabo se parece el otro y tiene dos tercios de legua y de la una parte y de la otra muy buenas y grandes casas, así de aposentamientos como de mezquitas y el dicho Mutezuma venía por medio de la calle con dos señores, el uno a la mano derecha y el otro a la izquierda, de los cuales el uno era aquel señor grande que dije que me había salido a hablar en las andas y el otro era su hermano del dicho Mutezuma, señor de aquella ciudad de Iztapalapa de donde yo aquel día había partido, todos tres vestidos de una manera, excepto el Mutezuma que iba calzado y los otros dos señores descalzos; cada uno lo llevaba de su brazo y como nos juntamos, yo me apeé y le fui a abrazar solo y aquellos dos señores que con él iban, me detuvieron con las manos para que no le tocase y ellos y él hicieron asimismo ceremonia de besar la tierra y hecha, mandó a aquel su hermano que venía con él que se quedase conmigo y me llevase por el brazo y él con el otro se iba adelante de mí poquito trecho.

Y después de haberme él hablado, vinieron asimismo a hablarme todos los otros señores que iban en las dos procesiones, en orden uno en pos de otro y luego se tornaban a su procesión y al tiempo que yo llegué a hablar al dicho Mutezuma, me quité un collar que llevaba de margaritas y diamantes de vidrio y se lo eché al cuello y después de haber andado la calle adelante, vino un servidor suyo con dos collares de camarones envueltos en un paño, que eran hechos de huesos de caracoles colorados, que ellos tienen en mucho y de cada collar colgaban ocho camarones de oro de mucha perfección, tan largos casi como un geme y como se los trajeron se volvió a mí y me los echó al cuello. Y tornó a seguir por la calle en la forma ya dicha hasta llegar a una muy grande y hermosa casa que él tenía para aposentarnos, bien aderezada. Y allí me tomó de la mano y me llevó a una gran sala que estaba frontera del patio por donde entramos y allí me hizo sentar en un estrado muy rico que para él lo tenía mandado hacer y me dijo que le esperase allí y él se fue.

Y dende a poco rato, ya que toda la gente de mi compañía estaba aposentada, volvió con muchas y diversas joyas de oro, plata, plumajes y hasta cinco o seis mil piezas de ropa de algodón, muy ricas y de diversas maneras tejidas y labradas y después de habérmelas dado, se sentó en otro estrado que luego le hicieron allí junto con el otro donde yo estaba y sentado, propuso en esta manera: ""Muchos días ha que por nuestras escrituras tenemos de nuestros antepasados noticia que yo ni todos los que en esta tierra habitamos no somos naturales de ella sino extranjeros y venidos a ella de partes muy extrañas y tenemos asimismo que a estas partes trajo nuestra generación un señor cuyos vasallos todos eran, el cual se volvió a su naturaleza y después tornó a venir dende en mucho tiempo y tanto, que ya estaban casados los que habían quedado con las mujeres naturales de la tierra y tenían mucha generación y hechos pueblos donde vivían y queriéndolos llevar consigo, no quisieron ir ni menos recibirle por señor y así se volvió y siempre hemos tenido que los que de él descendiesen habían de venir a sojuzgar esta tierra y a nosotros como a sus vasallos y según de la parte que vos decís que venís, que es a donde sale el sol y las cosas que decís de ese gran señor o rey que acá os envió, creemos y tenemos por cierto, él sea nuestro señor natural, en especial que nos decís que él ha muchos días tenía noticia de nosotros y por tanto, vos sed cierto que os obedeceremos y tendremos por señor en lugar de ese gran señor que vos decís y que en ello no habrá falta ni engaño alguno y bien podéis en toda la tierra, digo que en la que yo en mi señorío poseo, mandar a vuestra voluntad, porque será obedecido y hecho y todo lo que nosotros tenemos es para lo que vos de ello quisiéredes disponer. Y pues estáis en vuestra naturaleza y en vuestra casa, holgad y descansad del trabajo del camino y guerras que habéis tenido, que muy bien sé todos los que se os han ofrecido de Puntunchán acá y bien sé que los de Cempoal y de Tascalecal os han dicho muchos males e mí. No creáis más de lo que por vuestros ojos veredes, en especial de aquellos que son mis enemigos y algunos de ellos eran mis vasallos y se me han rebelado con vuestra venida y por favorecerse con vos lo dicen; los cuales sé que también os han dicho que yo tenía las casas con las paredes de oro y que las esteras de mis estrados y otras cosas de mi servicio eran asimismo de oro y que yo era y me hacía dios y otras muchas cosas. Las casas ya las véis que son de piedra, cal y tierra"" y entonces alzó las vestiduras y me mostró el cuerpo diciendo: ""A mí me veis aquí que soy de carne y hueso como vos y como cada uno y que soy mortal y palpable"", asiéndose él con sus manos de los brazos y del cuerpo: ""Ved cómo os han mentido; verdad es que tengo algunas cosas de oro que me han quedado de mis abuelos; todo lo que yo tuviere tenéis cada vez que vos lo quisiéredes; yo me voy a otras casas donde vivo; aquí seréis provisto de todas las cosas necesarias para vos y para vuestra gente. Y no recibáis pena alguna, pues estáis en vuestra casa y naturaleza"". Yo le respondí a todo lo que me dijo, satisfaciendo a aquello que me pareció que convenía, en especial en hacerle creer que vuestra majestad era a quien ellos esperaban y con esto se despidió e ido, fuimos muy bien provistos de muchas gallinas, pan, frutas y otras cosas necesarias, especialmente para el servicio del aposento y de esta manera estuve seis días, muy bien provisto de todo lo necesario y visitado de muchos de aquellos señores.

Ya, muy católico Señor, dije al principio de ésta cómo a la sazón que yo me partí de la Villa de la Veracruz en demanda de este señor Mutezuma, dejé en ella ciento cincuenta hombres para hacer aquella fortaleza que dejaba comenzada y dije asimismo cómo había dejado muchas villas y fortalezas de las comarcanas a aquella villa, puestas debajo del real dominio de vuestra alteza y a los naturales de ella muy seguros.

Y por ciertos vasallos de vuestra majestad, que estando en la ciudad de Chururtecal recibí letras del capitán que yo en mi lugar dejé en la dicha villa, por las cuales me hizo saber cómo Qualpopoca, señor de aquella ciudad que se dice Almería, le había enviado decir por sus mensajeros que él tenía de ser vasallo de vuestra alteza y que si hasta entonces no había venido tu venía a dar obediencia que era obligado y a ofrecerse por tal vasallo de vuestra majestad con todas sus tierras, la causa era que había de pasar por tierra de sus enemigos y que temiendo ser ,de ellos ofendido, lo dejaba; pero que le enviase cuatro españoles que viniesen con el, porque aquellos por cuya tierra había de pasar, sabiendo a lo que él vendría luego y que el dicho capitán, creyendo ser cierto lo que el dicho Qualpopoca le enviaba a decir y que así lo habían hecho otros muchos, le había enviado los dichos cuatro españoles y que después que en su casa los tuvo, los mandó matar por cierta manera, como que pareciese que él no lo hacía y que habían muerto los dos de ellos y los otros dos se habían escapado por unos montes, heridos y que él había ido sobre la dicha cuidad de Almería con cincuenta españoles y los dos de caballo y dos tiros de pólvora y con hasta ocho o diez mil indios de los amigos nuestros y que había peleado con los naturales de la dicha ciudad y le habían matado seis o siete españoles y había tomado la dicha ciudad y muertos muchos de los naturales de ella y los demás echados fuera y que la habían quemado y destruido, porque los indios que en su compañía llevaban, como eran sus enemigos, habían puesto en ello mucha diligencia y que el dicho Qualpopoca, señor de la dicha ciudad, con otros señores sus aliados que en su favor habían venido allí, se habían escapado huyendo y que de algunos prisioneros que tomó en la dicha ciudad, se habían informado cuyos eran los que allí estaban en defensa de ella y la causa porque habían matado a los españoles que él envió, la cual dice que fue el dicho Mutezuma había mandado al dicho Qualpopoca y a los otros que allí habían venido como a sus vasallos que eran, que salido yo de aquella Villa de la Veracruz fuesen sobre aquellos que se le habían alzado y ofrecido al servicio de vuestra alteza y que tuviesen todas las formas que ser pudiesen para matar los españoles que yo allí dejase porque no le ayudasen ni favoreciesen y que a esta causa lo habían hecho.

Pasados, invictísimo Señor, seis días después que en la gran ciudad de Timixtitan entré y habiendo visto algunas cosas de ella, aunque pocas, según las que hay que ver y notar, por aquéllas me pareció y aun por lo que de la tierra había visto, que convenía al real servicio de vuestra majestad y a nuestra seguridad, que aquel señor estuviese en mi poder y no en toda su libertad, porque no mudase el propósito y voluntad que mostraba en servir a vuestra majestad, mayormente que los españoles somos algo incomportables e importunos y porque enojándose nos podría hacer mucho daño y tanto, que no hubiese memoria de nosotros según su gran poder y también porque teniéndole conmigo, todas las otras tierras que a él eran súbditas, vendrían más aína al conocimiento y servicio de vuestra majestad, como después sucedió. Determiné de prenderle y ponerle en el aposento donde yo estaba, que era bien fuerte y porque en su prisión no hubiese algún escándalo ni alboroto, pensado todas las formas y maneras que para hacerlo sin éste debía tener, me acordé de lo que el capitán que en la Veracruz había dejado, me había escrito, cerca de lo que había acaecido en la ciudad de Almería, según que en el capítulo antes de éste he dicho y cómo se había sabido que todo lo allí sucedido había sido por mandado del dicho Mutezuma y dejando buen recaudo en las encrucijadas de las calles, me fui a las casas del dicho Mutezuma como otras veces había ido a verle y después de haberle hablado en burlas y cosas de placer y de haberme él dado algunas joyas de oro y una hija suya y otras hijas de señores a algunos de mi compañía, le dije que ya sabía lo que en la ciudad de Nautecal o Almería había acaecido y los españoles que en ella me habían matado y que Qualpopoca daba por disculpa que todo lo que había hecho había sido por su mandado y que como su vasallo, no había podido hacer otra cosa y porque yo creía que no era así como el dicho Qualpopoca decía, que antes era por excusarse de culpa, que me parecía que debía enviar por él y por los otros principales que en la muerte de aquellos españoles se habían hallado, porque la verdad se supiese y que ellos fuesen castigados y vuestra majestad supiese su buena voluntad claramente y en lugar de las mercedes que vuestra alteza le había de mandar hacer, los dichos de aquellos malos no provocasen a vuestra alteza a ira contra él, por donde le mandase hacer daño, pues la verdad era al contrario de lo que aquéllos decían y yo estaba de él bien satisfecho.

Y luego a la hora mandó llamar ciertas personas de los suyos, a los cuales dio una figura de piedra pequeña, a manera de sello, que él tenía atado en el brazo y les mandó que fuesen a la dicha ciudad de Almería, que está sesenta o setenta leguas de la de Tenuxtitan y que trajesen al dicho Qualpopoca y se informasen en los demás que habían sido en la muerte de aquellos españoles y que asimismo los trajesen y que si por su voluntad no quisiesen venir los trajesen presos y si se pusiesen en resistir la prisión, que requiriesen a ciertas comunidades comarcanas a aquella ciudad que allí les señaló, para que fuesen con mano armada para prenderlos, por manera que no viniesen sin ellos. Los cuales, luego partieron y así idos, le dije al dicho Mutezuma que yo le agradecía la diligencia que ponía en la prisión de aquéllos, porque yo había de dar cuenta a vuestra alteza de aquellos españoles y que restaba para yo darla, que él estuviese en mi posada hasta tanto que la verdad más se aclarase y se supiese él ser sin culpa y que le rogaba mucho que no recibiese pena de ello, porque él no había de estar como preso sino en toda su libertad y que en servicio ni en el mando de su señorío, yo no le ponía ningún impedimento y que escogiese un cuarto de aquel aposento donde yo estaba, cual él quisiese y que allí estaría muy a su placer y que fuese cierto que ningún enojo ni pena se le había de dar, antes además de su servicio, los de mi compañía le servirían en todo lo que él mandase; acerca de esto pasamos muchas pláticas y razones que serían largas para escribir y aun para dar cuenta de ellas a vuestra alteza, algo prolijas y también no sustanciales para el caso y por tanto no diré más de que finalmente él dijo que le placía de irse conmigo y mandó luego ir a aderezar el aposentamiento donde él quiso estar, el cual fue muy puesto y bien aderezado.

Y hecho esto, vinieron muchos señores y quitadas las vestiduras y puestas por bajo de los brazos y descalzos traían unas andas no muy bien aderezadas y llorando lo tomaron en ellas con mucho silencio y así nos fuimos hasta el aposento donde estaba, sin haber alboroto en la ciudad, aunque se comenzó a mover; pero sabido por el dicho Mutezuma, envió a mandar que no lo hubiese. Y así hubo toda quietud según que antes la había y la hubo todo el tiempo que yo tuve preso al dicho Mutezuma, porque él estaba muy a su placer y con todo su servicio, según en su casa lo tenía; que era bien grande y maravilloso, según adelante diré. Y yo y los de mi compañía le hacíamos todo el placer que a nosotros era posible.

Y habiendo pasado quince días o veinte días de su prisión, vinieron aquellas personas que había enviado por Qualpopoca y los otros que habían matado a los españoles y trajeron al dicho Qualpopoca y a un hijo suyo y con ellos quince personas que decían que eran principales y habían sido en la dicha muerte. Y al dicho Qualpopoca traían en unas andas y muy a manera de señor, como de hecho lo era y traídos me los entregaron y yo los hice poner a buen recaudo con sus prisiones y después que confesaron haber matado a los españoles, les hice interrogar si ellos eran vasallos de Mutezuma y el dicho Qualpopoca respondió que si había otro señor de quien pudiese serio, casi diciendo que no había otro y que sí eran. Y asimismo les pregunté si lo que allí se había hecho había sido por su mandado y dijeron que no, aunque después, al tiempo que en ellos se ejecutó la sentencia que fuesen quemados, todos a una voz dijeron que era verdad que el dicho Mutezuma se lo había enviado a mandar y que por su mandado lo habían hecho. Y así fueron éstos quemados públicamente en una plaza, sin haber alboroto alguno y el día que se quemaron, porque confesaron que el dicho Mutezuma les había mandado que matasen a aquellos españoles, le hice echar unos grillos, de que él no recibió poco espanto, aunque después de haberle hablado aquel día, se los quité y él quedó muy contento y de allí adelante siempre trabajé de agradarle y contentarle en todo lo a mí posible, en especial que siempre publiqué y dije a todos los naturales de la tierra, así señores como los que a mí venían, que vuestra majestad era servido que el dicho Mutezuma se estuviese en su señorío reconociendo el que vuestra alteza sobre él tenía y que servirían mucho a vuestra alteza en le obedecer y tener por señor, como antes que yo a la tierra viniese le tenían.

Y fue el buen tratamiento que yo le hice y el contentamiento que de mí tenía, que algunas veces y muchas le acometí con su libertad, rogándole que fuese a su casa y me dijo todas las veces que se lo decía que él estaba bien allí y que no quería irse, porque allí no le faltaba cosa de lo que él quería, como si en su casa estuviese y que podría ser que yéndose y habiendo lugar, que los señores de la tierra sus vasallos le importunasen o le induciesen a que hiciese alguna cosa contra su voluntad, que fuese fuera del servicio de vuestra alteza y que él tenía propuesto de servir a vuestra alteza en todo lo a él posible y que hasta tanto que los tuviese informados de lo que quería hacer y que él estaba bien allí, porque aunque alguna cosa le quisiesen decir, que con responderles que no estaba en su libertad se podría excusar y eximir de ellos y muchas veces me pidió licencia para irse a holgar y pasar tiempo a ciertas casas de placer que él tenía, así fuera de la ciudad como dentro y ninguna vez se la negué. Y fue muchas veces a holgar con cinco o seis españoles a una o dos leguas fuera de la ciudad y volvía siempre muy alegre y contento al aposento donde yo le tenía y siempre que salía hacía muchas mercedes de joyas y ropa, así a los españoles que con él iban, como a sus naturales, de los cuales siempre iba tan acompañado, que cuando menos con él iban, pasaban de tres mil hombres, que los más de ellos eran señores y personas principales y siempre les hacía muchos banquetes y fiestas, que los que con él iban tenían bien que contar.

Después que yo conocí de él muy por entero tener mucho deseo al servicio de vuestra majestad, le rogué que porque más enteramente yo pudiese hacer relación a vuestra majestad de las cosas de esta tierra, que me mostrase las minas de donde se sacaba el oro, el cual con muy alegre voluntad, según mostró, dijo que le placía y luego hizo venir ciertos servidores suyos y de dos en dos repartió para cuatro provincias donde dijo que se sacaba y pidióme que le diese españoles que fuesen con ellos para que lo viesen sacar y asimismo yo le di a cada dos de los suyos, otros dos españoles. Y los unos fueron a una provincia que se dice Cuzula, que es ochenta leguas de la gran ciudad de Temixtitan y los naturales de aquella provincia son vasallos del dicho Mutezuma y allí les mostraron tres ríos y de todos me trajeron muestras de oro y muy buena, aunque sacada con poco aparejo porque no tenían otros instrumentos más de aquel con que los indios lo sacan y en el camino pasaron tres provincias, según los españoles dijeron, de muy hermosa tierra y de muchas villas, ciudades y otras poblaciones en mucha cantidad y de tales y tan buenos edificios, que dicen que en España no podían ser mejores. En especial me dijeron que habían visto una casa de aposentamiento y fortaleza que es mayor y más fuerte y mejor edificada que el castillo de Burgos y la gente de una de estas provincias que se llama Tamazulapa, era mas vestida que esta otra que hemos visto y según a ellos les pareció, de mucha razón. Los otros fueron a otra provincia que se dice Malinaltepeque, que es otras setenta leguas de la dicha gran ciudad, que es más hacia la costa del mar y asimismo me trajeron muestra de oro de un río grande que por allí pasa. Y los otros fueron a una tierra que está este río arriba, que es de una gente diferente de la lengua de Culúa, a la cual llaman Tenis y el señor de aquella tierra se llama Coatelicamat y por tener su tierra en unas sierras muy altas y ásperas no es sujeto al dicho Mutezuma y también porque la gente de aquella provincia es gente muy guerrera y pelean con lanzas de veinticinco y treinta palmos y por no ser éstos vasallos del dicho Mutezuma, los mensajeros que con los españoles iban no osaron entrar en la tierra sin hacerlo saber primero al señor de ella y pedir para ello licencia, diciéndole que iban con aquellos españoles a ver las minas de oro que tenían en su tierra y que le rogaban de mi parte y del dicho Mutezuma su señor, que lo hubiesen por bien. El cual dicho Coatelicamat respondió que los españoles, que él era muy contento que entrasen en su tierra y viesen las minas y todo lo demás que ellos quisiesen, pero que los de Culúa, que son los de Mutezuma, no habían de entrar en su tierra porque eran sus enemigos.

Algo estuvieron los españoles perplejos en si irían o no, porque los que con ellos iban les dijeron que no fuesen que les matarían y que por matarlos no consentían que los de Culúa entrasen con ellos y al fin se determinaron a entrar solos y fueron del dicho señor y de los de su tierra muy bien recibidos y les mostraron siete u ocho ríos de donde dijeron que ellos sacaban el oro y en su presencia los sacaron los indios y ellos me trajeron muestra de todos y con los dichos españoles me envió el dicho Coatelicamat ciertos mensajeros suyos con los cuales me envió a ofrecer su persona y tierra al servicio de vuestra sacra majestad y me envió ciertas joyas de oro y ropa de la que ellos tienen; los otros fueron a otra provincia que se dice Tuchitebeque, que es casi en el mismo derecho hacia la mar, doce leguas de la provincia de Malinaltebeque, donde ya he dicho que se halló oro y allá les mostraron otros dos ríos de donde asimismo sacaron muestra de oro.

Y porque allí, según los españoles que allá fueron me informaron, que hay mucho aparejo para hacer estancias para sacar oro, rogué al dicho Mutezuma que en aquella provincia de Malinaltebeque, porque era para ello más aparejada, hiciese hacer una estancia para Vuestra Majestad y puso en ello tanta diligencia, que dende en dos meses que yo se lo dije, estaban sembradas sesenta hanegas de maíz, diez de fríjoles y dos mil de cacao, que es una fruta como almendras, que ellos venden molida y la tienen en tanto, que se trata por moneda en toda la tierra y con ella se compran todas las cosas necesarias en los mercados y otras partes. Y había hechas cuatro casas muy buenas, en que la una, demás de los aposentamientos hicieron un estanque de agua y en él pusieron quinientos patos, que acá tienen en mucho, porque se aprovechan de la pluma de ellos y los pelan cada año y hacen sus ropas con ella y pusieron hasta mil quinientas gallinas, sin otros aderezos de granjerías, que muchas veces juzgadas por los españoles que las vieron, las apreciaban en veinte mil pesos de oro.

Asimismo le rogué al dicho Mutezuma que me dijese si en la costa de la mar había algún río o ancón en que los navíos que viniesen pudiesen entrar y estar seguros. El cual me respondió que no lo sabía; pero que él me haría pintar toda la costa, ancones y ríos de ella y que enviase yo españoles a verlos y que él me daría quien los guiase y fuese con ellos y así lo hizo. Otro día me trajeron figurada en un paño toda la costa y en ella parecía un río que salía a la mar, más abierto, según la figura, que los otros; el cual parecía estar entre las sierras que dicen San Martín y son tan altas que forman un ancón por donde los pilotos hasta entonces creían que se partía la tierra en una provincia que se dice Mazamalco y me dijo que viese yo a quién quería enviar y que él proveería a quién y cómo se viese y supiese todo. Y luego señalé diez hombres y entre ellos algunos pilotos y personas que sabían de la mar y con el recaudo que él dio se partieron y fueron por toda la costa desde el puerto de Chalchilmeca, que dicen de San Juan, donde yo desembarqué y anduvieron por ella setenta y tantas leguas, que en ninguna parte hallaron río ni ancón donde pudiesen entrar navíos ningunos, puesto que en la dicha costa había muchos y muy grandes y todos los sondaron con canoas y así llegaron a la dicha provincia de Cuacalcalco, donde el dicho río está.

El señor de aquella provincia, que se dice Tuchintecla, los recibió muy bien y les dio canoas para mirar el río y hallaron en la entrada de él dos brazas y media largas en lo más bajo del bojar y subieron por el dicho río arriba, doce leguas y lo más bajo que en él hallaron fueron cinco o seis brazas. Y según lo que de él vieron, se cree que sube más de treinta leguas de aquella hondura y en la ribera de él hay muchas y grandes poblaciones y toda la provincia es muy llana y muy fuerte y abundosa de todas las cosas de la tierra y de mucha y casi innumerable gente. Y los de esta provincia no son vasallos ni súbditos de Mutezuma, antes sus enemigos. Asimismo, el señor de ella, al tiempo que los españoles llegaron, les envió a decir que los de Culúa no entrasen en su tierra, porque eran sus enemigos. Y cuando se volvieron los españoles a mí con esta relación, envió con ellos ciertos mensajeros con los cuales me envió ciertas joyas de oro, cueros de tigres, plumajes, piedras y ropa y ellos me dijeron de su parte que había muchos días que Tuchintecla, su señor, tenía noticia de mí porque los de Putunchán, que es el río de Grijalva, que son sus amigos, le habían hecho saber cómo yo había pasado por allí y había peleado con ellos porque no me dejaban entrar en su pueblo y cómo después quedamos amigos y ellos por vasallos de vuestra majestad y que él asimismo se ofrecía a su real servicio con toda su tierra y me rogaba que les tuviese por amigo, con tal condición que los de Culúa no entrasen en su tierra y que yo viese las cosas que en ella había de que se quisiese servir vuestra alteza y que él daría de ellas las que yo señalase en cada un año.

Como de los españoles que vinieron de esta provincia me informé ser ella aparejada para poblar y del puerto que en ella habían hallado, holgué mucho, porque después que en esta tierra salté siempre he trabajado de buscar puerto en la costa de ella, tal que estuviese a propósito de poblar y jamás lo había hallado ni lo hay en toda la costa desde el río San Antón, que es junto al de Grijalva, hasta el de Pánuco, que es la costa abajo, adonde ciertos españoles, por mandado de Francisco de Garay, fueron a poblar, de que adelante a vuestra alteza haré relación.

Y para más certificarme de las cosas de aquella provincia y puerto y de la voluntad de los naturales de ella y de las otras cosas necesarias a la población, torné a enviar ciertas personas de las de mi compañía, que tenían alguna experiencia, para alcanzar lo susodicho. Los cuales fueron con los mensajeros que aquel señor Tuchintecla me había enviado y con algunas cosas que yo les di para él y llegados fueron de él bien recibidos y tornaron a ver y sondar el puerto y el río y ver los asientos que había en él para hacer el pueblo y de todo me trajeron verdadera y larga relación y dijeron que había todo lo necesario para poblar y que el señor de la provincia estaba muy contento y con mucho deseo de servir a vuestra alteza. Y venidos con esta relación, luego despaché un capitán con ciento cincuenta hombres, para que fuesen a trazar y formar el pueblo y hacer una fortaleza, porque el señor de aquella provincia se me había ofrecido de hacerla y asimismo todas las cosas que fuesen menester le mandasen y aun hizo seis en el asiento que para el pueblo señalaron y dijo que era muy contento que fuésemos allí a poblar y estar en su tierra.

En los capítulos pasados, muy poderoso señor, dije cómo al tiempo que yo iba a la gran ciudad de Temixtitan, me había salido al camino un gran señor que venía de parte de Mutezuma y según lo que después de él supe, él era muy cercano deudo del dicho Mutezuma y tenía su señorío junto al del dicho Mutezuma, cuyo nombre era Haculuacán. Y la cabeza de él es una muy gran ciudad que está junto a esta laguna salada, que hay desde ella, yendo en canoas por la dicha laguna hasta la dicha ciudad de Temixtitan, seis leguas y por la tierra diez. Llámase esta ciudad Tezcuco y será de hasta treinta mil vecinos. Tienen, señor, en ella, muy maravillosas casas, mezquitas y oratorios muy grandes y muy bien labrados. Hay muy grandes mercados y demás de esta ciudad tiene otras dos, la una de tres leguas de esta de Tezcuco, que se llama Acuruman y la otra a seis leguas, que se dice Otumpa. Tendrá cada una de éstas, hasta tres mil o cuatro mil vecinos. Tiene la dicha provincia y señorío de Haculuacán, otras aldeas y alquerías en mucha cantidad y muy buenas tierras y sus labranzas. Confina todo este señorío, Por la una parte con la provincia de Tascaltecal, de que ya a vuestra majestad he dicho. Este señor que se dice Cacamazin, después de la prisión de Mutezuma se rebeló así contra el servicio de vuestra alteza, a quien se había ofrecido, como contra el dicho Mutezuma. Y puesto que por muchas veces fue requerido que viniese a obedecer los reales mandamientos de vuestra majestad, nunca quiso, aunque demás de lo que yo le enviaba a requerir, el dicho Mutezuma se lo enviaba a mandar; antes respondía que si algo le querían, que fuesen a su tierra y que allá verían para cuánto era y el servicio que era obligado a hacer. Y según yo me informé, tenia gran copia de gente de guerra junta y todos para ella bien a punto. Y como por amonestaciones ni requerimientos yo no lo pude atraer, hablé al dicho Mutezuma y le pedí su parecer de lo que debíamos hacer para que aquél no quedase sin castigo de su rebelión. El cual me respondió que quererle tomar por guerra que se ofrecía mucho peligro, porque él era gran señor y tenía muchas fuerzas y gente y que no se podía tomar tan sin peligro que no muriese mucha gente. Pero que él tenía en su tierra del dicho Cacamazin muchas personas principales que vivía con él y les daba su salario, que él hablaría con ellos para que atrajesen alguna de la gente del dicho Cacamazin a sí y que atraída y estando seguros que aquéllos favorecerían nuestro partido y se podría prender seguramente. Y así fue que el dicho Mutezuma hizo sus conciertos de tal manera, que aquellas personas atrajeron al dicho Cacamazin a que se juntase con ellos en la dicha ciudad de Tezcuco, para dar orden en las cosas que convenían a su estado como personas principales y que les dolía que él hiciese cosas por donde se perdiese. Y así se juntaron en una muy gentil casa del dicho Cacamazin, que está junto a la costa de la laguna y es de tal manera edificada, que por debajo de toda ella navegan las canoas y salen a la dicha laguna. Allí secretamente tenían aderezadas ciertas canoas con mucha gente apercibida, para si el dicho Cacamazin quisiese resistir la prisión. Y estando en la consulta lo tomaron todos aquellos principales antes que fuesen sentidos de la gente del dicho Cacamazin y lo metieron en aquellas canoas y salieron a la laguna y pasaron a la gran ciudad, que como ya dije, está seis leguas de allí y llegados lo pusieron en unas andas como su estado requería y lo acostumbraban y me lo trajeron; al cual yo hice echar unos grillos y poner a mucho recaudo. Y tomado el parecer de Mutezuma, puse en nombre de vuestra alteza, en aquel señorío, a un hijo suyo que se decía Cucuzcacin, al cual hice que todas las comunidades y señores de la dicha provincia y señorío le obedeciesen por señor hasta tanto que vuestra alteza fuese servido de otra cosa. Y así se hizo, que de allí adelante todos lo tuvieron y lo obedecieron por señor como al dicho Cacamazin y él fue obediente en todo o que yo de parte de vuestra majestad le mandaba.

Pasados algunos pocos días después de la prisión de este Cacamazin, el dicho Mutezuma hizo llamamiento y congregación de todos los señores de las ciudades y tierras allí comarcanas y juntos, me envió a decir que subiese allí adonde él estaba con ellos y llegado yo, les habló de esta manera: ""Hermanos y amigos míos, ya sabéis que de mucho tiempo acá vosotros y vuestros padres y abuelos habéis sido y sois súbditos y vasallos de mis antecesores y míos y siempre de ellos y de mí habéis sido muy bien tratados y honrados y vosotros asimismo habéis hecho lo que buenos y leales vasallos son obligados a sus naturales señores y también creo que de vuestros antecesores tenéis memoria cómo nosotros no somos naturales de esta tierra y que vinieron a ella de muy lejos tierra y los trajo un señor que en ella los dejó, cuyos vasallos todos eran. El cual volvió dende ha mucho tiempo y halló que nuestros abuelos estaba ya poblados y asentados en esta tierra y casados con las mujeres de esta tierra y tenían mucha multiplicación de hijos, por manera que no quisieron volverse con el ni menos lo quisieron recibir por señor de la tierra y él se volvió y dejó dicho que tornaría o enviaría con tal poder, que los pudiese costreñir y atraer a su servicio. Y bien sabéis que siempre lo hemos esperado y según las cosas que el capitán nos ha dicho de aquel rey y señor que le envió acá y según la parte de donde él dice que viene, tengo por acierto y así lo debéis vosotros tener, que aqueste es el señor que esperábamos, en especial que nos dice que allá tenía noticia de nosotros y pues nuestros predecesores no hicieron lo que a su señor eran obligados, hagámoslo nosotros y demos gracias a nuestros dioses porque en nuestros tiempos vino lo que tanto aquéllos esperaban. Y mucho os ruego, pues a todos es notorio todo esto, que así como hasta aquí a mí me habéis tenido y obedecido por señor vuestro, de aquí en adelante tengáis y obedezcáis a este gran rey, pues él es vuestro natural señor y en su lugar tengáis a este su capitán y todos los tributos y servicios que hasta aquí a mí me hacíades, hacedlos y dadlos a él, porque yo asimismo tengo de contribuir y servir con todo lo que me mandare y demás de hacer lo que debéis y sois obligados, a mí me haréis en ello mucho placer"". Lo cual todo lo dijo llorando con las mayores lágrimas y suspiros que un hombre podía manifestar y asimismo todos aquellos señores que le estaban oyendo lloraban tanto, que en gran rato no le pudieron responder. Y certifico a vuestra sacra majestad, que no había tal de los españoles que oyese el razonamiento, que no hubiese mucha compasión.

Y después de algo sosegadas sus lágrimas, respondieron que ellos lo tenían por su señor y habían prometido de hacer todo lo que les mandase y que por esto y por la razón que para ello les daba, que eran muy contentos de hacerlo y que desde entonces para siempre se daban ellos por vasallos de vuestra alteza y desde allí todos juntos y cada uno por sí prometían y prometieron, de hacer y cumplir todo aquello que con el real nombre de vuestra majestad les fuese mandado, como buenos y leales vasallos lo deben hacer y de acudir con todos los atributos y servicios que antes al dicho Mutezuma hacían y eran obligados y con todo lo demás que le fuese mandado en nombre de vuestra alteza. Lo cual todo pasó ante un escribano público y lo asentó por auto en forma y yo lo pedí así por testimonio en presencia de muchos españoles.

Pasado este auto y ofrecimiento que estos señores hicieron al real servicio de vuestra majestad, hablé un día al dicho Mutezuma y le dije que vuestra alteza tenía necesidad de oro para ciertas obras que mandaba hacer y que le rogaba que enviase algunas personas de los suyos y que yo enviaría asimismo algunos españoles por las tierras y casas de aquellos señores que allí se habían ofrecido, a rogarles que de lo que ellos tenían sirviesen a vuestra majestad con alguna parte, porque demás de la necesidad que vuestra alteza tenía, parecería que ellos comenzaban a servir y vuestra alteza tendría más concepto de las voluntades que a su servicio mostraban y que él asimismo me diese de lo que tenía, porque lo quería enviar, como el oro y como las otras cosas que había enviado a vuestra majestad con los pasajeros. Y luego mandó que le diese los españoles que quería enviar y de dos en dos y de cinco en cinco, los repartió para muchas provincias y ciudades, cuyos nombres, por haberse perdido las escrituras, no me acuerdo, porque son muchos y diversos, más de que algunas de ellas están a ochenta y a cien leguas de la dicha gran ciudad de Temixtitan y con ellos envió de los suyos y les mandó que fuesen a los señores de aquellas provincias y ciudades y les dijese cómo yo mandaba que cada uno de ellos diese cierta medida de oro que les dio. Y así se hizo que todos aquellos señores a que él envió dieron muy cumplidamente lo que se les pidió, así en joyas como en tejuelos y hojas de oro y plata. Y otras cosas de las que ellos tenían, que fundido todo lo que era para fundir, cupo a vuestra majestad del quinto, treinta y dos mil y cuatrocientos y tantos pesos de oro, sin todas las joyas de oro, plata, plumajes, piedras y otras muchas cosas de valor que para vuestra sacra majestad yo asigné y aparté, que podrían valer cien mil ducados y más suma; las cuales demás de su valor eran tales y tan maravillosas que consideradas por su novedad y extrañeza, no tenían precio ni es de creer que alguno de todos los príncipes del mundo de quien se tiene noticia las pudiese tener tales y de tal calidad. Y no le parezca a vuestra majestad fabuloso lo que digo, pues es verdad que todas las cosas criadas así en la tierra como en la mar, de que el dicho Mutezuma pudiese tener conocimiento, tenían contrahechas muy al natural, así de oro como de plata, como de pedrería y de plumas, en tanta perfección, que casi ellas mismas parecían; de las cuales todas me dio para vuestra alteza mucha parte, sin otras que yo le di figuradas y él las mandó hacer de oro, así como imágenes, crucifijos, medallas, joyeles, collares y otras muchas cosas de las nuestras, que les hice contrahacer. Cupieron asimismo a vuestra alteza del quinto de la plata que se hubo, ciento y tantos marcos, los cuales hice labrar a los naturales, de platos grandes y pequeños, escudillas, tazas y cucharas y lo labraron tan perfecto como se lo podíamos dar a entender.

Demás de esto, me dio el dicho Mutezuma mucha ropa de la suya, que era tal, que considerada ser toda de algodón y sin seda, en todo el mundo no se podía hacer ni tejer otra tal ni de tantas ni tan diversos y naturales colores ni labores; en que había ropas de hombres y de mujeres muy maravillosas, y había paramentos para camas, que hechos de seda no se podían comparar; y había otros paños como de tapicería que podían servir en salas y en iglesias; había colchas y cobertores de cama, así de pluma como de algodón, de diversos colores asimismo muy maravillosos, y otras muchas cosas que por ser tantas y tales no las sé significar a vuestra majestad. También me dio una docena de cerbatanas de las con que él tiraba, que tampoco no sabré decir a vuestra alteza su perfección porque eran todas pintadas de muy excelentes pinturas y perfectos matices, en que había figuradas muchas maneras de avecicas y animales y árboles y flores y otras diversas cosas, y tenían los brocales y puntería tan grandes como un geme de oro, y en el medio otro tanto muy labrado. Dióme para con ellas un carniel de red de oro para los bodoques, que también me dijo que me había de dar de oro, y dióme unas turquesas de oro y otras muchas cosas, cuyo número es casi infinito.

Porque para dar cuenta, muy poderoso señor, a vuestra real excelencia, de la grandeza, extrañas y maravillosas cosas de esta gran ciudad de Temixtitan, del señorío y servicio de este Mutezuma, señor de ella, y de los ritos y costumbres que esta gente tiene, y de la orden que en la gobernación, así de esta ciudad como de las otras que eran de este señor, hay, sería menester mucho tiempo y ser muchos relatores y muy expertos; no podré yo decir de cien partes una, de las que de ellas se podrían decir, mas como pudiere diré algunas cosas de las que vi, que aunque mal dichas, bien sé que serán de tanta admiración que no se podrán creer, porque los que acá con nuestros propios ojos las vemos, no las podemos con el entendimiento comprender. Pero puede vuestra majestad ser cierto que si alguna falta en mi relación hubiere, que será antes por corto que por largo, así en esto como en todo lo demás de que diere cuenta a vuestra alteza, porque me parecía justo a mi príncipe y señor, decir muy claramente la verdad sin interponer cosas que la disminuyan y acrecienten.

Antes que comience a relatar las cosas de esta gran ciudad y las otras que en este capítulo dije, me parece, para que mejor se puedan entender, que débese decir de la manera de México, que es donde esta ciudad y algunas de las otras que he hecho relación están fundadas, y donde está el principal señorío de este Mutezuma. La cual dicha provincia es redonda y está toda cercada de muy altas y ásperas sierras, y lo llano de ella tendrá en torno hasta setenta leguas, y en el dicho llano hay dos lagunas que casi lo ocupan todo, porque tienen canoas en torno más de cincuenta leguas. Y la una de estas dos lagunas es de agua dulce, y la otra, que es mayor, es de agua salada; divídelas por una parte una cuadrilla pequeña de cerros muy latos que están en medio de esta llanura, y al cabo se van a juntar las dichas lagunas en un estrecho de llano que entre estos cerros y las sierras altas se hace. El cual estrecho tendrá un tiro de ballesta, y por entre una laguna y la otra, y las ciudades y otras poblaciones que están en las dichas lagunas, contratan las unas con las otras en sus canoas por el agua, sin haber necesidad de ir por la tierra. Y porque esta laguna salada grande crece y mengua por sus mareas según hace la mar todas las crecientes, corre el agua de ella a la otra dulce tan recio como si fuese caudaloso río, y por consiguiente a las menguantes va la dulce a la salada.

Esta gran ciudad de Temixtitan está fundada en esta laguna salada, y desde la tierra firme hasta el cuerpo de la dicha ciudad, por cualquiera parte que quisieren entrar a ella, hay dos leguas. Tienen cuatro entradas, todas de calzada hecha a mano, tan ancha como dos lanzas jinetas. Es tan grande la ciudad como Sevilla y Córdoba. Son las calles de ella, digo las principales, muy anchas y muy derechas, y algunas de éstas y todas las demás son la mitad de tierra y por la otra mitad es agua, por la cual andan en sus canoas, y todas las calles de trecho a trecho están abiertas por donde atraviesa el agua de las unas a las otras, y en todas estas aberturas, que algunas son muy anchas hay sus puentes de muy anchas y muy grandes vigas, juntas y recias y bien labradas, y tales, que por muchas de ellas pueden pasar diez de a caballo juntos a la par. Y viendo que si los naturales de esta ciudad quisiesen hacer alguna traición, tenían para ello mucho aparejo, por ser la dicha ciudad edificada de la manera que digo, y quitadas las puentes de las entradas salidas, nos podrían dejar morir de hambre sin que pudiésemos salir a la tierra; luego que entré en la dicha ciudad di mucha prisa en hacer cuatro bergantines, y los hice en muy breve tiempo, tales que podían echar trescientos hombres en la tierra y llevar los caballos cada vez que quisiésemos.

Tiene esta ciudad muchas plazas donde hay continuo mercado y trato de comprar y vender. Tiene otra plaza tan grande como dos veces la ciudad de Salamanca, toda cercada de portales alrededor, donde hay cotidianamente arriba de sesenta mil ánimas comprando y vendiendo; donde hay todos los géneros de mercadurías que en todas las tierras se hallan, así de mantenimientos como de vituallas, joyas de oro y de plata, de plomo, de latón, de cobre, de estaño, de piedras, de huesos, de conchas, de caracoles y de plumas. Véndese cal, piedra labrada y por labrar, adobes, ladrillos, madera labrada y por labrar de diversas maneras. Hay calle de caza donde venden todos los linajes de aves que hay en la tierra, así como gallinas, perdices, codornices, lavancos, dorales, zarcetas, tórtolas, palomas, pajaritos en cañuela, papagayos, búharos, águilas, halcones, gavilanes y cernícalos; y de algunas de estas aves de rapiña, venden los cueros con su pluma y cabezas y pico y uñas.

Venden conejos, liebres, venados, y perros pequeños, que crían para comer, castrados. Hay calle de herbolarios, donde hay todas las raíces y hierbas medicinales que en la tierra se hallan. Hay casas como de boticarios donde se venden las medicinas hechas, así potables como ungüentos y emplastos. Hay casas como de barberos, donde lavan y rapan las cabezas. Hay casas donde dan de comer y beber por precio. Hay hombres como los que llaman en Castilla ganapanes, para traer cargas. Hay mucha leña, carbón, braseros de barro y esteras de muchas maneras para camas, y otras más delgadas para asiento y esterar salas y cámaras. Hay todas las maneras de verduras que se hallan, especialmente cebollas, puerros, ajos, mastierzo, berros, borrajas, acederas y cardos y tagarninas. Hay frutas de muchas maneras, en que hay cerezas, y ciruelas, que son semejantes a las de España. Venden miel de abejas y cera y miel de cañas de maíz, que son tan melosas y dulces como las de azúcar, y miel de unas plantas que llaman en las otras islas maguey, que es mucho mejor que arrope, y de estas plantas hacen azúcar y vino, que asimismo venden. Hay a vender muchas maneras de hilados de algodón de todos colores, en sus madejicas, que parece propiamente alcaicería de Granada en las sedas, aunque esto otro es en mucha más cantidad. Venden colores ara pintores, cuantos se pueden hallar en España, y de tan excelentes matices cuanto pueden ser. Venden cueros de venado con pelo y sin él; teñidos, blancos y de diversas colores. Venden mucha loza en gran manera muy buena, venden muchas vasijas de tinajas grandes y pequeñas, jarros, ollas, ladrillos y otras infinitas maneras de vasijas, todas de singular barro, todas o las más, vidriadas y pintadas.

Venden mucho maíz en grano y en pan, lo cual hace mucha ventaja, así en el grano como en el sabor, a todo lo de las otras islas y tierra firme. Venden pasteles de aves y empanadas de pescado. Venden mucho pescado fresco y salado, crudo y guisado. Venden huevos de gallinas y de ánsares, y de todas las otras aves que he dicho, en gran cantidad; venden tortillas de huevos hechas. Finalmente, que en los dichos mercados se venden todas cuantas cosas se hallan en toda la tierra, que demás de las que he dicho, son tantas y de tantas calidades, que por la prolijidad y por no me ocurrir tantas a la memoria, y aun por no saber poner los nombres, no las expreso. Cada genero de mercaduría se venden en su calle, sin que entremetan otra mercaduría ninguna, y en esto tienen mucha orden. Todo se vende por cuenta y medida, excepto que hasta ahora no se ha visto vender cosa alguna por peso.

Hay en esta gran plaza una gran casa como de audiencia, donde están siempre sentadas diez o doce personas, que son jueces y libran todos los casos y cosas que en el dicho mercado acaecen, y mandan castigar los delincuentes. Hay en la dicha plaza otras personas que andan continuo entre la gente, mirando lo que se vende y las medidas con que miden lo que venden; y se ha visto quebrar alguna que estaba falsa.

Hay en esta gran ciudad muchas mezquitas o casas de sus ídolos de muy hermosos edificios, por las colaciones y barrios de ella, y en las principales de ella hay personas religiosas de su secta, que residen continuamente en ellas, para los cuales, demás de las casas donde tienen los ídolos, hay buenos aposentos. Todos estos religiosos visten de negro y nunca cortan el cabello, ni lo peinan desde que entran en la religión hasta que salen, y todos los hijos de las personas principales, así señores como ciudadanos honrados, están en aquellas religiones y hábito desde edad de siete u ocho años hasta que los sacan para casarlos, y esto más acaece en los primogénitos que han de heredar las casas, que en los otros. No tienen acceso a mujer ni entra ninguna en las dichas casas de religión. Tienen abstinencia en no comer ciertos manjares, y más en algunos tiempos del año que no en los otros; y entre estas mezquitas hay una que es la principal, que no hay lengua humana que sepa explicar la grandeza y particularidades de ella, porque es tan grande que dentro del circuito de ella, que es todo cercado de muro muy alto, se podía muy bien hacer una villa de quinientos vecinos; tiene dentro de este circuito, todo a la redonda, muy gentiles aposentos en que hay muy grande salas y corredores donde se aposentan los religiosos que allí están. Hay bien cuarenta torres muy altas y bien obradas, que la mayor tienen cincuenta escalones para subir al cuerpo de la torre; la más principal es más alta que la torre de la iglesia mayor de Sevilla. Son tan bien labradas, así de cantería como de madera, que no pueden ser mejor hechas ni labradas en ninguna parte, porque toda la cantería de dentro de las capillas donde tienen los ídolos, es de imaginería y zaquizamíes, y el maderamiento es todo de masonería muy pintado de cosas de monstruos y otras figuras y labores. Todas estas torres son enterramiento de señores, y las capillas que en ellas tienen son dedicadas cada una a su ídolo, a que tienen devoción.

Hay tres salas dentro de esta gran mezquita, donde están los principales ídolos, de maravillosa grandeza y altura, y de muchas labores y figuras esculpidas, así en la cantería como en el maderamiento, y dentro de estas salas están otras capillas que las puertas por donde entran a ellas son muy pequeñas, y ellas asimismo no tienen claridad alguna, y allí no están sino aquellos religiosos, y no todos, y dentro e éstas están los bultos y figuras de los ídolos, aunque, como he dicho, de fuera hay también muchos. Los más principales de estos ídolos, y en quien ellos más fe y creencia tenían, derroqué de sus sillas y los hice echar por las escaleras abajo e hice limpiar aquellas capillas donde los tenían, porque todas estaban llenas de sangre que sacrifican, y puse en ellas imágenes de Nuestra Señora y de otros santos que no poco el dicho Mutezuma y los naturales sintieron; los cuales primero me dijeron que no lo hiciese, porque si se sabía por las comunidades se levantaría contra mí, porque tenían que aquellos ídolos les daban todos los bienes temporales, y que dejándolos maltratar, se enojarían y no les darían nada, y les sacarían los frutos de la tierra y moriría la gente de hambre. Yo les hice entender con las lenguas cuán engañados estaban en tener su esperanza en aquellos ídolos, que eran hechos por sus manos, de cosas no limpias, y que habían de saber que había un solo Dios, universal Señor de todos, el cual había criado el cuelo y la tierra y todas las cosas, y que hizo a ellos y a nosotros, y que Este era sin principio e inmortal, y que a El había de adorar y creer y no a otra criatura ni cosa alguna, y les dije todo lo demás que yo en este caso supe, para los desviar de sus idolatrías y atraer al conocimiento de Dios Nuestro Señor; y todos, en especial el dicho Mutezuma, me respondieron que ya me habían dicho que ellos no eran naturales de esta tierra, y que había muchos tiempos que sus predecesores habían venido a ella, y que bien creían que podrían estar errados en algo de aquello que tenían, por haber tanto tiempo que salieron de su naturaleza, y que yo, como más nuevamente venido, sabría las cosas que debían tener y creer mejor que no ellos; que se las dijese e hiciese entender, que ellos harían lo que yo les dijese que era lo mejor. Y el dicho Mutezuma y muchos de los principales de la ciudad dicha, estuvieron conmigo hasta quitar los ídolos y limpiar las capillas y poner las imágenes, y todo con alegre semblante, y les defendí que no matasen criaturas a los ídolos, como acostumbraban, porque, demás de ser muy aborrecible a Dios, vuestra sacra majestad por sus leyes lo prohíbe, y manda que el que matare lo maten. Y de ahí adelante se apartaron de ello, y en todo el tiempo que yo estuve en la dicha ciudad, nunca se vio matar ni sacrificar criatura alguna.

Los bultos y cuerpos de los ídolos en quien estas gentes creen son de muy mayores estaturas que el cuerpo de un hombre. Son hechos de masa de todas las semillas y legumbres que ellos comen, molidas y mezcladas unas con otras, y amásanlas con sangre de corazón de cuerpos humanos, los cuales abren por los pechos, vivos, y les sacan el corazón, y de aquella sangre que sale de él, amasan aquella harina, y así hacen tanta cantidad cuanta basta para hacer aquellas estatuas grandes. Y también, después de hechas, les ofrecían más corazones, que así mismo les sacrificaban, y les untaban las caras con la sangre. Y a cada cosa tienen su ídolo lo dedicado, al uso de los gentiles, que antiguamente honraban a sus dioses. Por manera que para pedir favor para la guerra tienen un ídolo, y para sus labranzas otro, y así para cada cosa de las que ellos quieren o desean que se hagan bien, tienen sus ídolos a quien honran y sirven.

Hay en esta gran ciudad muchas casas muy buenas y muy grandes, y la causa de haber tantas casas principales es que todos los señores de la tierra, vasallos del dicho Mutezuma, tienen sus casas en la dicha ciudad y residen en ella cierto tiempo del año, y demás de esto hay en ella muchos ciudadanos ricos que tienen así mismo muy buenas casas. Todos ellos, demás de tener muy grandes y buenos aposentamientos, tienen muy gentiles vergeles de flores de diversas maneras, así en los aposentamientos altos como bajos. Por la una calzada que a esta gran ciudad entra vienen dos caños de argamasa, tan anchos como dos pasos cada uno, y tan altos como un estado, y por el uno de ellos viene un golpe de agua dulce muy buena, del gordor de un cuerpo de hombre, que va a dar al cuerpo de la ciudad, de que se sirven y beben todos. El otro, que va vacío, es para cuando quieren limpiar el otro caño, porque echan por allí el agua en tanto que se limpia; y porque el agua ha de pasar por los puentes a causa de las quebradas por donde atraviesa el agua salada, echan la dulce por unas canales tan gruesas como un buey, que son de la longua de las dichas puentes, y así se sirve toda la ciudad.

Traen a vender el agua por canoas por todas las calles, y la manera de como la toman del caño es que llegan las canoas debajo de los puentes, por donde están las canales, y de allí hay hombre en lo alto que hinchen las canoas, y les pagan por ello su trabajo. En todas las entradas de la ciudad, y en las partes donde descargan las canoas, que es donde viene la más cantidad de los mantenimientos que entran en la ciudad, hay chozas hechas donde están personas por guardas y que reciben certum quid de cada cosa que entra. Esto no sé si lo lleva el señor o si es propio para la ciudad, porque hasta ahora no lo he alcanzado; pero creo que para el señor, porque en otros mercados de otras provincias se ha visto coger aquel derecho para el señor de ellas. Hay en todos los mercados y lugares públicos de la dicha ciudad, todos los días, muchas personas, trabajadores y maestros de todos oficios, esperando quien los alquile por sus jornales.

La gente de esta ciudad es de más manera y primor en su vestir y servicio que no la otra de estas otras provincias y ciudades, porque como allí estaba siempre este señor Mutezuma, y todos los señores sus vasallos ocurrían siempre a la ciudad, había en ella más manera y policía en todas las cosas. Y por no ser más prolijo en la relación de las cosas de esta gran ciudad, aunque no acabaría tan aína, no quiero decir más sino que en su servicio y trato de la gente de ella hay la manera casi de vivir que en España; y con tanto concierto y orden como allá, y que considerando esta gente ser bárbara y tan apartada del conocimiento de Dios y de la comunicación de otras naciones de razón, es cosa admirable ver la que tienen en todas las cosas.

En lo del servicio de Mutezuma y de las cosas de admiración que tenía por grandeza y estado, ay tanto que escribir que certifico a vuestra alteza que yo no sé por donde comenzar, que pueda acabar de decir alguna parte de ellas; porque, como ya he dicho ¿qué más grandeza puede ser que un señor bárbaro como éste tuviese contrahechas de oro y plata y piedras y plumas, todas las cosas que debajo del cielo hay en su señorío, tan al natural lo de oro y plata, que no hay platero en el mundo que mejor lo hiciese, y lo de las piedras que no baste juicio comprender con qué instrumentos se hiciese tan perfecto, y lo de pluma, que ni de cera ni en ningún bordado se podría hacer tan maravillosamente? El señorío de tierras que este Mutezuma tenía no se ha podido alcanzar cuánto era, porque a ninguna parte, doscientas leguas de un cabo y de otro de aquella su gran ciudad, enviaba sus mensajeros, que no fuese cumplido su mandado, aunque había algunas provincias en medio de estas tierras con quien él tenía guerra. Pero por lo que se alcanzó, y yo de él pude comprender, era su señorío tanto casi como España, porque hasta sesenta leguas de esta parte de Putunchán, que es el río de Grijalva, envió mensajeros a que se diesen por vasallos de vuestra majestad los naturales de una ciudad que se dice Cumatán, que había desde la gran ciudad a ella doscientas y veinte leguas; porque las ciento y cincuenta yo he hecho andar y ver a los.españoles. Todos los más de los señores de estas tierras y provincias, en especial los comarcanos, residían, como ya he dicho, mucho tiempo del año en aquella gran ciudad, y todos o los más tenían sus hijos primogenitos en el servicio del dicho Mutezuma.

En todos los señoríos de estos señores tenía fuerzas hechas, y en ellas gente suya, y sus gobernadores y cogedores del servicio y renta que de cada provincia le daban, y había cuenta y razón de lo que cada uno era obligado a dar, porque tienen caracteres y figuras escritas en el papel que hacen por donde se entienden. Cada una de estas provincias servían con su género de servicio, según la calidad de la tierra, por manera que a su poder venía toda suerte de cosas que en las dichas provincias había. Era tan temido de todos, así presentes como ausentes, que nunca príncipe del mundo lo fue más. Tenía, así fuera de la ciudad como dentro, muchas casas de placer, y cada una de su manera de pasatiempo, tan bien labradas como se podría decir, y cuales requerían ser para un gran príncipe y señor. Tenía dentro de la ciudad sus casas de aposentamiento, tales y tan maravillosas que me parecía casi imposible poder decir la bondad y grandeza de ellas, y por tanto no me pondré en expresar cosa de ellas más de que en España no hay su semejable.

Tenía una casa poco menos buena que ésta, donde tenía un muy hermoso jardín con ciertos miradores que salían sobre él, y los mármoles y losas de ellos eran de jaspe muy bien obradas. Había en esta casa aposentamientos para se aposentar dos muy grandes príncipes con todo su servicio. En esta casa tenía diez estanques de agua, donde tenía todos los linajes de aves de agua que en estas partes se hallan, que son muchos y diversos, todas domésticas; y para las aves que se crían en la mar, eran los estanques de agua salada, y para los de ríos, lagunas de agua dulce, la cual agua vaciaban de cierto a cierto tiempo, por la limpieza, y la tornaban a henchir por sus caños, y a cada género de aves se daba aquel mantenimiento que era propio a su natural y con que ellas en el campo se mantenían. De forma que a las que comían pescado, se lo daban; y las que gusanos, gusanos; y a las que maíz, maíz; y las que otras semillas más menudas, por el consiguiente se las daban. Y certifico a vuestra alteza que a las aves que solamente comían pescado se les daba cada día diez arrobas de él, que se toma en la laguna saladas. Había para tener cargo de más aves trescientos hombres, que en ninguna otra cosa entendían. Había otros hombres que solamente entendían en curar las aves que adolecían. Sobre cada alberca y estanque de estas aves había sus corredores y miradores muy gentilmente labrados, donde el dicho Mutezuma se venía a recrear y a las ver. Tenía en esta casa un cuarto en que tenía hombres y mujeres y niños blancos de su nacimiento en el rostro y cuerpo y cabellos y cejas y pestañas. Tenía otra casa muy hermosa donde tenía un gran patio losado de muy gentiles losas, todo él hecho a manera de un juego de ajedrez, y las casas eran hondas cuanto estado y medio, y tan grandes como seis pasos en cuadra; y la mitad de cada una de estas casas era cubierta el soterrado de losas, y la mitad que quedaba por cubrir tenía encima una red de palo muy bien hecha; y en cada una de estas casas había un ave de rapiña; comenzando de cernícalo hasta águila, todas cuantas se hallan en España, y muchas más raleas que allá no se han visto. Y de cada una de estas raleas había mucha cantidad y en lo cubierto de cada una de estas casas había un palo como alcandra y otro fuera debajo de la red, que en el uno estaban de noche y cuando llovía y en el otro se podían salir al sol y al aire a curarse. Y a todas estas aves daban todos los días de comer gallinas y no otro mantenimiento. Había en esta casa ciertas salas grandes bajas, todas llenas de jaulas grandes de muy gruesos maderos muy bien labrados y encajados y en todas o en las más había leones, tigres, lobos, zorras y gatos de diversas maneras y de todos en cantidad, a los cuales daban de comer gallinas cuantas les bastaban. Y para esos animales y aves había otros trescientos hombres que tenían cargo de ellos.

Tenía otra casa donde tenía muchos hombres y mujeres monstruos, en que había enanos, corcovados y contrahechos y otros con otras disformidades y cada una manera de monstruos en su cuarto por sí y también había para éstos, personas dedicadas para tener cargo de ellos, y las otras cosas de placer que tenía en su ciudad dejo de decir, por ser muchas y de muchas calidades.

La manera de su servicio era que todos los días, luego en amaneciendo, eran en su casa más de seiscientos señores y personas principales, los cuales se sentaban y otros andaban por unas salas y corredores que había en la dicha casa y allí estaban hablando y pasando tiempo sin entrar donde su persona estaba. Y los servidores de éstos y personas de quien se acompañaban henchían dos o tres grandes patios y la calle, que era muy grande. Y todos estaban sin salir de allí todo el día hasta la noche. Y al tiempo que traían de comer al dicho Mutezuma, así mismo lo traían a todos aquellos señores tan cumplidamente cuanto a su persona y también a los servidores y gentes de éstos les daban sus raciones. Había cotidianamente la despensa y botillería abierta para todos aquellos que quisiesen comer y beber. La manera de como le daban de comer, es que venían trescientos o cuatrocientos mancebos con el manjar, que era sin cuento, porque todas las veces que comía , y le traían de todas las maneras de manjares, así de carnes como de pescados, frutas y yerbas que en toda la tierra se podían haber. Y porque la tierra es fría, traían debajo de cada plato y escudilla de manjar un braserico con brasa para que no se enfriase. Poníanle todos los manjares juntos en una gran sala en que él comía, que casi toda se henchía, la cual estaba toda muy bien esterada y muy limpia y él estaba sentado en una almohada de cuero, pequeña, muy bien hecha. Al tiempo que comía, estaban allí desviados de él cinco o seis señores ancianos, a los cuales él daba de lo que comía y estaba en pie uno de aquellos servidores, que le ponía y alzaba los manjares y pedía a los otros que estaban más afuera lo que era necesario para el servicio. Y al principio y fin de la comida y cena, siempre le daban agua a manos y con la toalla que una vez se limpiaba nunca se limpiaba más, ni tampoco los platos y escudillas en que le traían una vez el manjar se los tornaban a traer, sino siempre nuevos y así hacían de los brasericos.

Vestíase todos los días cuatro maneras de vestiduras, todas nuevas y nunca más se las vestía otra vez. Todos los señores que entraban en su casa no entraban calzados y cuando iban delante de él algunos que él enviaba a llamar, llevaban la cabeza y ojos inclinados y el cuerpo muy humillado y hablando con él no le miraban a la cara, lo cual hacían por mucho acatamiento y reverencia. Y sé que lo hacían por este respecto, porque ciertos señores reprendían a los españoles diciendo que cuando hablaban conmigo estaban exentos, mirándome la cara, que parecía desacatamiento y poca vergüenza. Cuando salía fuera el dicho Mutezuma, que era pocas veces, todos los que iban con él y los que topaba por las calles le volvían el rostro y en ninguna manera le miraban y todos los demás se postraban hasta que él pasaba. Llevaba siempre delante de sí un señor de aquellos con tres varas delgadas altas, que creo se hacía porque se supiese que iba allí su persona. Y cuando lo descendían de las anchas tomaban la una en la mano y llevábanla hasta donde iba.

Eran tantas y tan diversas las maneras y ceremonias que este señor tenía en su servicio, que era necesario mas espacio del que yo al presente tengo para relatarlas y aun mejor memoria para retenerlas, porque ninguno de los soldanes ni otro ningún señor infiel de los que hasta ahora se tiene noticia, no creo que tantas ni tales ceremonias en su servicio tengan.

En esta gran ciudad estuve proveyendo las cosas que parecía que convenía al servicio de vuestra sacra majestad y pacificando y atrayendo a él muchas provincias y tierras pobladas de muchas y muy grandes ciudades, villas y fortalezas y descubriendo minas y sabiendo e inquiriendo muchos secretos de las tierras del señorío de este Mutezuma como de otras que con él confinaban y él tenía noticia; que son tantas y tan maravillosas, que son casi increíbles y todo con tanta voluntad y contentamiento del dicho Mutezuma y de todos los naturales de las dichas tierras, como si de ab initio hubieran conocido a vuestra sacra majestad por su rey y señor natural y no con menos voluntad hacían todas las cosas que en su real nombre les mandaba.

En las cuales dichas cosas y en otras no menos útiles al servicio de vuestra alteza, gasté de 8 de noviembre de 1519, hasta entrante el mes de mayo de este año presente, que estando en toda quietud y sosiego en esta dicha ciudad, teniendo repartidos muchos de los españoles por muchas y diversas partes, pacificando y poblando esta tierra, con mucho deseo que viniesen navíos con la respuesta de la relación que a vuestra majestad habían hecho de esta tierra, para con ellos enviar las que ahora envío y todas las cosas de oro y joyas que en ella había habido para vuestra alteza, vinieron a mí ciertos naturales de esta tierra, vasallos del dicho Mutezuma, de los que en la costa del mar moran y me dijeron cómo junto a las sierras de San Martín, que son junto en la dicha costa, antes del puerto o bahía de San Juan, habían llegado dieciocho navíos y que no sabían quién eran, porque así como los vieron en la mar me lo vinieron a hacer saber. Y tras de estos dichos indios vino otro natural de la isla Fernandina, el cual me trajo una carta de un español que yo tenía puesto en la costa para que si navíos viniesen, les diese razón de mí y de aquella villa que allí estaba cerca de aquel puerto, porque no se perdiesen. En la cual dicha carta se contenía que ""en tal día había asomado un navío, frontero del dicho puerto de San Juan, solo y que había mirado por toda la costa de la mar cuanto su vista podía comprender y que no había visto otro y que creía que era la nao que yo había enviado a vuestra sacra majestad, por que ya era tiempo que viniese y que para más certificarse, él quedaba esperando que la dicha nao llegase al puerto para informarse de ella y que luego venía a traerme la relación"".

Vista esta carta, despaché dos españoles, uno por un camino y otro por otro, porque no errasen a algún mensajero si de la nao viniese. A los cuales dije llegasen hasta el dicho puerto y supiesen cuántos navíos eran llegados y de dónde eran y lo que traían y se volviesen a la más prisa que fuese posible a hacérmelo saber. Y así mismo despaché otro a la Villa de la Veracruz a decirles lo que de aquellos navíos había sabido, para que de allá mismo se informasen y me lo hiciesen saber y otro al capitán que con los ciento cincuenta hombres enviaba a hacer el pueblo de la provincia y puerto de Quacucalco; al cual escribí que doquiera que el dicho mensajero le alcanzase, se estuviese y no pasase adelante hasta que yo segunda vez le escribiese, porque tenía nueva que eran llegados al puerto ciertos navíos; el cual, según después pareció, ya cuando llegó mi carta sabía de la venida de los dichos navíos y enviados estos dichos mensajeros, se pasaron quince días que ninguna cosa supe, ni hube respuesta de ninguno de ellos; de que no estaba poco espantado. Y pasados estos quince días, vinieron así mismo otros indios vasallos del dicho Mutezuma, de los cuales supe que los dichos navíos estaban ya surtos en el dicho puerto de San Juan y la gente desembarcada y traían por copia, que había ochenta caballos y ochocientos hombres y diez o doce tiros de fuego, lo cual todo lo traía figurado en un papel de la tierra, para mostrarlo al dicho Mutezuma. Y dijéronme cómo el español que yo tenía puesto en la costa y los otros mensajeros que yo había enviado, estaban con la dicha gente y que les habían dicho a estos indios que el capitán de aquella gente no los dejaba venir y que me lo dijesen.

Y sabido esto, acordé de enviar un religioso que yo traje en mi compañía, con una carta mía y otra de alcaldes y regidores de la Villa de la Vera Cruz, que estaban conmigo en la dicha ciudad. Las cuales iban dirigidas al capitán y gente que a aquel puerto había llegado, haciéndole saber muy por extenso lo que en esta tierra me había sucedido y cómo tenía muchas ciudades, villas y fortalezas ganadas, conquistadas, pacíficas y sujetas al real servicio de vuestra majestad y preso, al señor principal de todas estas partes y cómo estaba en aquella gran ciudad y la cualidad de ella, el oro y joyas que para vuestra alteza tenía. Y cómo había enviado relación de esta tierra a vuestra majestad y que les pedía por merced me hiciesen saber quienes eran y si eran vasallos naturales de los reinos y señoríos de vuestra alteza, me escribiesen si venían a esta tierra por su real mandado o a poblar y estar en ella o si pasaban adelante o habían de volver atrás, o si traían alguna necesidad, que yo les haría proveer de todo lo que a mí posible fuese y que si eran de fuera de los reinos de vuestra alteza, así mismo me hiciesen saber si traían alguna necesidad, porque también lo remediarla pudiendo. Donde no, le requería de parte de vuestra majestad que luego se fuesen de sus tierras y no saltasen en ellas, con apercibimiento que si así no lo hiciesen, iría contra ellos y con todo el poder que yo tuviese, así de españoles como de naturales de la tierra y los prendería y mataría como extranjeros que se querían entremeter en los reinos y señoríos de mi rey y señor.

Y partido el dicho religioso con el dicho despacho, dende en cinco días llegaron a la ciudad de Temixtitan veinte españoles de los que en la Villa de la Vera Cruz tenía; los cuales me traían un clérigo y otros dos legos que habían tomado de la dicha villa; de los cuales supe cómo el armada y gente que en el dicho puerto estaba, era de Diego Velázquez, que venía por capitán de ella un Pánfilo de Narváez, vecino de la isla Fernandina. Y que traían ochenta de a caballo y muchos tiros de pólvora y ochocientos peones; entre los cuales dijeron que había ochenta escopeteros y ciento veinte ballesteros y que venía y se nombraba por capitán general y teniendo de gobernador de todas estas partes, por el dicho Diego Velázquez. Y que para ella traía provisiones de vuestra majestad y que los mensajeros que yo había enviado y el hombre que en la costa tenía, estaban con el dicho Pánfilo de Narváez y no les dejaban venir. El cual se había informado de ellos de cómo yo tenía poblada allí aquella villa, doce leguas del dicho puerto y de la gente que en ella estaba y así mismo de la gente que yo enviaba a Quacucalco y cómo estaban en una provincia, treinta leguas del dicho puerto, que se dice Tuchitebeque y de todas las cosas que yo en la tierra había hecho en servicio de vuestra alteza y las ciudades y villas que yo tenía conquistadas y pacíficas y de aquella gran ciudad de Temixtitan y del oro y joyas que en la tierra se había habido; y se había informado de ellos de todas las otras cosas que me habían enviado el dicho Narváez a la dicha Villa de la Vera Cruz a que si pudiesen, hablasen de su parte a los que en ella estaban y los atrajesen a su pro osito y se levantasen contra mí. Y con ellos me trajeron más de cien cartas que el dicho Narváez y los que con él estaban enviaban a los de la dicha villa, diciendo que diesen crédito a lo que aquel clérigo y los otros que iban con él, de su parte les dijesen y prometiéndoles que si así lo hiciesen, que por parte del dicho Diego Velázquez y de él en su nombre les serían hechas muchas mercedes y los que lo contrario hiciesen, habían de ser muy maltratados y otras muchas cosas que en las dichas cartas se contenían y el dicho clérigo y los que con él venían dijeron. Y casi junto con éstos vino un español de los que iban a Quacucalco con cartas del capitán, que era un Juan Velázquez de León, el cual me hacía saber cómo la gente que había llegado al puerto era Pánfilo de Narváez, que venía en nombre de Diego Velázquez, con la gente que traían y me envió una carta que el dicho Narváez le había enviado con un indio, como a pariente del dicho Diego Velázquez y cuñado del dicho Narváez, en que por ella le decía cómo de aquellos mensajeros míos había sabido que estaba allí con aquella gente; que luego se fuese con ella a él, porque en ello haría lo que cumplía y lo que era obligado a sus deudos y que bien creía que yo le tenía por la fuerza y otras cosas que el dicho Narváez le escribía.

El cual dicho capitán, como más obligado al servicio de vuestra majestad, no sólo dejó de aceptar lo que el dicho Narváez por su letra le decía, más aún luego se partió después de haberme enviado la carta, para venirse a juntar conmigo con toda la gente que tenía. Y después de haberme informado de aquel clérigo y de otros dos que con él venían, de muchas cosas y de la intención de los del dicho Diego Velázquez y Narváez y de cómo se habían movido con aquella armada y gente contra mí, porque yo había enviado la relación y cosas de esta tierra a vuestra majestad y no al dicho Diego Velázquez. Y cómo venía con dañada voluntad para matarme a mí y a muchos de mi compañía que ya desde allá traían señalados y supe así mismo cómo Figueroa, juez de residencia en la isla Española y los jueces y oficiales de vuestra alteza que en ella residen, sabido por ellos cómo el dicho Diego Velázquez hacía la dicha armada y la voluntad con que la hacía, constándoles el daño y deservicio que de su venida a vuestra majestad podía redundar, enviaron al licenciado Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón, uno de los dichos jueces, con su poder, a requerir y mandar al dicho Diego Velázquez no enviase la dicha armada; el cual vino y halló al dicho Velázquez con toda la gente armada en la punta de la dicha isla Fernandina, ya que quería pasar y que allí le requirió a él y a todos los que en la dicha armada venían, que no viniesen porque de ello vuestra alteza era muy deservido. Y sobre ello les impuso muchas penas, las cuales no obstante ni todo lo por el dicho licenciado requerido ni mandado, todavía había enviado la dicha armada y que el dicho licenciado Ayllón estaba en el dicho puerto que había venido juntamente con ella, pensando de evitar el daño que de la venida de la dicha armada se seguía. Porque a él y a todos era notorio el mal propósito y la voluntad con que la dicha armada venía.

Envié al dicho clérigo con una carta mía para el dicho Narváez, por la cual le decía cómo yo había sabido del dicho clérigo y de los que con él habían venido, cómo él era capitán de la gente de aquella armada y que holgaba que fuese él, porque tenla otro pensamiento viendo que los mensajeros que yo había enviado no venían; pero que pues él sabía que yo estaba en esta tierra en servicio de vuestra alteza, me maravillaba no me escribiese o enviase mensajero, haciéndome saber de su venida, pues sabía que yo había de holgar con ella, así por él ser mi amigo de mucho tiempo había, como porque creía que él venía a servir a vuestra alteza, que era lo que yo más deseaba y enviar, como había enviado, sobornadores y cartas de inducimiento a las personas que yo tenía en mi compañía en servicio de vuestra majestad, para que se levantasen contra mí y se pasasen a él, como si fuéramos los unos infieles y los otros cristianos o los unos vasallos de vuestra alteza y los otros sus deservidores. Y que le pedía por merced que de allí adelante no tuviese aquellas formas, antes me hiciese saber la causa de su venida y que me habían dicho que se intitulaba capitán general y teniente de gobernador por Diego Velázquez y por tal se había hecho pregonar en la tierra y que había hecho alcaldes y regidores y ejecutado justicia, lo cual era en mucho deservicio de vuestra alteza y contra todas sus leyes. Porque siendo esta tierra de vuestra majestad y estando poblada de sus vasallos y habiendo en ella justicia y cabildo, que no se debía intitular de los dichos oficios, ni usar de ellos sin ser primero a ellos recibido; puesto que para ejercerlos trajese provisiones de vuestra majestad, las cuales si traía, le pedía por merced y le requería las presentase ante mí y ante el cabildo de la Vera Cruz y que de él y de mí serían obedecidas como cartas y provisiones de nuestro rey y senor natural y cumplidas en cuanto al real servicio de vuestra majestad conviniese. Porque yo estaba en aquella ciudad y en ella tenía preso a aquel señor y tenía mucha suma de oro y joyas, así de lo de vuestra alteza como de los de mi compañía y mío; lo cual yo no osaba dejar, con temor que salido yo de la dicha ciudad la gente se rebelase y perdiese tanta cantidad de oro y joyas y tal ciudad, mayormente que perdida aquélla, era perdida toda la tierra. Y así mismo di al dicho clérigo una carta para el dicho licenciado Ayllón, el cual, según supe yo después al tiempo que el dicho clérigo llegó, había prendido el dicho Narváez y enviado preso con dos navíos.

El día que el dicho clérigo se partió, me llegó un mensajero de los que estaban en la villa de la Vera Cruz, por el cual me hacían saber que toda la gente de los naturales de la tierra estaban levantados y hechos con el dicho Narváez, en especial los de la ciudad de Cempoal y su partido. Y que ninguno de ellos quería venir a servir a la dicha villa, así en la fortaleza como en las otras cosas en que solían servir. Porque decían que Narváez les había dicho que yo era malo y que me venía a prender a mí y a todos los de mi compañía y levarnos presos y dejar la tierra. Y que la gente que el dicho Narváez traía era mucha y la que yo tenía poca. Y que él traía muchos caballos y muchos tiros y que yo tenia pocos y que querían ser a viva quien vence, y que también me hacían saber que eran informados de los dichos indios, que el dicho Narváez se venía a aposentar en la dicha ciudad de Cempoal y que ya sabía cuán cerca estaba de aquella villa. Y que creían, según eran informados, del mal propósito que el dicho Narváez contra todos traía, que desde allí venía sobre ellos y teniendo de su parte los indios de la dicha ciudad. Y por tanto, me hacían saber que ellos dejaban la villa sola por no pelear con ellos y por evitar escándalo se subían a la sierra a casa de un señor vasallo de vuestra alteza y amigo nuestro y que allí pensaban estar hasta que yo les enviase a mandar lo que hiciesen.

Y como yo vi el gran daño que se comenzaba a revolver y cómo la tierra se levantaba a causa del dicho Narváez, parecióme que con ir yo donde él estaba apaciguándose mucho, porque viéndome los indios presente, no se osarían a levantar y también porque pensaba dar orden con el dicho Narváez, cómo tan gran mal como se comenzaba, cesase. Y así me partí aquel mismo día; dejando la fortaleza muy bien bastecida de maíz y de agua y quinientos hombres dentro en ella y algunos tiros de pólvora. Y con la otra gente que allí tenía, que serían hasta setenta hombres, seguí mi camino con algunas personas principales de los del dicho Mutezuma. Al cual yo, antes que me partiese, hice muchos razonamientos, diciéndole que mirase que él era vasallo de vuestra majestad y que ahora había de recibir mercedes de vuestra majestad por los servicios que le habían hecho. Y que aquellos españoles le dejaba encomendados Con todo aquel oro y joyas que él me había dado y mandado dar para vuestra alteza; porque yo iba a aquella gente que allí había venido, a saber que gente era, porque hasta entonces no lo había sabido y creía que debía ser alguna mala gente y no vasallos de vuestra alteza. Y él me prometió de hacerlos proveer de todo lo necesario y guardar mucho todo lo que allí le dejaba puesto para vuestra majestad y que aquellos suyos que iban conmigo me llevarían por camino que no saliese de su tierra y me harían proveer en él de todo lo que hubiese menester y que me rogaba, si aquella fuese gente mala, que se lo hiciese saber, porque luego proveería de mucha gente de guerra para que fuese a pelear con ellos y echarlos fuera de la tierra. Lo cual yo le agradecí y certifiqué que por ello vuestra alteza le mandaría hacer muchas joyas y ropas a él y a un hijo suyo y a muchos señores que estaban con él a la sazón.

Y en una ciudad que se dice Chururtecal topé a Juan Velázquez, capitán, que como he dicho, enviaba a Quacucalco, que con toda la gente se venía. Y sacados algunos que venían mal dispuestos, que envié a la ciudad con él y con los demás, seguí mi camino. Y quince leguas adelante de esta ciudad de Chururtecal, topé a aquel padre religioso de mi compañía, que yo había enviado al puerto a saber qué gente era la de la armada que allí había venido. El cual me trajo una carta del dicho Narváez, en que me decía que él traía ciertas provisiones para tener esta tierra por Diego Velázquez. Que luego fuese donde él estaba a obedecerlas y cumplir y que él tenía hecha una villa, alcaldes y regidores. Y del dicho religioso supe cómo habían prendido al dicho licenciado Ayllón y a su escribano y alguacil y los habían enviado en dos navíos. Y cómo allá le habían acometido con partidos para que el atrajese algunos de los de mi compañía y se pasasen al dicho Narváez y cómo habían hecho alarde delante de él y de ciertos indios que con él iban, de toda la gente, así de pie como de caballo y soltado él artillería que estaba en los navíos y la que tenían en tierra, a fin de atemorizar, porque le dijeron al dicho religioso: ""Mirad cómo os podéis defender de nosotros si no hacéis lo que quisiéremos"". Y también me dijo cómo había hallado con el dicho Narváez a un señor natural de esta tierra, vasallo del dicho Mutezuma y que le tenía por gobernador suyo en toda su tierra, de los puertos hacia la costa de la mar y que supo que al dicho Narváez, le había hablado de parte del dicho Mutezuma y dádole ciertas joyas de oro y el dicho Narváez le había dado también a él ciertas cosillas. Y que supo que había despachado de allí ciertos mensajeros para el dicho Mutezuma y enviado a decirle que él le soltaría y que venía a prenderme a mí y a todos los de mi compañía e irse luego y dejar la tierra. Y que él no quería oro, sino, preso yo y los que conmigo estaban, volverse y dejar la tierra y sus naturales de ella en su libertad. Finalmente que supe que su intención era de aposesionarse en la tierra, por su autoridad, sin pedir que fuese recibido de ninguna persona y no queriendo yo ni los de mi compañía tenerle por capitán y justicia, en nombre del dicho Diego Velázquez, venía contra nosotros a tomarnos por guerra y que para ello estaba confederado con los naturales de la tierra, en especial con el dicho Mutezuma, por sus mensajeros. Y como yo viese tan manifiesto el daño y deservicio que a vuestra majestad de lo susodicho se podía seguir, puesto que me dijeron el gran poder que traía y aunque traía mandado de Diego Velázquez que a mí y a ciertos de los de mi compañía que venían señalados, que luego que nos pudiese haber nos ahorcase, no dejé de acercarme más a él, creyendo por bien hacerle conocer el gran deservicio que a vuestra alteza hacía y poderle apartar del mal propósito y dañada voluntad que traía y así seguí mi camino.

A quince leguas antes de llegar a la ciudad de Cempoal, donde el dicho Narváez estaba aposentado, llegaron a mí el clérigo de ellos, que los de la Vera Cruz habían enviado y con quien yo al dicho Narváez y al licenciado Ayllón había escrito y otro clérigo y un Andrés de Duero, vecino de la isla Fernandina, que así mismo vino con el dicho Narváez. Los cuales en respuesta de mi carta, me dijeron de parte del dicho Narváez que yo todavía le fuese a obedecer y tener por capitán y le entregase la tierra. Porque de otra manera me sería hecho mucho daño, porque el dicho Narváez traía gran poder y yo tenía poco y demás de la mucha gente de españoles que traía, que los más de los naturales eran en su favor y que si yo le quisiese dar la tierra, que me daría de los navíos y mantenimientos que él traía, los que yo quisiese y me dejaría ir en ellos a mí y a los que conmigo quisiesen ir, con todo lo que quisiésemos llevar, sin ponernos impedimento en cosa alguna.

Y el uno de los dichos clérigos me dijo que así venía capitulado del dicho Diego Velázquez, que hiciesen conmigo el dicho partido y para ello había dado su poder al dicho Narváez y a los dichos dos clérigos juntamente. Y que acerca de esto me harían todo el partido que yo quisiese.

Yo les respondí que no veía provisión de vuestra alteza por donde le debiese entregar la tierra y que si alguna traía que la presentase ante mí y ante el cabildo de la Villa de la Vera Cruz, según orden y costumbre de España. Y que yo estaba presto de obedecerla y cumplir y que hasta tanto, por ningún interés ni partido haría lo que él decía; antes yo y los que conmigo estaban moriríamos en defensa de la tierra, pues la habíamos ganado y tenido por vuestra majestad pacífica y segura y por no ser traidores y desleales a nuestro rey.

Y otros muchos partidos me movieron por atreverme a su propósito y ninguno quise aceptar sin ver provisión de vuestra alteza por donde lo debiese hacer; la cual nunca me quisieron mostrar y en conclusión, estos clérigos y el dicho Andrés de Duero y yo, quedamos concertados que el dicho Narváez con diez personas y yo con otras tantas, nos viésemos con seguridad de ambas las partes y que allí me notificase las provisiones, si algunas traía y que yo respondiese. Y yo de mi parte envié firmado el seguro y él así mismo me envió otro firmado de su nombre, el cual, según me pareció, no tenía pensamiento de guardar, antes concertó que en la visita se tuviese forma como de presto se matasen y para ello se señalaron dos de los diez que con él habían de venir y que los demás peleasen con los que conmigo habían de ir. Porque decían que muerto yo, era su hecho acabado como de verdad lo fuera, si Dios, que en semejantes casos remedia, no remediara con cierto aviso que de los mismos que eran en la traición, me vino, juntamente con el seguro que me enviaban, lo cual sabido, escribí una carta al dicho Narváez y otra a los Terceros, diciéndoles cómo yo había sabido su mala intención y que yo no quería ir de aquella manera que ellos tenían concertado.

Y luego les envié ciertos requerimientos y mandamientos, por el cual requería al dicho Narváez que si algunas provisiones de vuestra alteza traía, me las notificase y que hasta tanto, no se nombrase capitán ni justicia ni se entremetiese en cosa alguna de los dichos oficios, so cierta pena que para ello le impuse. Y así mismo mandaba y mandé por el dicho mandamiento a todas las personas que con el dicho Narváez estaban, que no tuviesen ni obedeciesen al dicho Narváez por tal capitán ni justicia; antes, dentro de cierto término que en el dicho mandamiento señalé, pareciesen ante mí para que yo les dijese lo que debían hacer en servicio de vuestra alteza, con protestación que, lo contrario haciendo, procedería contra ellos como contra traidores, aleves y malos vasallos, que se rebelaban contra su rey y quieren usurpar sus tierras y señoríos y darlas y aposesionar de ellas a quien no pertenecían, ni de ellos ha acción ni derecho compete. Y que para la ejecución de esto, no pareciendo ante mí ni haciendo lo contenido en el dicho mi mandamiento, iría contra ellos a prenderlos y cautivar, conforme a justicia. Y la respuesta que de esto hube del dicho Narváez, fue prender al escribano y a la persona que con mi poder le fueron a notificar el dicho mandamiento y tomarles ciertos indios que llevaban, los cuales estuvieron detenidos hasta que llegó otro mensajero que yo envié a saber de ellos, ante los cuales tornaron a hacer alarde de toda la gente y amenazar a ellos y a mí, si la tierra no les entregásemos. Y visto que por ninguna vía yo podía excusar tan gran daño y mal y que la gente naturales de la tierra se alborotaban y levantaban a más andar, encomendándome a Dios y pospuesto todo el temor del daño que se me podía seguir, considerando que morir en servicio de mi rey y por defender y amparar sus tierras y no dejarlas usurpar, a mí y a los de mi compañía se nos seguía harta gloria, di mi mandamiento a Gonzalo de Sandoval, alguacil mayor, para prender al dicho Narváez y a los que se llamaban alcaldes y regidores; al cual di ochenta hombres y les mandé que fuesen con él a prenderlos y yo con otros ciento setenta, que por todos éramos doscientos cincuenta hombres, sin tiro de pólvora ni caballo, sino a pie, seguí al dicho alguacil mayor, para ayudarlo si el dicho Narváez y los otros quisiesen resistir su prisión.

Y el día que el dicho alguacil mayor y yo con la gente llegamos a la ciudad de Cempoal, donde el dicho Narváez y gente estaba aposentada, luego que supo de nuestra ida, salió al campo con ochenta de caballo y quinientos peones, sin los demás que dejó en su aposento, que era la mezquita mayor de aquella ciudad, asaz fuerte y llegó casi una legua de donde yo estaba y como lo que de mi ida sabía era por lengua de los indios y no me halló, creyó que le burlaban y volvióse a su aposento teniendo apercibida toda su gente y puso dos espías casi a una legua de la dicha ciudad. Y como yo deseaba evitar todo escándalo, parecióme que sería el menos yo ir de noche, sin ser sentido si fuese posible e ir derecho al aposento del dicho Narváez, que yo todos los de mi compañía sabíamos muy bien y prenderlo. Porque preso él, creí que no hubiera escándalo, porque los demás querían obedecer a la justicia, en especial que los demás de ellos venían por fuerza, que el dicho Diego Velázquez les hizo y por temor que no les quitase los indios que en la isla Fernandina tenían.

Y así fue que el día de Pascua de Espíritu Santo, poco más de medianoche, yo di en el dicho aposento y antes topé las dichas espías, que el dicho Narváez tenía puestas y las que yo delante llevaba prendieron a la una de ellas y la otra se escapo, de quien me informé de la manera que estaban y porque la espía que se había escapado no llegase antes que yo y diese mandado de mi venida, me di la mayor prisa que pude, aunque no pude tanta que la dicha espía no llegase primero casi media hora. Cuando llegué al dicho Narváez, ya todos los de su compañía estaban armados ensillados sus caballos y muy a punto y llevaba cada cuarto doscientos hombres. Y llegamos tan sin ruido, que cuando fuimos sentidos y ellos tocaron alarma, entraba yo por el patio de su aposento, en el cual estaba toda la gente aposentada y junta y tenían tomadas tres o cuatro torres que en él había y todos los demás aposentos fuertes. Y en la una de las dichas torres, donde el dicho Narváez estaba aposentado, tenía a la escalera de ella hasta diecinueve tiros de fusilería y dimos tanta prisa a subir la dicha torre, que no tuvieron lugar de poner fuego más de a un tiro, el cual quiso Dios que no salió ni hizo daño ninguno. Así se subió la torre hasta donde el dicho Narváez tenía su cama, donde él y hasta cincuenta hombres que con él estaban pelearon con el dicho alguacil mayor y con los que con él subieron y puesto que muchas veces le requirieron que se diese a prisión por vuestra alteza, nunca quisieron, hasta que se les puso fuego y con él se dieron. Y en tanto que el dicho alguacil mayor prendía al dicho Narváez, yo con los que conmigo quedaron defendía la subida de la torre a la demás gente que en su socorro venía, e hice tomar toda la artillería y me fortalecí con ella. Por manera que sin muertes de hombres, más de dos que un tiro mató, en una hora eran presos todos los que se habían de prender y tomadas las armas a todos los demás y ellos prometido ser obedientes a la justicia de vuestra majestad, diciendo que hasta allí habían sido engañados, porque les habían dicho que traían provisiones de vuestra alteza y que yo estaba alzado con la tierra y que era traidor a vuestra majestad y les habían hecho entender otras muchas cosas.

Y como todos conocieron la verdad y la mala intención y dañada voluntad del dicho Diego Velázquez y del dicho Narváez y como se habían movido con mal propósito, todos fueron muy alegres, porque así Dios lo había hecho y provisto. Porque certifico a vuestra majestad que si Dios misteriosamente esto no proveyera y la victoria fuera del dicho Narváez, fuera el mayor daño que de mucho tiempo acá en españoles tantos por tantos se ha hecho. Porque él ejecutara el propósito que traía y lo que por Diego Velázquez era mandado, que era ahorcarme a mí y a muchos de los de mi compañía , porque no hubiese quien del hecho diese razón. Y según de los indios yo me informé, tenían acordado que si a mí el dicho Narváez prendiese, como él les había dicho, que no podría ser tan sin daño suyo y de su gente, que muchos de ellos y los de mi compañía no muriesen. Y que entre tanto ellos matarían a los que yo en la ciudad dejaba, como lo acometieron y después se juntarían y darían sobre los que acá quedasen, en manera que ellos y su tierra quedasen libres y de los españoles no quedase memoria. Puede vuestra alteza ser muy cierto que si así lo hicieran y salieran con su propósito, de hoy en veinte años no se tornara a ganar ni a pacificar la tierra, que estaba ganada y pacífica.

Dos días después de preso el dicho Narváez, porque en aquella ciudad no se podía sostener tanta gente junta, mayormente que ya estaba casi destruida, porque los que con el dicho Narváez estaban en ella la habían robado y los vecinos de ella estaban ausentes y sus casas solas, despaché dos capitanes con cada doscientos hombres, el uno para que fuese a hacer el pueblo en el puerto de Cucicacalco, que, como a vuestra alteza he dicho, antes enviaba a hacer y el otro, a aquel río que los navíos de Francisco de Garay dijeron que habían visto, porque ya lo tenía seguro. Y así mismo envié otros doscientos hombres a la Villa de la Vera Cruz, donde hice que los navíos que el dicho Narváez traía viniesen. Y con la gente demás me quedé en la dicha ciudad para proveer lo que al servicio de vuestra majestad convenía. Y despaché un mensajero a la ciudad de Temixtitan y con él hice saber a los españoles que allí había dejado, lo que me había sucedido. El cual dicho mensajero volvió de ahí a doce días y me trajo cartas del alcalde que allí había quedado, en que me hacía saber cómo los indios les habían combatido la fortaleza por todas partes de ella y puéstoles fuego por muchas partes y hecho ciertas minas y que se habían visto en mucho trabajo y peligro y todavía los mataran si el dicho Mutezuma no mandara cesar la guerra; y que aún los tenían cercados, puesto que no los combatían, sin dejar salir ninguno de ellos dos pasos fuera de la fortaleza.

Y que les habían tomado en el combate mucha parte del bastimento que yo les había dejado y que les habían quemado los cuatro bergantines que yo allí tenía y que estaban en muy extrema necesidad y que por amor de Dios los socorriese a mucha prisa. Vista la necesidad en que estos españoles estaban y que si no los socorría, además de matarlos los indios y perderse todo el oro, plata y joyas que en la tierra se habían habido, así de vuestra alteza como de españoles y míos y se perdía la mejor, más noble y mejor ciudad de todo lo nuevamente descubierto del mundo; y ella perdida, se perdía todo lo que estaba ganado, por ser la cabeza de todo y a quien todos obedecían. Y luego despaché mensajeros a los capitanes que habían enviado con la gente, haciéndoles saber lo que me habían escrito de la gran ciudad para que luego, donde quiera que los alcanzasen, volviesen y por el camino principal más cercano se fuesen a la provincia de Tascaltecal, donde yo con la gente estaba en mi compañía y con toda la artillería que pude y con setenta de caballo me fui a juntar con ellos y allí juntos y hecho alarde, se hallaron los dichos setenta de caballo y quinientos peones. Y con ellos a la mayor prisa que pude me partí para la dicha ciudad y en todo el camino nunca me salió a recibir ninguna persona del dicho Mutezuma como antes lo solían hacer y toda la tierra estaba alborotada y casi despoblada, creyendo que los españoles que en la dicha ciudad habían quedado eran muertos y que toda la gente de la tierra estaba junta esperándome en algún paso o parte donde ellos pudiesen aprovechar mejor de mí.

Y con este temor fui al mejor recaudo que pude, hasta que llegué a la ciudad de Tescucan, que, como ya he hecho relación a vuestra majestad, está en la costa de aquella gran laguna. Allí pregunté a algunos de los naturales de ella por los españoles que en la gran ciudad habían quedado. Los cuales me dijeron que eran vivos y yo les dije que me trajesen una canoa, porque yo quería enviar un español a saberlo y que en tanto que él iba, había de quedar conmigo un natural de aquella ciudad que parecía algo principal, porque los señores y principales de ella, de quien yo tenía noticia, no parecía ninguno. Y él mandó traer la canoa y envió ciertos indios con el español que yo enviaba y se quedó conmigo. Y estándose embarcado este español para ir a la dicha ciudad de Temixtitan, vio venir por la mar otra canoa y esperó a que llegase al puerto y en ella venía uno de los españoles que habían quedado en la dicha ciudad, de quien supe que eran vivos todos, excepto cinco o seis que los indios habían matado y que los demás estaban todavía cercados y que no los dejaban salir de la fortaleza ni los proveían de cosas que habían menester, sino por mucha copia de rescate; aunque después de mi ida habían sabido, lo hacían algo mejor con ellos y que el dicho Mutezuma decía que no esperaba sino que yo fuese, para que luego tornasen a andar por la ciudad como antes solían. Y con el dicho español me envió el dicho Mutezuma un mensajero suyo, en que me decía que ya creía que debía saber lo que en aquella ciudad había acaecido y que él tenía pensamiento que por ello yo venía enojado y traía voluntad de hacerle algún daño; que me rogaba que perdiese el enojo, porque a él le había pesado tanto cuanto a mí y que ninguna cosa se había hecho por su voluntad y consentimiento y me envió a decir otras cosas para aplacarme la ira que él creía que yo traía por lo acaecido y que me fuese a la ciudad a aposentar, como antes estaba, porque no menos se haría en ella lo que yo mandase, que antes se solía hacer. Yo le envié a decir que no traía enojo ninguno de él, porque bien sabía su buena voluntad y que así como él lo decía, lo haría yo.

Y otro día siguiente, que fue víspera de San Juan Bautista, partí y dormí en el camino, a tres leguas de la dicha gran ciudad y día de San Juan, después de haber oído misa, partí y entré en ella casi al mediodía y vi poca gente por la ciudad y algunas puertas de las encrucijadas y traviesas de las calles quitadas, que no me pareció bien, aunque pensé que lo hacían de temor de lo que habían hecho y que entrando yo los aseguraría. Con esto me fui a la fortaleza en la cual y en aquella mezquita mayor que estaba junto a ella, se aposentó toda la gente que conmigo venía; y los que estaban en la fortaleza nos recibieron con tanta alegría como si nuevamente les diéramos las vidas, que ya ellos estimaban perdidas y con mucho placer estuvimos aquel día y noche creyendo que ya estaba todo pacífico.

Y otro día después de misa enviaba un mensajero a la Villa de la Vera Cruz, por darles buenas nuevas de cómo los cristianos eran vivos y yo había entrado en la ciudad y estaba segura. El cual mensajero volvió dende a media hora todo descalabrado y herido, dando voces que todos los indios de la ciudad venían de guerra y que tenían todas las puentes alzadas y junto tras él da sobre nosotros tanta multitud de gente por todas partes, que ni las calles ni azoteas se parecían con la gente; la cual venía con los mayores alaridos y grita más espantable que en el mundo se puede pensar y eran tantas las piedras que nos echaban con hondas dentro de la fortaleza, que no parecía sino que el cielo las llovía y las flechas y tiraderas eran tantas, que todas las paredes y patios estaban llenos, que casi no podíamos andar con ellas. Y yo salí fuera a ellos por dos o tres partes y pelearon con nosotros muy reciamente, aunque por la una parte un capitán salió con doscientos hombres y antes que se pudiese recoger le mataron cuatro e hirieron a él y a muchos de los otros; y por la parte que yo andaba, me hirieron a mí y a muchos de los españoles. Y nosotros matamos pocos de ellos, porque se nos acogían de la otra parte de las puentes y de las azoteas y terrados nos hacían daño con piedras, de las cuales azoteas ganamos algunas y quemamos. Pero eran tantas, tan fuertes, de tanta gente pobladas y tan bastecidas piedras y otros géneros de armas, que no bastábamos Para tomarlas todas, ni defender, que ellos no nos ofendiesen a su placer.

En la fortaleza daban tan recto combate, que por muchas partes nos pusieron fuego y por la una se quemó mucha parte de ella, sin poderlo remediar, hasta que la atajamos cortando las paredes y derrocando un pedazo, que mató el fuego. Y si no fuera por la mucha guarda que allí puse de escopeteros y ballesteros y otros tiros de pólvora, nos entraran a escala vista sin poderlos resistir. Así estuvimos peleando todo aquel día, hasta que fue la noche bien cerrada y aún en ella no nos dejaron sin grita y rebato hasta el día. Aquella noche hice reparar los portillos de aquello quemado y todo lo demás que me pareció que en la fortaleza había flaco y concerté las estancias y gente que en ellas había de estar y la que otro día habíamos de salir a pelear fuera e hice curar los heridos, que eran más de ochenta.

Y luego que fue de día, ya la gente de los enemigos nos comenzaba a combatir muy más reciamente que el día pasado, porque estaba tanta cantidad de ellos, que los artilleros no tenían necesidad de puntería, sino asestar en los escuadrones de los indios. Y puesto que la artillería hacía mucho daño, porque jugaban trece arcabuceros, sin las escopetas y ballestas, hacían tan poca mella que ni se parecía que no lo sentían, porque por donde llevaba el tiro diez o doce hombres se cerraba luego de gente, que no parecía que hacía daño ninguno. Y dejado en la fortaleza el recaudo que convenía y se podía dejar, yo torné a salir y les gané algunas de las puentes y quemé algunas casas y matamos muchos en ellas que las defendían y eran tantos, que aunque más daño se hiciera hacíamos muy poquita mella y a nosotros convenía pelear todo el día y ellos peleaban por horas, que se remudaban y aún les sobraba gente.

También hirieron aquel día otros cincuenta o sesenta españoles, aunque no murió ninguno y peleamos hasta que fue de noche, que de cansados nos retrajimos a la fortaleza. Y viendo el gran daño que los enemigos nos hacían y cómo nos herían y mataban a su salvo y que puesto que nosotros hacíamos daño en ellos, por ser tantos no se parecía, toda aquella noche y otro día gastamos en hacer tres ingenios de madera y cada uno llevaba veinte hombres, los cuales iban dentro porque con las piedras que nos tiraban desde las azoteas no los pudiesen ofender, porque iban los ingenios cubiertos de tablas y los que iban dentro eran ballesteros y escopeteros y los demás llevaban picos, azadones y varas de hierro para horadarles las casas y derrocar las albarradas que tenían hechas en las calles. Y en tanto que estos artificios se hacían, no cesaba el combate de los contrarios, en tanta manera, que como salíamos fuera de la fortaleza se querían ellos entrar dentro, a los cuales resistimos con harto trabajo.

Y el dicho Mutezuma, que todavía estaba preso y un hijo suyo, con otros muchos señores que al principio se habían tomado, dijo que le sacasen las azoteas de la fortaleza y que él hablaría a los capitanes de aquella gente y les harían que cesase la guerra. Y yo le hice sacar y en llegando a un pretil que salía fuera de la fortaleza, queriendo hablar a la gente que por allí combatía, le dieron una pedrada los suyos en la cabeza, tan grande, que de allí a tres días murió y yo le hice sacar así muerto a dos indios que estaban presos y a cuestas lo llevaron a la gente y no sé lo que de él hicieron, salvo que no por eso cesó la guerra y muy mas recia y muy cruda de cada día.

Y este día llamaron por aquella parte por donde habían herido al dicho Mutezuma, diciendo que me allegase yo allí, que me querían hablar ciertos capitanes y así lo hice y pasamos entre ellos y mí muchas razones, rogándoles que no peleasen conmigo pues ninguna razón para ello tenían y que mirasen las buenas obras que de mí habían recibido y cómo habían sido muy bien tratados de mí. La respuesta suya era que me fuese y que les dejase la tierra y que luego dejarían la guerra y que de otra manera, que creyese que habían de morir todos o dar fin con nosotros. Lo cual, según pareció, hacían porque yo me saliese de la fortaleza para tomarme a su placer al salir de la ciudad entre las puentes. Yo les respondí que no pensasen que les rogaba con la paz por temor que les tenía, sino porque me pasaba del daño que les hacía y del que había de hacer y por no destruir tan buena ciudad como aquella era; y todavía respondían que no cesarían de darme guerra hasta que saliese de la ciudad. Después de acabados aquellos ingenios, luego otro día salí para ganarles ciertas azoteas y puentes y yendo los ingenios delante y tras ellos cuatro tiros de fuego y otra mucha gente de ballesteros y rodeleros y más de tres mil indios de los naturales de Tascaltecal, que habían venido conmigo y servían a los españoles; y llegados a una puente, pusimos los ingenios arrimados a las paredes de unas azoteas y ciertas escaleras que llevábamos para subirlas y era tanta la gente que estaba en defensa de la dicha puente y azoteas y tantas las piedras que de arriba tiraban y tan grandes, que nos desconcertaron los ingenios y nos mataron un español e hirieron otros muchos, sin poderles ganar ni aún un paso, aunque pugnábamos mucho por ello, porque peleamos desde la mañana hasta mediodía, que nos volvimos con harta tristeza a la fortaleza, de donde cobraron tanto ánimo que casi a las puertas nos llegaban.

Y tomaron aquella mezquita grande y en la torre más alta y más principal de ella se subieron hasta quinientos indios, que, según me pareció, eran personas principales. Y en ella subieron mucho mantenimiento de pan y agua y otras cosas de comer y muchas piedras y todos los demás tenían lanzas muy largas con unos hierros de pedernal más anchos que los de las nuestras y no menos agudos y de allí hacían mucho daño a la gente de la fortaleza porque estaba muy cerca de ella. La cual dicha torre combatieron los españoles dos o tres veces y la acometieron a subir y como era muy alta y tenía la subida agra porque tiene ciento y tantos escalones y los de arriba estaban bien pertrechados de piedras y otras armas y favorecidos a causa de no haberles podido ganar las otras azoteas, ninguna vez los españoles comenzaban a subir que no volvían rodando y herían mucha gente y los que de las otras partes los veían, cobraban tanto ánimo que se nos venían hasta la fortaleza sin ningún temor.

Y yo, viendo que si aquéllos salían con tener aquella torre, demás de hacernos de ella mucho daño, cobraban esfuerzo para ofendernos, salí fuera de la fortaleza, aunque manco de la mano izquierda de una herida que el primer día me habían dado y liada la rodela en el brazo fui a la torre con algunos españoles que me siguieron e hícela cercar toda por bajo, porque se podía muy bien hacer, aunque los sacerdotes no estaban de balde que por todas partes peleaban con los contrarios, de los cuales, por favorecer a los suyos, se recrecieron muchos y yo comencé a subir por la escalera de la dicha torre y tras mí ciertos españoles. Y puesto que nos defendían la subida muy reciamente y tanto, que derrocaron tres o cuatro españoles, con ayuda de Dios y de su gloriosa Madre, por cuya casa aquella torre se había señalado y puesto en ella su imagen, les subimos la dicha torre y arriba peleamos con ellos tanto, que les fue forzado saltar de ella abajo a unas azoteas que tenía alrededor, tan anchas como un paso. Y de éstas tenía la dicha torre tres o cuatro, tan altas la una de la otra como tres estados y algunos cayeron abajo del todo, que demás del daño que recibían de la caída, los españoles que estaban abajo alrededor de la torre los mataban. Y los que en aquellas azoteas quedaron pelearon desde allí tan reciamente, que estuvimos más de tres horas en acabarlos de matar; por manera que murieron todos, que ninguno escapó y crea vuestra sacra majestad que fue tanto ganarles esta torre, que si Dios no les quebrara las alas, bastaban veinte de ellos para resistir la subida a mil hombres. Como quiera que pelearon muy valientemente hasta que murieron e hice poner fuego a la torre y a las otras que en la mezquita había, los cuales habían ya quitado y llevado las imágenes que en ellas teníamos.

Algo perdieron del orgullo con haberles tomado esta fuerza y tanto, que por todas partes aflojaron en mucha manera y luego torné a aquella azotea y hablé a los capitanes que antes habían hablado conmigo, que estaban algo desmayados por lo que habían visto. Los cuales luego llegaron y les dije que mirasen que no se podían amparar y que les hacíamos de cada día mucho daño y que morían muchos de ellos y quemábamos y destruíamos su ciudad y que no había de parar hasta no dejar de ella ni de ellos cosa alguna. Los cuales me respondieron que bien veían que recibían de nosotros mucho daño y que morían muchos de ellos, pero que ellos estaban ya determinados de morir todos por acabarnos y que mirase yo por todas aquellas calles, plazas y azoteas cuán llenas de gente estaban. Y que tenían hecha cuenta que, al morir veinticinco mil de ellos y uno de los nuestros, nos acabaríamos nosotros primero porque éramos pocos y ellos muchos y que me hacían saber que todas las calzadas de las entradas de la ciudad eran deshechas, como de hecho pasaba, que todas las habían deshecho excepto una y que ninguna parte teníamos por do salir sino por el agua y que bien sabían que teníamos pocos mantenimientos y poca agua dulce, que no podíamos durar mucho, que de hambre no nos muriésemos aunque ellos no nos matasen.

Y de verdad que ellos tenían mucha razón; que aunque no tuviéramos otra guerra sino el hambre y necesidad de mantenimientos, bastaba para morir todos en breve tiempo. Y pasamos otras muchas razones, favoreciendo cada uno sus partidos. Ya que fue de noche, salí con ciertos españoles y como los tomé descuidados, ganámosles una calle donde les quemamos más de trescientas casas y luego volví por otra, ya que allí acudía la gente y así mismo quemé muchas casas de ella, en especial ciertas azoteas que estaban junto a la fortaleza, de donde nos hacían mucho daño y con lo que aquella noche se les hizo recibieron mucho temor y en esta misma noche hice tornar y aderezar los ingenios que el día antes nos habían desconcertado.

Y por seguir la victoria que Dios nos daba, salí en amaneciendo por aquella calle donde el día antes nos habían desbaratado, donde no menos defensa hallamos que el primero; pero como nos iban las vidas y la honra, porque por aquella calle estaba sana la calzada que iba hasta la tierra firme, aunque hasta llegar a ella había ocho puentes muy grandes y muy hondas y toda la calle de muchas y altas azoteas y torres, pusimos tanta determinación y ánimo que, ayudándonos Nuestro Señor, les ganamos aquel día las cuatro y se quemaron todas las azoteas, casas y torres que había hasta la postrera de ellas. Aunque por lo de la noche pasada tenían en todas las puentes hechas muchas y muy fuertes albarradas de adobes y barro, en manera que los tiros y ballestas no les podían hacer daño. Las cuales dichas cuatro puentes cegamos con los adobes y tierra de las albarradas y con mucha piedra y madera de las casas quemadas y aunque todo no fue tan sin peligro que no hiriesen muchos españoles. Aquella noche puse mucho recaudo en guardar aquellas puentes porque no las tornasen a ganar y otro día de mañana torné a salir y Dios nos dio así mismo tan buena dicha y victoria, aunque era innumerable gente la que defendía las puentes, albarradas y ojos que aquella noche nos habían hecho, se las ganamos todas y las cegamos.

Asimismo fueron ciertos de caballo siguiendo el alcance y victoria, hasta la tierra firme y estando yo reparando aquellas puentes y haciéndolas cegar, viniéronme a llamar a mucha prisa diciendo que los indios combatían la fortaleza y pedían paces y me estaban esperando allí ciertos señores capitanes de ellos. Y dejando allí toda la gente y ciertos tiros, me fui solo con dos de caballo a ver lo que aquellos principales querían, los cuales me dijeron que si yo les aseguraba que por el hecho no serían punidos, que ellos harían alzar el cerco y tornar a poner las puentes y hacer las calzadas y servirían a vuestra majestad como antes lo hacían. Y rogáronme que hiciese traer allí uno como religioso de los suyos que yo tenía preso, el cual era como general de aquella religión. El cual vino y les habló y dio concierto entre ellos y mí y luego pareció que enviaban mensajeros, según ellos dijeron, a los capitanes y a la gente que tenían en las estancias, a decir que cesase el combate que daban a la fortaleza y toda la otra guerra. Con esto nos despedimos y yo me metí en la fortaleza a comer y en comenzando vinieron a mucha prisa a decirme que los indios habían tornado a ganar las puentes que aquel día les habíamos ganado y que habían muerto ciertos españoles de que Dios sabe cuanta alteración recibí, porque yo pensé que había más que hacer con tener ganada la salida y cabalgué a la mayor prisa que pude y corrí por toda la calle adelante con alguna parte, torné a romper por los dichos indios y les torné a ganar las puentes y fui en alcance de ellos hasta la tierra firme.

Y como los peones estaban cansados, heridos y atemorizados y vi al presente el grandísimo peligro, ninguno me siguió. A cuya causa, después de pasadas yo las puentes, ya que me quise volver, las hallé tomadas y ahondadas mucho, más de lo que habíamos cegado. Y por la una parte y por la otra parte de toda la calzada, llena de gente, así en la tierra como en el agua, en canoas; la cual nos garrochaba y apedreaba en tanta manera que si Dios misteriosamente no nos quisiera salvar, era imposible escapar de allí y aun ya era público entre los que quedaban en la ciudad, que yo era muerto. Y cuando llegué a la postrera puente de hacia la ciudad, hallé a todos los de caballo que conmigo iban, caídos en ella y un caballo suelto. Por manera que yo no pude pasar y me fue forzado de revolver solo contra mis enemigos y con aquello hice algún tanto de lugar para que los caballos pudiesen pasar y yo hallé la puente desembarazada y pasé, aunque con harto trabajo, porque había de la una parte a la otra casi un estado de saltar con el caballo, lo cual por ir yo y él bien armados no nos hirieron, más de atormentar el cuerpo.

Y así quedaron aquella noche con la victoria y ganadas las dichas cuatro puentes y yo dejé en las otras cuatro buen recaudo y fui a la fortaleza e hice hacer una puente de madera que llevaban cuarenta hombres y viendo el gran peligro en que estábamos y el mucho daño que los indios cada día nos hacían y temiendo que también deshiciesen aquella calzada como las otras y deshecha era forzado morir todos y porque de todos los de mi compañía fui requerido muchas veces que me saliese y porque todos los más estaban heridos y tan mal que no podían pelear, acordé de hacerlo aquella noche y tomé todo el oro y joyas de vuestra majestad que se podían sacar y púselo en una sala y allí lo entregué con ciertos líos a los oficiales de vuestra alteza, que yo en su real nombre tenía señalados y a los alcaldes y regidores y a toda la gente que allí estaba, les rogué y requerí que me ayudasen a sacarlo y salvarlo y di una yegua mía para ello, en la cual se cargó tanta parte cuanta yo podía llevar y señalé ciertos españoles, así criados míos como de los otros, que viniesen con el dicho oro y yegua y lo demás los dichos oficiales, alcaldes y regidores y yo lo dimos y repartimos por los españoles para que lo sacasen.

Desamparada la fortaleza, con mucha riqueza así de vuestra alteza como de los españoles y mía, me salí lo más secreto que yo pude, sacando conmigo un hijo y dos hijas del dicho Mutezuma y al otro su hermano que yo había puesto en su lugar y a otros señores de provincias y ciudades que allí tenía presos. Y llegando a las puentes que los indios tenían quitadas, a la primera de ellas se echó la puente que yo traía hecha, con poco trabajo, porque no hubo quien la resistiese, excepto ciertas velas que en ella estaban, las cuales apellidaban tan recio que antes de llegar a la segunda estaba infinita gente de los contrarios sobre nosotros, combatiéndonos por todas partes, así desde el agua como de la tierra y yo pasé presto con cinco de caballo y cien peones, con los cuales pasé a nado todas las puentes y las gané hasta la tierra. Y dejando aquella gente a la delantera, torné a la rezagada donde hallé que peleaban reciamente y que era sin comparación el daño que los nuestros recibían, así los españoles, como los indios de Tascaltecal que con nosotros estaban y así a todos los mataron y muchas naturales de los españoles; y así mismo habían muerto muchos españoles y caballos y perdido todo el oro, joyas, ropa y otras muchas cosas que sacábamos y toda la artillería.

Recogidos los que estaban vivos, los eché adelante y yo con tres o cuatro de caballo y hasta veinte peones que osaron quedar conmigo, me fui en la rezaga peleando con los indios hasta llegar a una ciudad que se dice Tacuba, que está fuera de la calzada, de que Dios sabe cuanto trabajo y peligro recibí; porque todas las veces que volvía sobre los contrarios salía lleno de flechas viras y apedreado, porque como era agua de la una parte y de otra, herían a su salvo sin temor. A los que salían a tierra, luego volvíamos sobre ellos y saltaban al agua, así que recibían muy poco daño si no eran algunos que con los muchos se tropezaban unos con otros y caían y aquellos morían. Y con este trabajo y fatiga llevé toda la gente hasta la dicha ciudad de Tacuba, sin matarme ni herirme ningún español ni indio, sino fue uno de los de caballo que iba conmigo en la rezaga y no menos peleaban así en la delantera como por los lados, aunque la mayor fuerza era en las espaldas por do venía la gente de la gran ciudad.

Y llegado a la dicha ciudad de Tacuba hallé toda la gente remolinada en una plaza, que no sabían dónde ir, a los cuales yo di prisa que se saliesen al campo antes que se recreciese más gente en la dicha ciudad y tomasen las azoteas, porque nos harían de ellas mucho daño. Y los que llevaban la delantera dijeron que no sabían por dónde habían de salir y yo los hice quedar en la rezaga y tomé la delantera hasta sacarlos fuera de la dicha ciudad y esperé en unas labranzas y cuando llegó la rezaga supe que habían recibido algún daño y que habían muerto algunos españoles e indios y que se quedaba por el camino mucho oro perdido, lo cual los indios cogían y allí estuve hasta que pasó toda la gente peleando con los indios, en tal manera, que los detuve para que los peones tomasen un cerro donde estaba una torre y aposento fuerte, el cual tomaron sin recibir algún daño porque no me partí de allí ni dejé pasar los contrarios hasta haber tomado ellos el cerro, en que Dios sabe el trabajo y fatiga que allí se recibió, porque ya no había caballo de veinticuatro que nos habían quedado, que pudiese correr, ni caballero que pudiese alzar el brazo, ni peón sano que pudiese menearse. Llegados al dicho aposento nos fortalecimos en él y allí nos cercaron y estuvimos cercados hasta noche, sin dejarnos descansar una hora. En este desbarato se halló por copia, que murieron ciento cincuenta españoles y cuarenta y cinco yeguas y caballos y más de dos mil indios que servían a los españoles entre los cuales mataron al hijo e hijas de Mutezuma y a todos los otros señores que traíamos presos.

Y aquella noche, a medianoche, creyendo no ser sentidos, salimos del dicho aposento muy calladamente, dejando en él hechos muchos fuegos, sin saber camino ninguno ni para dónde íbamos, más de que un indio de los de Tascaltecal nos guiaba diciendo que él nos sacaría a su tierra si el camino no nos impedían. Y muy cerca estaban guardas que nos sintieron y muy prestos apellidaron muchas poblaciones que había a la redonda, de las cuales se recogió mucha gente y nos fueron siguiendo hasta el día, que ya que amanecía, cinco de caballo que iban delante por corredores, dieron en unos escuadrones de gente que estaban en el camino y mataron algunos de ellos, los cuales fueron desbaratados creyendo que iba más gente de caballo y de pie.

Y porque vi que de todas partes se recrecía la gente de los contrarios, concerté allí la de los nuestros y de la que había sana para algo, hice escuadrones y puse en delantera, rezaga, lados y en medio, los heridos y así mismo repartí los de caballo y así fuimos todo aquel día peleando por todas partes, en tanta manera que en toda la noche y día no anduvimos más de tres leguas y quiso Nuestro señor que ya que la noche sobrevenía, mostrarnos una torre y buen aposento en un cerro, donde así mismo nos hicimos fuertes. Y por aquella noche nos dejaron, aunque, casi al alba, hubo otro cierto rebato sin haber de qué, más del temor que ya todos llevábamos de la multitud de gente que a la continua nos seguía al alcance. Otro día me partí a una hora del día por la orden ya dicha, llevando la delantera y rezaga a buen recaudo y siempre nos seguían de una parte y de otra los enemigos, gritando y apellidando toda aquella tierra, que es muy poblada y los de caballo, aunque éramos pocos, arremetíamos y hacíamos poco daño en ellos, porque como por allí era la tierra algo fragosa, se nos acogían a los cerros y de esta manera fuimos aquel día por cerca de unas leguas, hasta que llegamos a una población buena, donde pensamos haber algún reencuentro con los del pueblo y como llegamos lo desampararon y se fueron a otras poblaciones que estaban por allí a la redonda.

Y allí estuve aquel día y otro, porque la gente, así heridos como los sanos, venían muy cansados y fatigados y con mucha hambre y sed. Y los caballos así mismo traíamos bien cansados y porque allí hallamos algún maíz, que comimos y llevamos por el camino, cocido y tostado; y otro día partimos y siempre acompañados de gente de los contrarios y por la delantera y rezaga nos acometían gritando y haciendo algunas arremetidas y seguimos nuestro camino por donde el indio tascaltecal nos guiaba, por el cual llevábamos mucho trabajo y fatiga, porque nos convenía ir muchas veces fuera de camino. Y ya que era tarde, llegamos a un llano donde había unas casas pequeñas donde aquella noche nos aposentamos, con harta necesidad de comida.

Y otro día, luego por la mañana, comenzamos a andar y aun no éramos salidos al camino, cuando ya la gente de los enemigos nos seguía por la rezaga y escaramuzando con ellos llegamos a un pueblo grande, que estaba dos leguas de allí y a la mano derecha de él estaban algunos indios encima de un cerro pequeño y creyendo de tomarlos, porque estaban muy cerca del camino y también por descubrir si había más gente de la que parecía, detrás del cerro, me fui con cinco de caballo y diez o doce peones, rodeando el dicho cerro y detrás de él estaba una gran ciudad de mucha gente, con los cuales peleamos tanto, que, por ser la tierra donde estaba, algo áspera de piedras y la gente mucha y nosotros pocos, nos convino retraer al pueblo donde los nuestros estaban y de allí salí yo muy mal herido en la cabeza de dos pedradas. Y después de haberme atado las heridas, hice salir los españoles del pueblo porque me pareció que no era aposento seguro para nosotros y así caminando, siguiéndonos todavía los indios en harta cantidad, los cuales pelearon con nosotros tan reciamente que hirieron cuatro o cinco españoles y otros tantos caballos y nos mataron un caballo, que aunque Dios sabe cuánta falta nos hizo y cuánta pena recibimos con habérnosle muerto, porque no teníamos después de Dios otra seguridad sino la de los caballos, nos consoló su carne, porque la comimos sin dejar cuero ni otra cosa de él, según la necesidad que traíamos; porque después que de la gran ciudad salimos ninguna otra cosa comimos sino maíz tostado y cocido y esto no todas veces ni abasto y yerbas que cogíamos del campo.

Y viendo que de cada día sobrevenía más gente y más recia y nosotros íbamos enflaqueciendo, hice aquella noche que los heridos y dolientes, que llevábamos a las ancas de los caballos y a cuestas, hiciesen muletas y otras maneras de ayudas como se pudiesen sostener y andar, porque los caballos y españoles sanos estuviesen libres para pelear. Y pareció que el Espíritu Santo me alumbró con este aviso, según lo que a otro día siguiente sucedió; que habiendo partido en la mañana de este aposento y siendo apartados legua y media de él, yendo por mi camino, salieron al encuentro mucha cantidad de indios y tanta, que por la delantera, lados ni rezaga, ninguna cosa de los campos que se podían ver, había de ellos vacía. Los cuales pelearon con nosotros tan fuertemente por todas partes, que casi no nos conocíamos unos a otros, tan revueltos y juntos andaban con nosotros y cierto creíamos ser aquel el último de nuestros días, según el mucho poder de los indios y la poca resistencia que en nosotros hallaban, por ir, como íbamos, muy cansados y casi todos heridos y desmayados de hambre. Pero quiso Nuestro Señor mostrar su gran poder y misericordia con nosotros, que, con toda nuestra flaqueza, quebrantamos su gran orgullo y soberbia, en que murieron muchos de ellos y muchas personas muy principales y señaladas; porque eran tantos, que los unos a los otros se estorbaban que no podían pelear ni huir. Y con este trabajo fuimos mucha parte del día, hasta que quiso Dios que murió una persona tan principal de ellos, que con su muerte cesó toda aquella guerra.

Así fuimos algo más descansados, aunque todavía mordiéndonos, hasta una casa pequeña que estaba en el llano, adonde por aquella noche nos aposentamos y en el campo y ya desde allí se parecían ciertas sierras de la provincia de Tascaltecal, de que no poca alegría allegó a nuestro corazón, porque ya conocíamos la tierra y sabíamos por dónde habíamos de ir, aunque no estábamos muy satisfechos de hallar los naturales de la dicha provincia seguros y por nuestros amigos, porque creíamos que viéndonos ir tan desbaratados quisieran ellos dar fin a nuestras vidas, por cobrar la libertad que antes tenían. El cual pensamiento y sospecha nos puso en tanta aflicción cuanta traíamos viniendo peleando con los de Culúa.

El día siguiente, siendo ya claro, comenzamos a andar por un camino muy llano que iba derecho a la dicha provincia de Tascaltecal, por el cual nos siguió muy poca gente de los contrarios, aunque había muy cerca de él muchas gentes y grandes poblaciones, puesto que de algunos cerrillos y en la rezaga, aunque lejos, todavía nos gritaban. Y así salimos este día, que fue domingo a 8 de julio, de toda la tierra de Culúa y llegamos a tierra e la dicha provincia de Tascaltecal, a un pueblo de ella que se dice Gualipán de hasta tres o cuatro mil vecinos, donde de los naturales de él fuimos muy bien recibidos y reparados en algo de la gran hambre y cansancio que traíamos, aunque muchas de las provisiones que nos daban eran por nuestros dineros y aunque no querían otro sino de oro y éramos forzados a dárselo por la mucha necesidad en que nos veíamos. En este pueblo estuve tres días, donde me vinieron a ver y hablar Magiscacin y Singutecal y todos los señores de la dicha provincia y algunos de la de Guasucingo, los cuales mostraron mucha pena por lo que nos había acaecido y trabajaron de consolarme diciéndome que muchas veces ellos me habían dicho que los de Culúa eran traidores y que me guardase de ellos y que no lo había querido creer; pero que pues yo había escapado vivo, que me alegrase, que ellos me ayudarían hasta morir para satisfacerme el daño que aquéllos me habían hecho, porque, demás de obligarles a ello ser vasallos de vuestra alteza, se dolían de muchos hijos y hermanos que en mi compañía les habían muerto y de otras muchas injurias que los tiempos pasados de ellos habían recibido. Y que tuviese por cierto que me serían muy ciertos y verdaderos amigos hasta la muerte y que pues yo venía herido y todos los demás de mi compañía estaban muy trabajados, que nos fuésemos a la ciudad, que está cuatro leguas de este pueblo y que allí descansaríamos y nos curarían y repararían de nuestros trabajos y cansancio. Yo se lo agradecí y acepté su ruego y les di algunas pocas cosas de joyas que se habían escapado, de que fueron muy contentos. Y me fui con ellos a la dicha ciudad, donde así mismo hallamos buen recibimiento y Magiscacin me trajo una cama de madera encasada, con alguna ropa de la que ellos tienen, en que durmiese, Porque ninguna trajimos y a todos hizo reparar de lo que él tuvo y pudo.

Aquí en esta ciudad había dejado ciertos enfermos cuando pase a la de Temixtitan y ciertos criados míos con plata y ropas mías y otras cosas de casa y provisiones que yo llevaba, por ir más desocupado si algo se nos ofreciese y se perdieron todas las escrituras y autos que yo había hecho con los naturales de estas partes y quedando así mismo toda la ropa de los españoles que conmigo iban sin llevar otra cosa más de lo que llevaban vestido y con sus capas. Y supe cómo había venido otro criado mío de la Villa de la Vera Cruz, que traía mantenimientos y cosas para mí y con él cinco de caballo y cuarenta y cinco peones. El cual había llevado así mismo consigo a los otros que yo allí había dejado con toda la plata y ropa y otras cosas, así mías como de mis compañeros, con siete mil pesos de oro fundido que yo había dejado allí en dos cofres, sin otras joyas y más otros catorce mil pesos de oro en piezas que en la provincia de Tuchitebeque se habían dado a aquel capitán que yo enviaba a hacer el pueblo, de Cuacuacalco y otras muchas cosas, que valían más de treinta mil pesos de oro y que los indios de Culúa los habían matado en el camino a todos y tomando lo que llevaban y así mismo supe que habían muerto otros muchos españoles Por los caminos, los cuales iban a la dicha ciudad de Temixtitan, creyendo que yo estaba en ella pacífico y que los caminos estaban, como yo antes los tenía, seguros.

De que certifico a vuestra majestad que hubimos todos tanta tristeza que no pudo ser más; porque allende de la pérdida de estos españoles y de los demás que se perdió, fue renovarnos las muertes y pérdidas de los españoles que en la ciudad y puentes de ella y en el camino nos habían muerto; en especial que me puso en mucha sospecha que así mismo hubiesen dado en los de la villa de la Vera Cruz y que los que tuviésemos por amigos, sabiendo nuestro desbarato se hubiesen rebelado. Y luego despaché, para saber la verdad, ciertos mensajeros, con algunos indios que los guiaron; a los cuales les mandé que fuesen fuera de camino hasta llegar a la dicha villa y que muy brevemente me hicieren saber lo que allá pasaba. Quiso Nuestro señor que a los españoles hallaron muy buenos y a los naturales de la tierra muy seguros. Lo cual sabido, fue harto reparo de nuestra pérdida y tristeza; aun para ellos fue muy mala nueva saber nuestro suceso y desbarato.

En esta provincia de Tascaltecal estuve veinte días curándome de las heridas que traía, porque con el camino y mala cura se me había empeorado mucho, en especial las de la cabeza y haciendo curar así mismo a los de mi compañía que estaban heridos. Algunos murieron, así de las heridas como del trabajo pasado y otros quedaron mancos y cojos, porque traían muy malas heridas y para curarse había muy poco refrigerio y yo así mismo quedé manco de dos dedos de la mano izquierda.

Viendo los de mi compañía que eran muertos muchos y que los que restaban quedaban flacos, heridos y atemorizados de los peligros y trabajos en que se habían visto y temiendo los por venir, que estaban a razon muy cercanos, fui por muchas veces requerido que me fuese a la Villa de la Vera Cruz y que allí nos haríamos fuertes antes que los naturales de la tierra, que teníamos por amigos, viendo nuestro desbarato y pocas fuerzas se confederasen con los enemigos y nos tomasen los puertos que habíamos de pasar y diesen en nosotros por una parte y por otra en los de la Villa de la Vera Cruz y que estando todos juntos y allí los navíos, estaríamos más fuertes y nos podríamos mejor defender, puesto que nos acometiesen, hasta tanto que enviásemos por socorro a las islas.

Y yo, viendo que mostrar a los naturales poco ánimo, en especial a nuestros amigos, era causa de más aína dejarnos y ser contra nosotros, acordándome que siempre a los osados ayuda la fortuna y que éramos cristianos y confiando en la grandísima bondad y misericordia de Dios, que no permitiría que del todo pareciésemos y se perdiese tanta y tan noble tierra como para vuestra majestad estaba pacífica y en punto de pacificarse, ni se dejase de hacer tan gran servicio como se hacía en continuar la guerra, por cuya causa se había de seguir la pacificación de la tierra como antes estaba, acordé y me determiné de por ninguna manera bajar los puertos hacia la mar; antes pospuesto todo trabajo y peligro que se nos pudiesen ofrecer, les dije que yo no había de desamparar esta tierra, porque en ello me parecía que, demás de ser vergonzoso a mi persona y a todos muy peligroso, a vuestra majestad hacíamos muy gran traición. Y que antes me determinaba de por todas las partes que pudiese, volver contra los enemigos y ofenderlos por cuantas vías a mí fuese posible.

Y habiendo estado en esta provincia veinte días, aunque ni yo estaba muy sano de mis heridas y los de mi compañía todavía bien flacos, salí de ella para otra que se dice Tepeaca, que era de la liga y consorcio de los de Culúa, nuestros enemigos; de donde estaba informado que habían muerto diez o doce españoles que venían de la Vera Cruz a la gran ciudad, porque por allí es el camino. La cual provincia de Tepeaca confina y parte términos con la de Tascaltecal y Churultecal, porque es muy gran provincia. Y en entrando por tierra de la dicha provincia, salió mucha gente de los naturales de ella a pelear con nosotros y pelearon y nos defendieron a la entrada cuanto a ellos fue posible, poniéndose en los pasos fuertes y peligrosos. Y por no dar cuenta de todas las particularidades que nos acaecieron en esta guerra, que sería prolijidad, no diré sino que, después de hechos los requerimientos para que viniesen a obedecer los mandamientos que de parte de vuestra majestad se les hacían acerca de la paz, no los quisieron cumplir y les hicimos la guerra y pelearon muchas veces con nosotros y con la ayuda de Dios y de la real ventura de vuestra alteza siempre los desbaratamos y matamos muchos, sin que en toda la dicha guerra me matasen ni hiriesen ni un español.

Y aunque, como he dicho, esta dicha provincia es muy grande, en obra de veinte días hube pacíficas muchas villas y poblaciones a ella sujetas y los señores y principales de ellas han venido a ofrecerse y dar por vasallos de vuestra majestad y demás de esto, he echado de todas ellas muchos de los de Culúa que habían venido de esta dicha provincia a favorecer a los naturales de ella para hacernos guerra y aun estorbarles que por fuerza ni grado no fuesen nuestros amigos. Por manera que hasta ahora he tenido en qué entender en esta guerra y aun todavía no es acabada, porque me quedan algunas villas y poblaciones que pacificar, las cuales, con ayuda de Nuestro Señor, presto estarán, como estas otras, sujetas al real dominio de vuestra majestad.

En cierta parte de esta provincia, que es donde mataron aquellos diez españoles, porque los naturales de allí siempre estuvieron muy de guerra y muy rebeldes y por fuerza de armas se tomaron, hice ciertos esclavos, de que se dio el quinto a los oficiales de vuestra majestad; porque, demás de haber muerto a los dichos españoles y rebeládose contra el servicio de vuestra alteza, comen todos carne humana, por cuya notoriedad no envío a vuestra majestad probanza de ello. Y también me movió a hacer los dichos esclavos por poner algún espanto a los de Culúa y porque también hay tanta gente, que si no se hiciese grande el castigo y cruel en ellos, nunca se enmendarían jamás. En esta guerra nos anduvimos con ayuda de los naturales de la provincia de Tascaltecal y Churultecal y Guasucingo, donde han bien confirmado la amistad con nosotros y tenemos mucho concepto que servirán siempre como leales vasallos de vuestra alteza.

Estando en esta provincia de Tepeaca haciendo esta guerra, recibí cartas de la Vera Cruz, por las cuales me hacían saber cómo allí al puerto de ella habían llegado doce navíos de los de Francisco de Garay, desbaratados; que según parece, él había tornado a enviar con más gente a aquel río grande de que yo hice relación a vuestra alteza y que los naturales de ella habían peleado con ellos y les habían matado diecisiete o dieciocho cristianos y herido otros muchos. así mismo les habían matado siete caballos y que los españoles que quedaron se habían entrado a nado en los navíos y se habían escapado por buenos pies; que el capitán y todos ellos venían muy perdidos y heridos y que el teniente que yo había dejado en la villa los había recibido muy bien y hecho curar. Y porque mejor pudiesen convalecer, habían enviado cierta parte de los dichos españoles a tierra de un señor nuestro amigo, que está cerca de allí, donde eran bien provistos.

De lo cual todo nos pesó tanto como de nuestros trabajos pasados y por ventura no les acaeciera este desbarato si la otra vez ellos Vinieran a mí, como ya he hecho relación a vuestra alteza; porque como yo estaba muy y informado de las codas de estas partes, pudieran haber de mí tal aviso por donde no les acaeciera lo que les acaeció; especialmente que el señor de aquel río y tierra, que se dice Pánuco, se había dado por vasallo de vuestra sacra majestad, en cuyo reconocimiento me había enviado a la ciudad de Temixtitan, con sus mensajeros, ciertas cosas, como ya he dicho. Yo he escrito a la dicha villa que si el capitán del dicho Francisco de Garay y su gente se quisiesen ir, les den favor y los ayuden para despacharse ellos y sus navíos.

Después de haber pacificado lo que toda esta provincia de Tepeaca se pacificó y sujetó al real servicio de vuestra alteza, los oficiales de vuestra majestad y yo platicamos muchas veces la orden que se debía de tener en la seguridad de esta provincia.

Y viendo cómo los naturales de ella, habiéndose dado por vasallos de vuestra alteza, se habían rebelado y muerto por españoles y cómo están en el camino y paso por donde la contratación de todos los puertos de la mar es para la tierra adentro y considerando que si esta dicha provincia se dejase sola, como de antes, los naturales de la tierra y señorío de Culúa, que están cerca de ellos, los tornarían a inducir y atraer a que otra vez se levantasen y rebelasen, de donde se seguiría mucho daño e impedimento a la pacificación de estas partes y al servicio de vuestra alteza y cesaría la dicha contratación, mayormente que para el camino de la costa de la mar no hay más que dos puertos muy agros y ásperos, que confinan con esta provincia y los naturales de ella los podrían defender con poco trabajo suyo y así por esto como por otras razones y causas muy convenientes, nos pareció que para evitar lo ya dicho se debía de hacer en esta dicha provincia de Tepeaca una villa en la mejor parte de ella, adonde concurriesen las calidades necesarias para los pobladores de ella.

Y poniéndolo en efecto, yo, en nombre de vuestra majestad, puse su nombre a la dicha villa, Segura de la Frontera y nombré alcaldes y regidores y otros oficiales, conforme a lo que se acostumbra. Y por más seguridad de los vecinos de esta villa, en el lugar donde señalé se ha comenzado a traer materiales para hacer la fortaleza porque aquí los hay buenos y se dará en ella toda la prisa que sea más posible.

Estando escribiendo esta relación vinieron a mí ciertos mensajeros del señor de una ciudad que está cinco leguas de esta provincia, que se llama Guacachula y es a la entrada de un puerto que se pasa para entrar a la provincia de México por allí; los cuales de parte del dicho señor me dijeron que, porque ellos pocos días ha habían venido a mí a dar la obediencia que a vuestra sacra majestad debían y se habían ofrecido por sus vasallos y que porque yo no los culpase, creyendo que por su consentimiento era, me hacían saber cómo en la dicha ciudad estaban aposentados ciertos capitanes de Culúa y que en ella y a una legua de ella estaban treinta mil hombres en guarnición, guardando aquel puerto y paso para que no pudiésemos pasar por él y también para defender que los naturales de la dicha ciudad ni de otras provincias a ellas comarcanas sirviesen a vuestra alteza ni fuesen nuestros amigos. Y que algunos hubieran venido a ofrecerse a su real servicio si aquéllos no lo impidiesen y que me lo hacían saber para que lo remediase, porque demás del impedimento que era a los que buena voluntad tenían, los de la dicha ciudad y todos los comarcanos recibían mucho daño. Porque, como estaba mucha gente junta y de guerra, eran muy agraviados y maltratados, y les tomaban sus mujeres y haciendas y otras cosas; y que viese yo qué era lo que mandaba que ellos hiciesen y que dándoles favor, ellos lo harían. Y luego, después de haberles agradecido su aviso y ofrecimiento, les di trece de caballo y doscientos peones que con ellos fuesen y hasta treinta mil indios de nuestros amigos. Y fue el concierto que los llevaría por partes que no fuesen sentidos y que después que llegase junto a la ciudad el señor y los naturales de ella y los demás sus vasallos y valedores, estarían apercibidos y cercarían los aposentos donde los capitanes estaban aposentados y los prenderían y matarían antes que la gente los pudiese socorrer y que cuando la gente viniese, ya los españoles estarían dentro de la ciudad y pelearían con ellos y los desbaratarían.

Idos ellos y los españoles, fueron por la ciudad de Chururtecal y por alguna parte de la provincia de Guasucingo, que confina con la tierra de esta ciudad de Guacachula, hasta cuatro leguas de ella y en un pueblo de la dicha provincia de Guasucingo, dizque dijeron a los españoles que los naturales de esta provincia estaban confederados con los de Guacachula y con los de Culúa para que debajo de aquella cautela llevasen a los españoles a la dicha ciudad y que allá todos juntos diesen en los dichos españoles y les matasen. Y como aún no del todo era salido el temor que los de Culúa en su ciudad y en su tierra nos pusieron, puso espanto esta información a los españoles y el capitán que yo enviaba con ellos hizo sus pesquisas como lo supo entender y prendieron todos aquellos señores de Guacachula y presos, con ellos se volvieron a la ciudad de Chururtecal, que está cuatro leguas de allí y desde allí me enviaron todos los presos con cierta gente de caballo y peones, con la información que habían habido. Y demás de esto me escribió el capitán que los nuestros estaban atemorizados y que le parecía que aquella jornada era muy dificultosa. Llegados los presos les hablé con las lenguas que yo tengo y habiendo puesto toda diligencia para saber la verdad, pareció que no los había el capitán bien entendido. Y luego los mandé soltar y los satisfice con que yo creía que aquéllos eran leales vasallos de vuestra sacra majestad y que yo quería ir en persona a desbaratar aquellos de Culúa y por no mostrar flaqueza ni temor a los naturales de la tierra, así a los amigos como a los enemigos, me pareció que no debía cesar la jornada comenzada. Y por quitar algún temor del que los españoles tenían, determiné de dejar los negocios y despacho para vuestra majestad, en que entendía y a la hora me partí a la mayor prisa que pude y llegué aquel día a la ciudad de Chururtecal, que está ocho leguas de esta villa, donde hallé a los españoles, que todavía se afirmaban ser cierta la traición.

Y otro día fui a dormir al pueblo de Guasucingo donde los señores habían sido presos. El día siguiente, después de haber concertado con los mensajeros de Guacachula el por dónde y cómo había de entrar en la dicha ciudad, me partí para allá una hora antes que amaneciese y fui sobre ella casi a las diez del día. Y a media legua me salieron al camino ciertos mensajeros de la dicha ciudad y me dijeron como estaba todo muy bien provisto y a punto y que los de Culúa no sabían nada de nuestra venida, porque ciertas espías que ellos tenían en los caminos, los naturales de la dicha ciudad las habían prendido y así mismo habían hecho a otros que los capitanes de Culúa enviaban a asomarse por las cercas y torres de la ciudad a descubrir el campo y que a esta causa toda la gente de los contrarios estaba muy descuidada, creyendo que tenían recaudo en sus velas y escuchas; por tanto, que llegase, que no podía ser sentido. Y así, me di mucha prisa por llegar a la ciudad sin ser sentido, porque íbamos por un llano donde desde allá nos podrían bien ver.

Y según pareció, como de los de la ciudad fuimos vistos, viendo que tan cerca estábamos, luego cercaron los aposentos donde los dichos capitanes estaban y comenzaron a pelear con los demás que por la ciudad estaban repartidos. Y cuando yo llegué a un tiro de ballesta de la dicha ciudad ya me traían hasta cuarenta prisioneros y todavía me di prisa a entrar. Dentro en la ciudad andaba muy gran grita por todas las calles; peleando con los contrarios y guiando por un natural de la dicha ciudad, llegué al aposento donde los capitanes estaban, el cual hallé cercado de más de tres mil hombres que peleaban por entrarles por la puerta y les tenían tomados todos los altos y azoteas. Los capitanes y la gente que con ellos se halló peleaban tan bien y esforzadamente, que no les podían entrar el aposento, puesto que eran pocos; porque, demás de pelear ellos como valientes hombres, el aposento era muy fuerte y como yo llegué luego entramos y entró tanta gente de los naturales de la ciudad, que en ninguna manera los podíamos socorrer, que muy brevemente no fuesen muertos.

Porque yo quisiera tomar algunos a vida, para informarme de las cosas de la gran ciudad y de quién era señor después de la muerte de Mutezuma y de otras cosas y no pude tomar sino a uno mas muerto que vivo, del cual me informé, como adelante diré.

Por la ciudad mataron muchos de ellos que en ella estaban aposentados; y los que estaban vivos cuando yo en la ciudad entré, sabiendo mi venida, comenzaron a huir hacia donde estaba la gente que tenían en guarnición, y en el alcance así mismo murieron muchos. Y fue tan presto oído y sabido este tumulto por la dicha gente de la guarnición, porque estaba en un alto llano del derredor, que casi a una sazón llegaron los que salían huyendo de la dicha ciudad y la gente que venía en socorro y a ver qué cosa era aquella. Los cuales eran más de treinta mil hombres y las más lucida gente que hemos visto, porque traían muchas joyas de oro y plata y plumajes; y como es grande la ciudad, comenzaron a poner fuego en ella por aquella parte por donde entraban. Lo cual fue muy presto hecho saber por los naturales, y salí con sola la gente de caballo, porque los peones estaban ya muy cansados, y rompimos por ellos, y retrajéronse a un paso, el cual les ganamos, y salimos tras ellos, alcanzando muchos por una cuesta arriba muy agra, y tal, que cuando acabamos de encumbrar la sierra, ni los enemigos ni nosotros podíamos ir atrás ni adelante. Y así cayeron muchos de ellos muertos y ahogados de la calor, sin herida ninguna, y dos caballos, se ancaron y el uno murió. Y de esta manera hicimos mucho daño, porque ocurrieron muchos indios de los amigos nuestros, y como iban descansados, y los contrarios casi muertos, mataron muchos. Por manera que en poco rato estaba el campo vacío de los vivos, aunque de los muertos algo ocupado; y llegamos a los aposentos y albergues que tenían hechos en el campo nuevamente, que en tres partes que estaban, parecían cada una de ellas una razonable villa, porque, además de la gente de guerra, tenían mucho aparato de servidores y fornecimiento para su real, porque, según después supe, en ellos había personas principales; lo cual fue todo despojado y quemado por los indios nuestros amigos, y certifico a vuestra sacra majestad que había ya juntos de los dichos nuestros amigos más de cien mil hombres. Y con esta victoria, habiendo echado todos los enemigos de la tierra, hasta los pasar allende unas puentes y malos pasos que ellos tenían, nos volvimos a la ciudad, donde de los naturales fuimos bien recibidos y aposentados, y descansamos en la dicha ciudad tres días, de que teníamos bien necesidad.

En este tiempo vinieron a se ofrecer al real servicio de vuestra majestad los naturales de una población grande que está encima de aquellas sierras, dos leguas de donde el real de los enemigos estaba, y también al pie de la sierra, donde he dicho que sale aquel humo, que se llama esta dicha población Ocupatuyo. Y dijeron que el señor que allí tenían se había ido con los de Culúa al tiempo que por allí los habíamos corrido, creyendo que no parábamos hasta su pueblo, y que muchos días había que ellos quisieran mi amistad, y haber venido a se ofrecer por vasallos de vuestra majestad, sino que aquel señor no los dejaba ni había querido, puesto que ellos muchas veces se lo habían requerido y dicho. Y que ahora ellos querían servir a vuestra alteza; y que allí había quedado un hermano del dicho señor, el cual siempre había sido de su opinión y propósito, y ahora así mismo lo era. Y que me rogaban que tuviese por bien que aquel sucediese en el señorío, y que aunque el otro volviese, que no consintiese que por señor fuese recibido, y que ellos tampoco lo recibirían. Y yo les dije que por haber sido hasta allí de la liga y parcialidad de los de Culúa, y se haber rebelado contra el servicio de vuestra majestad, eran dignos de mucha pena, y que así tenía pensando de la ejecutar en sus personas y haciendas; pero que pues habían venido, y decían que la causa de su rebelión y alzamiento había sido aquel señor que tenían, que yo, en nombre de vuestra majestad, les perdonaba el yerro pasado, y los recibía y admitía a su real servicio, y que los apercibía que si otra vez semejante yerro cometiesen, serian punidos y castigados, y que si leales vasallos a vuestra alteza fuesen, serían de mí, en su real nombre, muy favorecidos y ayudados; y así lo prometieron.

Esta ciudad de Guacachula está asentada en un llano, arrimada por la una parte a unos muy altos y ásperos cerros, y por la otra todo el llano la cercan dos ríos, a dos tiros de ballesta el uno del otro, que cada uno tiene muy altas y muy grandes barrancas. Y tanto, que para la ciudad hay por ellos muy pocas entradas, y las que hay son ásperas de bajar y subir, que apenas las pueden bajar y subir cabalgando. Y toda la ciudad está cercada de muy fuerte muro de cal y canto, tan alto como cuatro estados por de fuera de la ciudad, y por dentro está casi igual con el suelo. Y por toda la muralla va su petril tan alto como medio estado; para pelear tiene cuatro entradas tan anchas como uno puede entrar a caballo, y hay en cada entrada tres o cuatro vueltas de la cerca, que encabalga en un lienzo en el otro, y hacia a aquellas vueltas hay también encima de la muralla su petril para pelear. En toda la cerca tienen mucha cantidad de piedras grandes y pequeñas y de todas maneras con que pelean. Será esta ciudad de hasta cinco o seis mil vecinos, y tendrá de aldeas a ellas sujetas otros tantos y más. Tiene muy gran sitio, porque de dentro de ella hay muchas huertas y frutas y flores a su costumbre.

Y después de haber reposado en esta dicha ciudad tres días, fuimos a otra ciudad que se dice Izcucan, que está cuatro leguas de ésta de Guacachula, porque fui informado que en ella así mismo había mucha gente de los de Culúa en guarnición, y que los de la dicha ciudad y otras villas y lugares sus sufragáneos, eran y se mostraban muy parciales de los de Culúa, porque el señor de ella era su natural, y aun pariente de Mutezuma. Iba en mi compañía tanta gente de los naturales de la tierra, vasallos de vuestra majestad, que casi podíamos alcanzar a ver. Y de verdad había más de ciento y veinte mil hombres. Llegamos sobre la dicha ciudad de Izcucan a hora de las diez, y estaba despoblada de mujeres y de gente menuda, y había en ella hasta cinco o seis mil hombres de guerra muy bien aderezados. Y como los españoles llegamos delante, comenzaron algo a defender su ciudad; pero en poco rato la desampararon, porque por la parte que fuimos guiados para entrar en ella estaba razonable la entrada. Seguímoslos por toda la ciudad hasta los hacer saltar por encima de los adarves a un río que por la otra parte la cerca toda, del cual tenían quebradas las puentes, y nos detuvimos algo en pasar, y seguimos el alcance hasta legua y media más, en que creo se escaparon pocos de aquellos que allí quedaron.

Vueltos a la ciudad, envié dos de los naturales de ella, que estaban presos, a que hablasen a las personas principales de la dicha ciudad, porque el señor de ella se había también ido con los de Culúa que estaban allí en guarnición, para que los hiciese volver a su ciudad; y que yo les prometía en nombre de vuestra majestad, que siendo ellos leales vasallos de vuestra alteza de allí adelante serían de mí muy bien tratados, y perdonados de la rebelión y yerro pasado. Los dichos naturales fueron, y dende a tres días vinieron algunas personas principales y pidieron perdón de su yerro, diciendo que no habían podido más, porque habían hecho lo que su señor les mandó; y que ellos prometían de ahí adelante, pues su señor era ido y dejádolos, de servir a vuestra majestad muy bien y lealmente. Yo les aseguré y dije que se viniesen a sus casas, y trajesen sus mujeres e hijos, que estaban en otros lugares y villas de su parcialidad. Y les dije que hablasen así mismo a los naturales de ellas para que viniesen a mí y que yo les perdonaba lo pasado; y que no quisiesen que yo hubiese de ir sobre ellos, porque recibirían mucho daño, de lo cual me pesaría mucho, y así fue hecho.

De ahí a tres días se tornó a poblar la dicha ciudad de Izcucan, y todos los sufragáneos a ella vinieron a se ofrecer por vasallos de vuestra alteza, y quedó toda aquella provincia muy segura, y por nuestros amigos y confederados con los de Guacachula. Porque hubo cierta diferencia sobre a quien pertenecía el señorío de aquella ciudad y provincia de Izcucan por ausencia del que se había ido a México. Y puesto que hubo algunas contradicciones y parcialidades entre un hijo bastardo del señor natural de la tierra, que había sido muerto por Mutezuma, y puesto el que a la sazón era, y casádole con una sobrina suya, y entre un nieto del dicho señor natural, hijo de su hija legítima, la cual estaba casada con el señor de Guacachula, y habían habido aquel hijo, nieto del dicho señor natural de Izcucan, se acordó entre ellos que heredase el señorío aquel hijo del señor de Guacachula, que venía de legítima línea de los señores de allí. Y puesto que el otro fuese hijo, que por ser bastardo no debía de ser señor, así quedó, y obedecieron en mi presencia a aquel muchacho, que es de edad de hasta diez años; y que por no ser de edad para gobernar, que aquel su tío bastardo y otros tres principales, uno de la ciudad de Guacachula y los dos de Izcucan, fuesen gobernadores de la tierra y tuviesen al muchacho en su poder hasta tanto que fuese de edad para gobernar.

Esta ciudad de Izcucan será de hasta tres o cuatro mil vecinos; es muy concertada en sus calles y tratos; tenía cien casas de mezquitas y oratorios muy fuertes con sus torres, las cuales todas se quemaron. Está en un llano a la falda de un cerro mediano, donde tiene una muy buena fortaleza; y por la otra parte de hacia el llano está cercada de un hondo río que pasa junto a la cerca, y está cercada de la barranca del río, que es muy alta, y sobre la barranca hecho un petril toda la ciudad en torno, tan alto como un estado; tenía por toda esta cerca muchas piedras. Tiene un valle redondo, muy fértil de frutas y algodón, que en ninguna parte de los puertos arriba se hace, por la gran frialdad, y allí es tierra caliente, y cáusalo que está muy abrigado de sierras. Todo este valle se riega por muy buenas acequias, que tiene muy bien sacadas y concertadas.

En esta ciudad estuve hasta la dejar muy poblada y pacífica; y a ella vinieron así mismo a se ofrecer por vasallos de vuestra majestad el señor de una ciudad que se dice Guajocingo, y el señor de otra ciudad que está a diez leguas de esta de Izcucan, y son fronteros de la tierra de México. También vinieron de ocho pueblos de la provincia de Coastoaca, que es una de que en los capítulos antes de éste hice mención que habían visto los españoles que yo envié a buscar oro a la provincia de Zuzula; donde, y en la de Tamazuela, porque está junto a ella, dije que había muy grandes poblaciones y casas muy bien obradas, de mejor cantería que en ninguna de estas partes se había visto. La cual dicha provincia de Coastoaca está cuarenta leguas de allí de Izcucan; y los naturales de los dichos ocho pueblos se ofrecieron así mismo por vasallos de vuestra alteza, y dijeron que otros cuatro que restaban en la dicha provincia vendrían muy presto; y me dijeron que les perdonase porque antes no habían venido, que la causa había sido no osar por temor de los de Culúa; porque ellos nunca habían tomado armas contra mí, ni habían sido en muerte de ningún español, y que siempre, después que al servicio de vuestra alteza se habían ofrecido, habían sido buenos y leales vasallos suyos en sus voluntades, pero que no las habían osado manifestar por temor de los de Culúa. De manera, que puede vuestra alteza ser muy cierto que, siendo Nuestro señor servido en su real ventura, en muy breve tiempo se tornará a ganar lo perdido o mucha parte de ello; porque de cada día se vienen a ofrecer por vasallos de vuestra majestad de muchas provincias y ciudades que antes eran sujetas a Mutezuma, viendo que los que así lo hacen son de mí muy bien recibidos y tratados, y los que al contrario, de cada día destruidos.

De los que en la ciudad de Guacachula se prendieron, en especial de aquel herido, supe muy por extenso las cosas de la gran ciudad de Temixtitan, y cómo después de la muerte de Mutezuma había sucedido en el señorío un hermano suyo, señor de la ciudad de Ixtapalapa que se llamaba Cuetravacin, el cual sucedió en el señorío porque murió en las puentes el hijo de Mutezuma, que heredaba el señorío, y otros dos hijos suyos que quedaron vivos; el uno dicen que es loco y el otro perlático, y a esta causa decían aquellos que había heredado aquel hermano suyo; y también porque él nos había hecho la guerra y porque lo tenía por valiente hombre, muy prudente. Supe así mismo cómo se fortalecían, así en la ciudad como en todas las otras de su señorío, y hacían muchas cercas y cavas y fosados, y muchos géneros de armas; en especial supe que hacían lanzas largas como piernas para los caballos, y aún ya hemos visto algunas de ellas. Porque de esta provincia de Tepeaca se hallaron algunas con que pelearon, y en los ranchos y aposentos en que la gente de Culúa estaba en Guacachula se hallaron así mismo muchas de ellas. Otras muchas cosas supe que, por no dar a vuestra alteza importunidad, dejo.

Yo envío a la isla Española cuatro navíos para que luego vuelvan cargados de caballos y gente para nuestro socorro; y así mismo envío a comprar otros cuatro para que, desde la dicha isla Española y ciudad de Santo Domingo, traigan caballos y armas y ballestas y pólvora, porque esto es lo que en estas partes es más necesario; porque peones y rodeleros aprovechan muy poco solos, por ser tanta cantidad de gente y tener tan fuertes y grandes ciudades y fortalezas, y escribo al licenciado Rodrigo de Figueroa, y a los oficiales de vuestra alteza que residen en la dicha isla, que den para ello todo el favor y ayuda que ser pudiere, porque así conviene mucho al servicio de vuestra alteza y a la seguridad de nuestras personas; porque viniendo esta ayuda y socorro, pienso volver sobre aquella gran ciudad y su tierra, y creo, como ya a vuestra majestad he dicho, que en muy breve tornará al estado en que antes yo la tenía, y se restaurarán las pérdidas pasadas. En tanto, yo quedo haciendo doce bergantines para entrar por la laguna, y estáse labrando ya la tablazón y piezas de ellos, porque así se han de llevar por tierra, porque en llegando, luego se liguen y acaben en breve tiempo; y así mismo se hace clavazón para ellos, y está aparejada pez y estopa, y velas y remos, y las otras cosas para ello necesarias. Y certifico a vuestra majestad que hasta conseguir este fin no pienso tener descanso ni cesar para ello todas las formas y maneras a mí posibles, posponiendo para ello todo el trabajo y peligro y costa que se me puede ofrecer.

Habrá dos o tres días que por carta del teniente que en mi lugar está en la Villa de la Vera Cruz, supe cómo al puerto de la dicha villa había llegado una carabela pequeña con hasta treinta hombres de mar y tierra, que dizque venía en busca de la gente que Francisco de Garay había enviado a esta tierra, de que ya a vuestra alteza he hecho relación, y cómo había llegado con mucha necesidad de bastimentos; y tanta, que si no hubieran hallado allí socorro se murieran de sed y hambre. Supe de ellos cómo habían llegado al río de Pánuco, y estado en él treinta días surtos, y no había visto gente en todo el río ni tierra; de donde se cree que a causa de lo que allí sucedió se ha despoblado aquella tierra. Y asimismo dijo la gente de la dicha carabela que luego tras ellos habían de venir otros dos navíos del dicho Francisco de Garay con gentes y caballos y que creían que eran ya pasados la costa abajo, y pareciome que cumplía al servicio de vuestra alteza, porque aquellos navíos y gente que en ellos iba no se pierda y yendo desproveídos de aviso de las cosas de la tierra, los naturales no hiciesen en ellos más daño de lo que en los primeros hicieron, enviar la dicha carabela en busca de los dos navíos para que los avisen de lo pasado, y se viniesen al puerto de la dicha villa, donde el capitán que envió el dicho Francisco de Garay primero estaba esperándoles. Plega a Dios que los halle y a tiempo que no hayan salido a tierra, porque según los naturales ya estaban sobre aviso, y los españoles sin él, temo recibirían mucho daño, y de ello Dios Nuestro señor y vuestra alteza serían muy deservidos, porque sería encarnar más aquellos perros de lo que están encarnados, y darles más ánimo y osadía para acometer a los que adelante fueren.

En un capítulo antes de éstos he dicho cómo había sabido que por muerte de Mutezuma había alzado por señor a su hermano, que se dice Cuetravacin, el cual aparejaba muchos géneros de armas y se fortalecía en la gran ciudad y en otras ciudades cerca de la laguna. Y ahora de poco a acá he así mismo sabido que el dicho Cuetravacin ha enviado sus mensajeros por todas las tierras y provincias y ciudades sujetas a aquel señorío, a decir y certificar a sus vasallos que él les hace gracia por un año de todos los tributos y servicios que son obligados a le hacer, y que no le den ni le paguen cosa alguna, con tanto que por todas las maneras que pudiesen hiciesen muy cruel guerra a todos los cristianos hasta los matar o echar de toda la tierra; y que así mismo la hiciesen a todos los naturales que fuesen nuestros amigos y aliados; y aunque tengo esperanza en Nuestro señor que en ninguna cosa saldrán con su intención y propósito, hállome en muy extrema necesidad para socorrer y ayudar a los indios nuestros amigos, porque cada día vienen de muchas ciudades y villas y poblaciones a pedir socorro contra los indios de Culúa, sus enemigos y nuestros, que les hacen cuanta guerra pueden, a causa de tener nuestra amistad y alianza, y yo no puedo socorrer a todas partes, como querría. Pero, corno digo, placerá a Nuestro Señor, suplir a nuestras pocas fuerzas, y enviara presto el socorro, así el suyo como el que yo envío a pedir a la Española.

Por lo que yo he visto y comprendido cerca de la similitud que toda esta tierra tiene a España, así en la fertilidad como en la grandeza y fríos que en ella hace, y en otras muchas cosas que la equiparan a ella, me pareció que el más conveniente nombre para esta dicha tierra era llamarse la Nueva España del mar Oceáno; y así, en nombre de vuestra majestad se le puso aqueste nombre. Humildemente suplico a vuestra alteza lo tenga por bien y mande que se nombre así.

Yo he escrito a vuestra majestad, aunque mal dicho, la verdad de todo lo sucedido en estas partes y aquello que de más necesidad hay de hacer saber a vuestra alteza; y por otra mía, que va con la presente, envío a suplicar a vuestra real excelencia mande enviar una persona de confianza que haga inquisición y pesquisa de todo e informe a vuestra sacra majestad de ello. También en ésta lo torno humildemente a suplicar, porque en tan señalada merced lo tendré como en dar entero crédito a lo que escribo.

Muy alto y muy excelentísimo príncipe, Dios Nuestro señor la vida y muy real persona y muy poderoso estado de vuestra sacra majestad conserve y aumente por muy largos tiempos, con acrecentamiento de muy mayores reinos y señoríos, como su real corazón desea. De la villa Segura de la Frontera de esta Nueva España, a 30 de octubre de mil quinientos veinte años. De vuestra sacra majestad muy humilde siervo y vasallo que los muy reales pies y manos de vuestra alteza besa. Fernán Cortés.

Después de ésta, en el mes de marzo primero que pasó vinieron nuevas de la dicha Nueva España, cómo los españoles habían tomado por fuerza la grande ciudad de Temixtitan, en la cual murieron más indios que en Jerusalén judíos en la destrucción que hizo Vespasiano; ya así mismo había en ellas más número de gente que en la dicha ciudad santa. Hallaron poco tesoro, a causa que los naturales lo habían echado y sumido en las lagunas. Sólo doscientos mil pesos de oro tomaron, y quedaron muy fortalecidos en la dicha ciudad los españoles, de los cuales hay al presente en ella mil quinientos peones y quinientos de caballo; y tienen más de cien mil indios de los naturales de la tierra en el campo en su favor. Son cosas grandes y extrañas, y es otro mundo sin duda, que de sólo verlo tenemos harta codicia los que a los confines de él estamos.

Estas nuevas son hasta principio de abril de mil quinientos veintidós años, las que acá tenemos dignas de fe.1Embed"

y la razón por la que estoy aquí es
porque este es otro cuento

acerca de la variedad extraordinaria
que presenta la historia

y la forma en que va.

Y, como sabemos,
la variedad es la sal de la vida,
o, en este caso, de la muerte,

porque esta historia particular
busca la forma

de cómo se inició
una serie de guerras

porque allá por la Edad Media
las personas cometían asesinato

por apoderarse de cualquier cosa
que les volara la cabeza.

Hablo de especias, por supuesto.

Cosas explosivas, como esta.

""PICKLE PICANTE""

Cada año
los turcos conmemoran 1453,

cuando tomaron a Estambul
de los cristianos
y clausuraron
el gran agujero

donde los cruzados, en su camino
a Oriente Medio,

pasaban la noche
para divertirse un poco.

Y si usted era un caballero
con una o dos noches libres,

entonces esta ciudad era el lugar
para un poco de sofisticación,

Y por eso, mientras saboreaban
estos deleites locales,

algunos de esos cruzados
desarrollaron otros gustos aquí.

Hablo de la comida,
porque una vez que habían saboreado

una innovación asombrosa,
las llamadas especias,
la comida de casa nunca
volvió a ser lo mismo.

La moda instantánea
que se extendió por toda Europa

de las especias de Oriente que
usted podía comprar aquí

impulsó el equivalente medieval
de los cárteles y guerras de droga de hoy,

porque usted sabe cómo cambia
el precio de una droga

desde que deja a un productor
hasta que llega a la calle.

Bien, lo mismo ocurría

con la pimienta,
la canela y el jengibre medievales,

sólo para Columbia,
léase el sudeste de Asia,

que es donde arribaban
las especias medievales.

Así que esa toma turca aquí en 1453

le cortó a Europa
el suministro de especias...

la causa real del comienzo
del colonialismo occidental,

porque uno tras otro,

holandeses, españoles, franceses,
portugueses e ingleses

marcharon hacia el Oriente
para conseguir sus propias especias

en lugar de negociar a través
de los nuevos intermediarios turcos.

Porque para ese tiempo
en que el consumidor europeo

tomaba las especias y hierbas del Oriente

con todo el abandono
de un alcohólico en una cervecería,

estábamos enganchados.

Y usted sabe lo que dicen
acerca de los adictos:

quieren que todo el mundo lo sea,

que finalmente fue lo
que sucedió.

Pero para entonces, la razón
ya no era la pimienta.

Era el té.

A finales de 1800
nosotros los británicos estábamos importando,

oh, 18 millones de libras al año,
en su mayor parte de China.

Se inventó
la gran hora británica del té,

dejando sólo el asunto sin importancia
de cómo obtener el dinero

para pagar las
18 millones de libras de té.

La solución: las drogas.

Pero esta vez, drogas reales
de las amapolas de la India

que era lo que había en ese momento.

Todo lo que se necesitaba era un mercado para ellas.

Bueno, dado que estábamos intentando
encontrar dinero para comprar té de China,

qué sorpresa tan irónica,

China estaba ya llena
de guaridas ilegales de opio.

Así que ahí estaban todos esos adictos para abastecer,

y pagando nuestro té
con su hábito desafortunado,

estos tipos solucionarán
el problema de la balanza de pagos británica,

porque estábamos sin efectivo

gracias a que gastamos
todas nuestras reservas de oro

en una guerra
contra Napoleón.

¿Y los adictos?

Bajas colaterales económicas, ¿no?

Así que ahora tenemos todas estas provechosas

guaridas de opio llenas de humo,
haciéndonos montones de dinero precioso,

el truco es mantener
a toda la estafa funcionando.

y para hacer eso,
tenemos que estar seguros

que podemos mantener
abierta la ruta comercial de China,

y para eso
necesitamos una cosa más.

Le daré una pista.

Cantinero, ¿puede servir
otra ronda, por favor?

Gracias.

De acuerdo, he aquí otra pista.

La tiene a la vista.

Esto.

Este es el famoso Long Bar
en el hotel

llamado como el hombre que nos trajo
esta otra cosa.

Allí está.

Él fue uno de los pocos

burócratas imperiales británicos
del siglo 19

que se tomó la molestia
de aprender el dialecto local.

Vivía como un lugareño,
vestía como un lugareño.

Hasta comía como un lugareño.

Extraordinario,
pero pareció funcionar.

Después de algunos años aquí
en el Oriente

había hecho
tan buena reputación

que Londres le pidió que tome Java
de los holandeses, así que lo hizo.

Se convirtió en teniente gobernador.

Y en su camino a Java
recibió

un informe detallado sobre
un basurero sucio y abandonado

que pertenecía a algún sultán local.

Así que a cambio de armas
y, qué más, un poco de opio,

nos consiguió un arrendamiento a largo plazo
del lugar,

que iba a ser perfecto
para conservar un ojo

en el cercano Estrecho de Malasia

a través del cual pasaba
nuestro comercio con China,

manteniendo por consiguiente todo
el negocio del té-por-opio

bien y seguro.

¿Oh, quién es nuestro héroe?

Sir Stamford Raffles.

¿y el basurero sucio y abandonado
que alquiló por opio?

Bueno, está un poquito cambiado desde entonces.

Es Singapur.

Entretanto,
Raffles y la selva de Java,

donde él pasaba la mayor parte de su tiempo
como teniente gobernador

administrando la iluminada
justicia británica

y agarrando el oro,
los diamantes, el café, la teca, la pimienta,

la seda, el té, el azúcar, el estaño, y el opio

que los lugareños parecían
no necesitar mucho.

Sin mencionar lo otro
que enloquecía a Raffles:

la naturaleza en cualquier modo o forma
que se presentara

doquiera que él estuviera.

Si se movía, él lo desecaba, lo rellenaba
o lo embotellaba.

En un solo viaje por la selva,
30 toneladas de eso.

Usted nómbrelo,
Raffles lo coleccionaba.

Y bastante más
que usted no puede nombrar.

Supongo que era como
la mayoría de los tipos coloniales.

Quería llevar
todas estas cosas exóticas

de regreso a casa en Inglaterra
y clasificarlas.

Y todo porque en 1802
como todos los demás a la sazón

había sido animado hacia la naturaleza

por un vicario inglés
por otro lado completamente olvidable

llamado William Paley,

que vivía en el medio de ninguna parte
al norte de Inglaterra

y que había tenido uno
de esos pensamientos felices

que se volvió un cliché instantáneo.

Él dijo, ""un reloj de pulsera no ocurre
por accidente.

""Tiene un propósito,
montones de partes operando conjuntamente

""diseñadas para hacerlo.

""Lo mismo con la naturaleza:

""montones de partes operando conjuntamente,
diseñadas para hacerlo

por el gran diseñador en el cielo"".

Este acercamiento científico de Paley

a la religión y la creación y todo eso
tuvo un éxito muy grande.

Él desarmó la naturaleza
como usted lo haría con un reloj de pulsera,

buscando el propósito de Dios
en el diseño.

Así que las patas con membranas
encajaban en un ave acuática.

Un ala grande para vuelos largos
y un cuello largo para alimentarse de abajo,

con un pico plano
para excavar comida de plantas acuáticas.

Cuando usted junta
todas esas partes construidas especialmente

usted obtiene el único diseño
que puede corresponder a este animal:

un cisne.

Entonces personas como Raffles paseaban
buscando especímenes

de este mundo de diseñador
de que hablaba Paley

y luego los coleccionaban
a todos conjuntamente

en versiones en pequeña escala
de plan grandioso de Dios.

Modernas arcas de Noé, si usted quiere.

Los llamamos zoológicos.

Así empezaron los zoológicos.

En este caso, uno de los primeros,
el London Zoo,

establecido con el solo propósito
de obtener una mirada cercana

a la naturaleza
bajo condiciones controladas

y estudiar el plan de Dios
y también, en este caso,

dar un lugar donde Raffles
pudiera ubicar su colección

cuando se retirase de su trabajo en Java
y regresara a Inglaterra en 1824.

Tres años después,
se abrieron las puertas-

sólo para miembros, por supuesto-

de la London Zoological Society,
o arca de Noé

con Raffles como su presidente

gracias a un camarada influyente suyo

un muy respetado
científico británico llamado Davy,

cuya sola contribución
a la zoología hasta ese momento

había sido hacer la vida
del canario uno poco más fácil.

Vea, en aquel entonces,
la única forma que un minero tenía de saber

cuando había peligroso
metano alrededor de él en la mina

era cuando el canario
que llevaba en una jaula

caía de su percha.

¿Una mejor forma?

Davy encontró
que el metano necesitaba

una alta temperatura
para hacerle explotar

así que básicamente diseñó una lámpara
que se mantenía fría.

Usted obtenía toda la luz que necesitaba
de la mecha ardiente,

pero él la rodeó
con una tela metálica fina

que contenía
el calor de la llama

y conservaba la temperatura
exterior de la lámpara baja

bajo la marca que haría
estallar el metano.

Probaron este diseño en dos

de las minas explosivas más peligrosas
de Inglaterra, y funcionó.

Y como Davy era ya
Sir Humphry Davy,

con medallas de Napoleón y
miembro de la Royal society,

nadie tomó en cuenta a
un don nadie que diseñaba minas

llamado Stephenson,

que dijo que había inventado una lámpara
tan buena como la de Davy.

Los financistas de Stephenson
estaban tan molestos

que le dieron
un premio de consolación de £ 1000,

afortunadamente para quienquiera
que guste de viajar en trenes.

Ese don nadie ingeniero de minas
los hizo posibles.

¿Usted recuerda la forma en que los británicos
manipulamos el comercio de opio al Oriente

para hacer bastante dinero
para pagar el té

y luego nos sobró bastante
para financiar la guerra

que estábamos peleando contra Napoleón?

Bueno, uno de las otras cosas
que esa guerra hizo

fue disparar tasas de inflación
realmente altas.

De modo que los mineros ingleses estaban desesperados

por una forma más barata
de transportar su carbón

que la tirada por caballos,

porque el precio de pienso del caballo
había subido como un cohete,

y lo que ese desconocido
ingeniero que mencioné,

George Stephenson, inventó fue lo
que solucionó el problema.

Titular de primera página.

""Rocket"" es el nombre que le dió Stephenson
a su nueva máquina maravilla

que transportaría carbón
y cambiaría al mundo.

Le llamamos locomotora.

Para obtener la mayor presión de vapor posible
de la caldera

la transformó en
una serie de tuberías

para recoger el máximo calor del fuego
y producir más vapor

para conducir los pistones
en los cilindros,

angulados de modo que se acoplarían directamente
a manivelas en las ruedas.

""El 8 de octubre de 1829"",
dice aquí,

""en Rainhill en la nueva
línea Manchester-Liverpool,

miles vinieron para
la gran carrera de máquinas de vapor"".

Estaban viendo
cuatro locomotoras competidoras

por el premio serio
que en dinero de hoy

sería medio millón de dólares.

Bueno, la ""Rocket"" de George Stephenson
ganó sin problemas.

Interesantemente,
este artículo no menciona

lo que sucedió con el tipo

que diseñó la locomotora
que llegó última.

Él dejó los ferrocarriles,
se fue de Inglaterra, fue a Nueva York.

Su nombre era John Ericsson,

y cuando comenzó la guerra civil
en 1861, escribió a Lincoln,

diciéndole que él sabía que Lincoln quería
bloquear los puertos sureños

para detener la exportación sureña
de algodón con que pagaban la guerra

y que él, Ericsson, podría diseñar

el tipo de barco
que podía hacer eso.

Tendría
una torreta giratoria encima.

Iría tan poco por encima del agua que
casi sería un submarino.

Y estaría cubierto
de una armadura enchapada de proa a popa.

Lincoln intentó esta idea alocada

y el ""Monitor"" de Ericsson
se hizo un prestigio

después de que hundió el barco acorazado más fino,
del Sud, el ""Merrimack"".

El ""Monitor"", de hierro fundido,
hizo del bloqueo

de los puertos sureños
una certeza férrea

una vez que el Norte estableció una cabeza de puente
detrás de las líneas enemigas aquí en Port Royal

en una de las Islas del Mar
fuera de la costa de Carolina del Sur.

Aquí, Washington estableció uno de
los programas de asistencia social más inusuales

en la historia de los Estados Unidos.

Se divulgó
como el experimento de Port Royal,

y dio a los negros la propiedad de la tierra,

les otorgó derechos,

y la oportunidad de formar
su gobierno local.

...es hora de
que repasásemos lo de la semana pasada.

Pero la parte más radical
del experimento

era conducida por una mujer, una maestra

que abrió la primera escuela pública
para los hijos de esclavos

para enseñarles las habilidades básicas
de aritmética, lectura,

y, sobre todo, escritura.

...sabemos que todavía tenemos
que practicar nuestras letras

y trabajar en esas letras
y hoy haremos la ""M"".

Una ""M"" es una letra muy fácil;
son como dos montañas...

A la larga el experimento falló.

Después de la guerra, las cosas regresaron
a la forma en que fueron,

y todo el mundo volvió
a cultivar algodón en Sea Island.

A fines del siglo 19,
Sea Island tenía el control

del mercado de algodón de lujo
por todo Europa,

y a los inversores
les iba tan bien

en la creciente industria del gas de alumbrado.

Muy bien.

Ahora, había una sola cosa
que podía aguar la fiesta

a los inversionistas
de gas de alumbrado del siglo 19

y era la invención
de la luz eléctrica.

Pero afortunadamente para este programa,
eso no es cómo va la historia siempre.

No son siempre lámparas nuevas por viejas.

Los fabricantes de gas de alumbrado
se salvaron de la electricidad

por un austríaco llamado Welsbach,

que consiguió un título aristocrático
por su trabajo

y tomó como su lema familiar
""Más luz"".

¿Quiere adivinar por qué?

Bien, Welsbach hizo una luz de gas
mucho más brillante

que con un truco todavía usamos

en las luces de acampada
como estas.

En 1885, Welsbach rodeó
la llama del gas con un manto

hecho de algodón de Sea Island

impregnado con un material
que se ponía incandescente,

como todas estas.

Pero el manto de Welsbach
aún no era lo suficientemente brillante

para competir con las bombillas.

Entonces él probó varios mantos
hechos de minerales diversos

que hacían lo mismo-
unos minerales llamados tierras raras.

Hacían el manto más brillante aun
que la luz eléctrica.

Y mientras Welsbach
estaba perdiendo el tiempo

con sus tierras raras
descubrió uno nuevo.

Lo llamó neodimio,
que es bastante más anonadador

de lo que usted pudiese pensar

y al cual regresaré
después de una corta pausa teatral.

Nos encontramos con la señorita Georgia Cayvan,
la mayor estrella de Broadway de los 1880s.

Caliente en más de un sentido,
como también sus audiencias veraniegas.

La gerencia del teatro hizo lo mejor posible

con abanicos que soplaban aire
a través de bloques de hielo

para controlar la temperatura, igual como
estaban haciendo los fabricantes de algodón.

Las fábricas lo llamaron ""acondicionamiento"",

y el nombre de su juego era

mantener la temperatura y humedad
perfectas para el hilado de algodón.

Miss Cayvan resolvió
ambos problemas a la vez.

Bueno, su vestido lo hizo.

Hasta donde yo sé,
sólo se hicieron dos-

uno para Miss Cayvan y el otro
para una princesa española-

por una compañía en Toledo.

Este Toledo, en Ohio,
no Toledo de España.

Y por esta vez
la compañía no tuvo que preocuparse

por obtener el tipo correcto
de aire acondicionado para estas fibras,

porque el vestido
estaba hecho de vidrio.

Ahora, uno de los tipos
en la fábrica de vidrio de Toledo a la sazón

era un tipo llamado Michael Owens,

que vino a fundar una de
las compañías más grandes de vidrio en América

y luego ayudó a hacer los días calientes
en lugares de vacaciones

un poco más tolerables,
porque en 1935

estaba desarrollando la siguiente etapa
de la lana de vidrio: la fibra de vidrio.

Que resultó ser ideal
para conservar frescas de cosas -merci-

o calientes, porque la fibra de vidrio
podía aguantar cualquier cosa

desde 500
hasta menos 300 grados Fahrenheit.

Así que resolvió el aire acondicionado
y los problemas de aislamiento de todos los tipos,

lo que nos lleva, como dije antes,
al neodimio.

¿Recuerda a Welsbach
y todos sus mantos?

Bueno, gracias a él
y su neodimio

había ahora alguna otra cosa
que hacer con fibra de vidrio:

la guerra.

En los 1960s, todos los militares
estaban interesados en vidrio muy puro

y lo que pasaría
al meter neodimio en él.

Un campo magnético
excita los átomos de neodimio,

así que cuando usted les da luz

se recargan
y emiten su energía excedente

en un rayo de luz increíblemente intenso
tan estrecho y poderoso,

que alcanzará hasta la luna

o puede hacer daño a gran distancia como este.

A fines de los 80s

el láser estaba haciendo cosas
que parecían de Buck Rogers.

Durante la Guerra del Golfo

los pilotos podían iluminar un blanco
con un rayo láser

y luego guiar una bomba inteligente
en la trayectoria del rayo

con resultados espectaculares.

Y por eso es que comencé aquí
en el mercado de especias de Estambul,

porque un montón de esos
que activaron las antenas de la Guerra del Golfo se fueron

de las bases aéras aquí en Turquía,

y cuando llegaron
hasta donde fueron enviados

armaron sus explosivos láser

y se aprestaron a hacer
lo que habían venido a hacer,

girar un interruptor
y liberar las bombas.

¿Y usted sabe
cómo llaman a ese interruptor

cuándo está armado
y su artillería está lista?

Y'all are crazy, dude

You wanna go to war? Huh? Okay, I'll take you to war
I'ma do like what they do
Diss people before the big event happens, and kill 'em
Hear the shockwave
[Verse 1]
Time to separate the men from the boys
Cyberized threats is what I'm sending through my voice
Calling out JJ, Deji, Logan, and his little bitch
Which is Fake Paul, and the Asian Jake Paul
Ricе is softer than a blow-up chick
You're Buklau with a really small dick
Y'all arе nothing but careless rich kids
Don't worry, all you bitches are on my shit list
Five motherfuckers I wanna put in the ground
(Four) minutes and this shit will be flipped around
(Three) strikes will knock you all down
(Two) personalities that share the same crown
I live to kill and breed off of intel
Going to war with an exoskeleton trojan helm
In this fight, it's legal to go below the belt
When I rap like this, I don't need no help
I can try proofreading your bars if you like
The same shitty style y'all share to rhyme
One was bullshit, one was bias
One was garbage, and one was a lie
Since the Sting Zone, there was a lotta fish I fried
I spit it sincerely on every diss with pride
A digital buffet for me whenever I fly by
Hell, I can beat all of you at the same in your prime
I'm a killer, The RiceGum Scraper
The Paul Decapitator, The Bounty Hunter Hunter
I'm realer, The Keemstar Exploder
The JJ Slapper, The Deji Punta
Jakes I fuck with is the Snake and Gyllenhaal
The douchebag, Paul, makes me take a Tylenol
A license and diploma, he can buy it all
Except for love, in which brought you into all the triangles
A bad rapper acting like a brat with anger
You look like a discount clearance Jack Swagger
Your coach did a service by snitching to the media
Taking pills that gets you ripped and beefed up
That fight money's going towards your medical bills
You keep starting fights, motherfucker, you better chill
You should be called The 99+ Problem Child
'Cause there is no reason for you to keep being wild
Logan, you keep getting your ass kicked like a hoe
You should have left YouTube years ago
Goodbye LP, you're nothing but a joke
Dissed Antonio Brown and you didn't go for broke
Rice, you better get your wack shit off of YT
Why are you claiming shit that we find hard to believe?
You see 6 colors in the spectrum, I see 15
Your stupid ass should be working at IC 16
What is the Clout Gang? Not a gang in YT
Bang on Twitter but won't bang in YT
Unreasonable beefs is what you feed on
The most dangerous YouTuber ever since Onision
I've went back to back on KSI
I bet he didn't read his record contract and still signed it
You on auto tune sucks ass, so
Why do you look like Hopsin from Picasso?
I'll pay the referee to keep you on your feet
Make the fight last longer and sweep you off your feet
Strip off your pride, manhood, belt, and tattoos
I've already let the diss go when I'm aiming at you
Proteges are meant to be taught, not a prodigy
If I wanted shitty bars, I go prod Deji
Lyrically, I have the knowledge, strength, and integrity
I'll beat your ass worse than a 64 palm from Neji
I'm building tension with tom-tom drums
Sending ash and dust after a megaton crush
Say your last prayers before hell spreads upon us
'Cause when the best bomb comes, it's time for Defcon 1

Kept battling each other overseas and locked in a stalemate
150 million degree heat within the radial blaze
Melt your faces away along with your insatiable pain

You'll end up working for EA as an associate
A real artist putting you as a feature is a big mistake

If you wanna dismantle me from my throne, come do it
You can't be king with that bullshit in your music
You gotta lift a gun up to get street cred
Pursue gang gang any further and you're never gonna sleep again
Jake, you're a pussy, a fake, a liar, and a stan
You think you're tough? You can't even write your own raps
What kind of person copyrights himself?
You dropped out of high school and college, same for your brother as well
You fucking dummy, what happened to Team 10?
Since you wanna be the man, I guess you don't need 'em
""Erika's a beautiful soul and truly changed my life,"" he said
Went from a rotten teenager to a fully-grown blonde meathead

You can't fight, we already figured that out
Beast wanted to scrap and all you did was back down

To be honest, you're more of a complete slut than they are
Multiple children is something you can't afford
Once your position goes sideways, you're paying child support
Your brother gave you the fame, you ain't soak it
You're supposed to share the success, not boast it
Even Logan's sitcom sucked as bad as Airplane Mode did
He's dead to the court for 3 mil from a video he chose to submit
The clock tick-tocks when I'm coming for you
The biggest manchild on YT, they're all making fun of you
You are rhyme-less without your swag and pay stacks
Even with a brain transplant, you'll still see the world gray and black
Now, back to Rice, I'm not finished battering you
You're a disgrace as an Asian and a cancer to YouTube
Every disaster is a subject you can banter to
W2S challenged you and we're still waiting for an answer soon
How many bridges you've burned just to get views?
How many bitches you've spurred just to let loose?
You resigned to title father and the integrity you returned to
Your character is so absurd, even your own country deserts you
Break out the tin foil hats, I believe there's a conspiracy
It's up to you if you believe it or not like Robert Ripley
I always keep tabs on y'all like bees imposing as spies

Quer autógrafo, holofote com 1° de abril
Nas peruas do DRE incinerando cocaína

Nunca teve a sensação do pé mexendo o dedo
Na perna amputada por um tiro abaixo do joelho
Vem assistir a Telefunken de madeira preto e branco
Chamar de lar quatro tapume no barranco
Só ter futuro catando a Frontier da colunista
Pra fazer treta em pó na Bolívia
Canto pra um dia andar no carro por nós projetado
Ver o DVD com a patente do favelado

E aqui na favela, desempregado
Pai de família que só queria ter comida nos pratos
Dos filhos sem ter que buscar cego de febre o açougue
Ou a padaria da vila de BIKE com uma 12""
É loco né tru, pensamento retrogado
Efeito diabólico que trás nas lembranças velório
Choros, saudades de quem partiu dessa vida loca
Na cadeia ou na rua invadindo a mansão de toca
Metendo bala, trocando com a ROTA sem dó
Pra família ver na tv morto no b.ó
Mais um filho de uma pobre coitada que chora
- chora...mais uma pobre senhora
Pois é, pra você vê que não é peça de teatro
A história me mostra que o crime não é rosas não é fácil
Olhar pra frente e caminhar sem nenhum arranhão
No vale da escuridão...
[Verso 2]
O mundo é triste né hé, puta que pariu
O foda é sabe que sou descartável que nem BOMBRIL
Num sistema que me faz de lixo me oferece um Cristo
Pregado na cruz, sangrando numa coroa de espinhos
Meu salvador não se encontra de cabeça baixa
Pelo contrario, a dor do calvário me trás fé na graça
Nunca só, acompanhado de um exército
De porto alegre a Brasília em todos hemisférios
Mas perai até hoje eu não entendo
Sofredor eu já nasci maquiavélico desde cedo
Pelo ódio que me guia e o amor pela favela
Pela luz que me ilumina e a morte que me espera
Aqui estou derrepente, humildemente sendo cordial
Talvez paranormal, de instinto, fenomenal
Veja só óh! os boy de classe média não falava:
Rap Deus me livre lugar de preto é na senzala
O tempo passa né, hé o mundo roda
Hoje eles pagam pal e diz que nóis é foda
Bandido se eu to no trafico então ave bak
Dando rolê da NISSAN braço gordo tem um infarte
Mais não, demonio dá com uma mão e tira com as 2
Por isso que eu faço a minha sem cresce zoio na sua
E vou preparado pro que der e vier
É ou não é pra surpresa de muitos ainda to de pé
Eu só queria que meus truta entendesse
Que o inimigo é aquele que passeia de MERCEDEZ
Fumando charuto cubano na costa do SAUÍPE
E não os moleque de 15"" que carrega os rifle
Pois é queria ta errado e que tudo fosse ilusão
Que fosse apenas fruto da imaginação
Sobreviver na selva sem nenhum arranhão
No vale da escuridãoYou might also likeEmbed"

""Des femmes descendant de leur miroir ancien

T'apportent leur jeunesse et leur foi en la tienne

Et l'une sa clarte la voile qui t'entraine

Te fait secretement voir le monde sans toi
-o-

C'est avec nous que tout vivra.""

Paul Eluard....Paris: 1926


**************************

As desire relaxes its once furtive grasp into appreciation....and that looked to is seen so

vividly in the light far traveled entering our morning window..... and as you lay so still asleep with eyes closed softly in dreampassion remembrance......I read slowly to you...

""Women coming down from their ancient mirror

Bringing their youth and their faith in yours...""

A ceaseless snow morning and I for the longest time without touching stroke your face with soft looking
and then one hand into warmth unseen beneath pale silk and you so slightly move. ...
Remembrance thoughts of lovemaking before sleep intertwine themselves with the details of
freshly lit incense on my senses........the sounds of your even, still breathing punctuate the silence....
if only one could hold a single moment in life's time it would be this first awakening sunrise moment,  as you lie so still asleep....... dreaming...

""And one her light the sail which leads you off

Helps you secretly see the world without you...""
I look to a bedside broken mirror reflecting only and for always the flow of present time
with no memory recalled of our passionwalk up the silverglass that night and the look of surprise
in your pleased with broken reflection eyes as minds halted into disbelief laughter...
now,  etched so vividly in this first of morning mind is the midnight candleglow beauty
of your milkskin tenderness ways and scents, softfold delicate petals of skin...

""-o-

It is with us that everything will live.""


**************************

Deepest winter and snowing heavily in these mountain pines as I read the Eluard...
that ancient mirror in the Paris of 1926, he must have known the moments clearly ....
the Emperor's mirrorview at Ise...

Wildflowers drying in a celadon window... colours revealed as remaining moisture captures this first light of day.......beauty fades into the yugen beyond form, then softly disappears...

**************************


I committed to the teachings in July of  1969 in the Sangre de Christo mountains near Taos, New Mexico, as the result of conversations with an elderly landscape painter named Herman Reznick, a Christian yogin with a very big mind who left it up to me to find a clear path and to not be confused by charlatans. We sat those long crimson New Mexico seasky summer evenings on the western view slope of those beautiful mountains, warm pinion air breezing hauntingly soft...breath slow minds focused on dry distant horizons...slow, end of sunlight... talking...


Oil painting days, strong summer colours

Mixed in the mind with riverbank clays,

Dried bone whites along high mountain trails,

The hues of a soft brilliant sky.

Vision deepening...

Colours and scents

Worked through the fingertips

Of a long, still gaze...


Phenomena seem as translucent flow,

Unreal yet visible, floating ... thatness

In the oceanmind world we swim.




At the Pueblo de Taos, white sage summer dances with slow ritual movement ... the elders motionless in their blankets bright woven and the adobe children with their deep,  darkened eyes in wonderland play with laughter voices...red earth dust on their feet, lips soft as cottonwood seed. To the the west hours distant, pastel thunderhead clouds and into the east, highland green mountains with sacred spirit lakes and crystalline drala caves.

As the edge of day's light fading quickly into darkness the wildflowers return softly into their glow, pinion and juniper scents grow fainter, then slowly disappear. Bloodwarm animals move ghostlike from shade into shadow. An aging desert coyote poet speaks his mind then dissolves slowly into the  yellow.

Mind moves...the high desert lies quietly for centuries.


**************************


Child's mind is beginningless and has no end with the light and colour shapes of imagination play darknesses opening into a continuous present childtime so preconception rich with laughter and short sadnesses and tears-love-pain so vividly woven into abstraction days of stormpassing yellows and shy vermilion desire  heart-touched now to a remembered soft blue and as one grows older the illusions of goal and fascination with speed erode the sensibilities and benumb the feelings, nourishing the chasm  that develops between who in reality we are and what in thought illusion we pretend to be. Conceptualization obscures basic perception and we become preoccupied lost in a blackened fog of impotent literary materialism with the childwonder corrupting into superficial distraction, continuously falling, deeply fading falling into the depths of  a convinced self-solidity.

Cool blue and fragile green

Dappled sapphire

Dot in white space

Spins aimlessly thru vastness

Warmed by a powerful ruby sun.

Southwest desert sunrise

(Blood of Christ Mountains)

A tiny brilliant rose-amber spider

Climbs a sparkled glistening web

Seeking shelter in soft morning shadows.

There came a place on the dreamwater stream

Where I began to see further.


**************************


I returned that autumn to San Francisco to study Zen with Suzuki Roshi, whom I had met previously yet couldn't particularly figure out. Cut the blonde hair short and rode 5 am streetcars through alone darkened streets to the Bush Street shrineroom with its stark shadow outlines and incense scent staircase creaking and sat the difficult sunrise morning hours silently watching the edges of discursive minds  exhausting gently into themselves. Studied the flower and tea rituals, cut the arrogant branches, wondered of his theory of time and beauty and came so close....

The young  Tibetan came to teach in the summer of 1970 and he was relaxed fresh, unpredictable...and I sat close very zenlike in complete fascination of his mind and manner and finally discovered my true heart...went to see him a few days later  and he was drunk and I walked away in disappointment and swirled for days in confusion then finally decided to find out what was me and what was him.

Having seen your face

And heard your soft voice

Watched you slowly limpwalk into the room...

Glimpses of openness suddenly occurred

And what always seemed me

Softened into yearning...

A young man with a corpse on his back

Proceeds slowly eastward

Through the phenomenal swirl.


**************************


Stillness until one slight awakening stir,

And out an opened window the beauty of slowly falling snow.

The pines grow bluer in the shadow light of this storm...

Pearldust drala wonderland.


Morning alone,  exploring the details of crimson on candlelit brocade as I practice
with the brush then offer the morning tea and the two visualizations and remembered
incantations with the blackstroke ink dissolving down the central crystal channel
to the white heart projecting and awakening all the while to the inviting white smoke
of dried juniper rising into the windsongs of sky galloping horses and the snow...
the snow still falling...perfectly slowly falling...dissolving...
rising, swirling, striving, purling, falling...melting...


this landscape binds into a refulgent crystalling splendor...

binding, falling, dissolving, rising...
life, and death too, are both good.


**************************


I left for Colorado and spent the weeks walking clear mountain streams and driving backcountry roads drinking with young, pretty companions and as always the endless craziness developed and dissolved and how often you came to mind...how affectionately the images arose...

Early October...the radio and writing

Out an open window...patches of snow up the mountainside

Sky: clear and blue like ordinary mind.

Pine trees and streams, rocks...Yun.

Last night a full moon too beautiful to speak about

Today, relaxed and thinking of you...

The flow of a  gentle warmth through these veins

Geomantic completeness...empty heart.

Slowly falling snow through a dream morning window...senses exploring senses,  mind training mind....then unexpectedly, one timeless pause in the absolute center of completely centerless space.


**************************

I unexpectedly met him standing alone late one summer night in Boulder on a darkened downtown street with the people busily passing and for the first time it occurred to me how alone he must have been in this world with that mind of his and as the years have passed that understanding has deepened,  along with others... Only a fool shields himself with softness.

In a crystalline shallow pool

Deep in some distant mountains

A brilliantly golden fish

Swims wavely perfect in aloneness.

Able to speak...there is no one to listen

Surrounded by steep, rocky  cliffs

The clear, pure water can't flow

To the faraway sea.

Lonely for his true parents

This flower of the dream-water

Prepares to fly...


**************************


In the winter of 1981 I spent three months on a large group meditation retreat at Chateau Lake Louise, deep in the Canadian Rockies. During the third difficult day of gently persistent outbreath sitting meditation  I completely lost ground...began swimming in a quicksand like mind of confusion, murky and bottomless with  a complete swirling and the tremendous energy surging and the perceptual world without any solidity. My body was no longer clearly defined with the boundaries of skin to which I had grown accustomed and I had to take long, cold showers in to return to a more solid state. I learned from those quicksand days not to panic ...  regardless of what occurred,  nor to push my way through. Each moment required complete focus.

As those days and nights of terror/wonder passed, the sandvision turbulence clarified gradually into an ocean of energy which flowed into,  through and about and never for an instant was one separate ... with the soft touch out breath dissolving gently into space without texture ... and the steep mental climbs past rockcloud bound kleshas and finally the relaxed soar into mind brilliant blue sky ... that tremendous shock of blue...

A very strong connection with the earth had begun to occur and I could always feel the incredibly powerful energy flowing up through my very heavy feet...

Dream/past   dream/present   dream/future.....

Awakening from a lifedream of confusion,

Feet painlessly nailed to this powerful earth...

And whatever these days I write for you

Is a giftstone tossed to a surfaceless sea,

Playful waves polishingly churning...

Ghostdance sailors of the golden-butter sea .......


**************************


Deep into that  blue/glacier winter, powerful experiences continued to occur. Late one night morning as he spoke I began to experience an extremely vivid mirror-like reality and from the center of that exploding perception brightness he smiled a go further look and suddenly with a tremendous jolt the body completely dissolved and there I sat in gone-out wonder nodding gently that I finally understood the precious mind of the lineage and all the while I felt like ancient Tilopa sitting alone unseen in complete reality madness on the banks of a farago river ...  riverrun.

The world we look into is a shadowcave mirror

Platonic dreamplay puppets

Projected by the heart mind resting nowhere in stillness.


Reflections impossible to grasp, taste, even touch...

Nothing listening to nothing, nothing happening to see.

Died alive Johnny ... Blue eyes breathing fire

Heartblood gushing through central vein channels.


Into that mirror without any dust

There is nothing left nothing ...

Nothing to say.

I walked the empty Chateau Lake Louise corridors deep into that sleepless night somewhat past aloneness and all the while felt so very sensitive to the softer light worlds of the dead.  Sat alone until dawn at the glacier view window in a candleglow appreciation of the richness and patience of the lineage, and the ocean-mind world which was sensed but unseen until that alone luminous night.

**************************


The return to Colorado was extremely difficult with all the mechanical energy and people along the street glued to their senses, mindlessly drawn along from one shop window to another.  Eyes away cold on faces with no light and I as usual with so little to say walked the day slowly through movie streets,  watching...

Sitting motionless...bones harden into rock...

Mind pours into itself...senses achieve astonishing clarity...

Awareness without memory,  luminous vision with no expectation...

An indestructible essence is realized... there is no longer fear...

To taste again mind without any taste, to swim in its ocean of brilliance...

To touch the earth with these soft hands, mirror-hand-lines reminding...

To leave the stone footprints, for others to follow.

Two mirrors: no reflection...

First Trungpa, weeks later,  alive Blue Vajradhara.


**************************


Into the closing hours of this reverie room, naked feet warmed to a footprint stone floor, the fires of the earth slowly rising and from that which flows so mysteriously of mind unseen into the seed of  heart and through a whitened throat  with the words as blossoms and  then down a powerful arm, softstroked to the touch yet deep within a current of pure steelhardened energy... slow continuous to rockbone fingertips ... the words arising from a speechless silence.

Waiting downstream for the poetry boats of Li Po,

The brilliance of occurrence unfettered by sense organs.

Nothing comes.

Cool blue face with mirror reflection tears,

Eyes wetsparkling....Reality.

In an ocean of love there is no seduction...

The eyes won't turn away nor quiver

Yet the heart does ...  it has so little discipline.


**************************

Cremation Day.  Vermont

Spring cricket music fields edged by a fragile green forest

Birch and alder leaves blow softly across a pale blue sky

In a distant valley, woodcutters

Yet mostly silence, mostly beauty.

Back into  the forest, traces of white smoke continue skyward...

So many faces today

Awakening once again to an ocean of aloneness

I feel the breeze of your soft breath

Across my face and through the body

And vow to repay you.

On Viewing the Relics...Faceless face on a blackened charred head in airless bellglass so vividly seen yet more than a skull because there's so much burnt tissue,  especially inside with the right eye socket blown out so completely and the left with blackburnt bandages still ashened across it, a few hairs.... no lips, no nose, no tongue, nor ears nor eyes...unmistakable forehead...while across this same room a photo and I look back and forth from image to relic with such astonished wonder and such incredible sadness. The smiles will never come again, nor the jokes and complaints,  and no more poems from the firemelted lips.... the commands have all been given...

Coal blackened head with a memory face etched so completely in that Lake Louise mirror.  The soft, high voice with carefully arranged words uplifting with simply said things.  No longer a throat, the voice cords to white smoke.  Too real to look at, a presence so strong... and then bending sadly into one last farewell an invisible heavy hand comes down to bless.....Ki Ki So So


**************************


It was the Rigden's birthday poetry, nothing was to be eaten.  I sat in secret in the rocks above, August morning watching my sun child dive happily into torn tent openings.   A good place to die, I thought,  mind chained to these rocks undisturbed a few days with the roller coaster of elements quickly dissolving, earth body to water then fire into wind/space and whatever ... the softer light ones vermillion sky dancing... brilliant white  clouds......the Sun!

It's a Rilkian Inscape, the senses can come too...

With the poetry dancing it's touched naked appreciation...

Stormed palace lady of red ...

Oh mirrored Blue......

Above the relic plain, things settle themselves.


**************************


Having ridden the powerful breathhorse into the fourth time

and viewed Shambhala with it's gemstone streets and

brilliantly coloured forests and valleys...

Walked this earth with it's molten sunlike center

and for months carried it's powerful, nourishing  energy

in these incredibly heavy feet...

Then one day a glimpse of your soft eyes

in an unexpected meeting,  and my life is once again

abandoned to the madness of poetry...

I still remember that airplane view of toy cities and greenery. Oh, I was only 8-years-old but I remember well mixed feelings of excitement and being scared as hell

Our first year here must be the hardest of our lives—I've never seen my mother cry so many times. I remember that I always missed my dad, but we joked a lot, thank God for that
I'd get lost inside my mind when I'd start day dreaming—escape was my solution for just about everything

Is your life only what you want to, only what you want to believe?
Do you see only what you want to, only what you want yourself to see?
(Is this my life? 'Cause I've been so confused. My memory it lies to me, it's often of no use. Is this my life? 'Cause I've just gotten used to running from what bothers me and starting over new.)
But yet what would I be without my memory?

I remember I tried so hard to fit in and learn to speak this language fluently. Inside I never felt like part of the crowd and somehow knew that I could never be
I felt truly alive with paper and a pen, expressing my emotions vividly. And how I could put down what I couldn't say became a life sustaining part of me
'd get so lost inside the world I was creating, reality would disappear and so would everything
Chorus

Is your life only what you want to, only what you want to believe?
Do you see only what you want to, only what you want yourself to see?

In the blink of an eye, 22 years passed me by and left me what I am: someone that I'm still trying to understand
In the blink of an eye, a whole lifetime has left me with these choices that I've made and the consequences of my actionsYou might also likeEmbed"

But I sat so still and just waited there for you

With a focused look you headed towards the corner and I ran like a child after you
And I can't remember words that I was saying while you put the night in picture frames

You were taking photographs while I hovered by your side
So you can catch this night on film and I can keep it in my mind
You were taking photographs of lights and city life, while I just took it all in by your side

And the train ride home that night was spent in silence while you held my hand like we first met
And it hit me then, that we were both still children—afraid of letting go the hand we've held
So I held you close just like your photographs have held on to that night
And why be adults when it takes a child to forgive throughout this life?
And what matters most is that we're able to believe when all seems lost
So why be adults?

I hoped you'd come back for me, so I sat down and waited

The memories we've made they never really fade. And though we think we change, some parts just stay the same. We try so hard to just put everything away, forgetting who we are and how we got this way

And I'll admit right now that I took you for granted and I regret it. For what it's worth, I hope I've learned from my mistakes. For what it's worth I hope, I hope I…

Everyday I still think of you and all of the things you taught me. Remember that I believe in you and everything you were meant for. You've got so much heart inside you—
Don't let them take that away, don't ever forget where you came from

Fast, like the rhythms of the songs we used to play, the seasons passed and dragged us in our separate ways. Though we live differently, we both still think the same: we make the most of life and all it brings our way
And I'll admit right now that I took you for granted and I regret it. For what it's worth, I hope I've learned from my mistakes. For what it's worth I hope, I hope I…

When the words ""growing up"" feel like ""growing apart,"" the ones that we love will have changes of heart, and the lessons we've learned we just wish we'd forget, don't give up, don't regret, your life's not over yet
'Cause we've learned to believe in ourselves once again. And we've learned that we don't have to pretend. And I wish you the best because I'm still your friend. 'Cause I've learned to let go and I know that I can

Everyday I still think of you and all of the things you taught me. Remember that I believe in you and everything you were meant for
You've got so much heart inside you, yea you've got so much heart inside you
You've got so much heart inside you

So we waited yesterday but our lives begin this moment as cool ocean wind plays on sun-burnt skin. We've set out on sudden whims to give reason for our journey. We're grateful for what's been and it's meant everything to me

I feel so alive with you, my life. You are the air I breathe and I can't get enough

And don't you worry, the world will know our story. And it was written for you. And I will turn the darkest sky to fireworks of dreams come true

So let's drive on the roads made by imaginary lines. We'll leave the windows down tonight and we'll play all our favorite songs or maybe just enjoy the silence. We'll hear the summer wind whisper in our ears

You know now the reason you were brought down. Don't let it leave you. Don't let it leave you helpless and if you slow down, just take in this moment, I promise it will leave you. It will leave you breathless
Oh it will leave you. It will leave you breathless

The Graveyard Shift, Louisville and Jay City together on this bitch. Bukshot, N-Do, O.D., Gangsta Blac, Trig, Big Shawn, with them 812 Soulja'z, Ruff Side, Redrum, we taking this shit over

[Verse 1: Bukshot]
Bukshot the player hater, executer so fuck yo crew
Down with them thugs up across the bridge where the area code is 8-1-2
Straight up anybody killer, strapping the chopper that goes bang
Making sure outside is hangin', it's a Midwest thing
So you best done give respect up in this city I call mine
'Cause there won't be no hesitation to put hot lead where the sun don't shine
A frown up on my mug, prepare to lick a chaser from a chipe
'Cause I'm the one who blew 1-8-7 in yo pager
[Verse 2: ???]
Tonight is midnight, dressed in all black
Me and Buk and my cousin mobbin' Macklemore busting caps out the Lac
Throughout the Midwest, spitting on the concrete showing (fuck you nigga) no respect
After dumping on yo set, hit 75 West, through the bridge
Throw the guns over the rail, and to 812
Both of the bodies come up stained and the detector I smell
Ain't this something to creep to? Me and Bukshot blasting
No questions asking (kablow), your life is not lasting

[Verse 3: N-Do]
Now it's time to get wicked with Bukshot, N-Do, N-O-T
Coming straight to you like psycho, one psycho, two psycho, three
It's time I bleed up a storm, make it rain till you strain
Shooting caine up your veins till it's busting out your brain
It's a game that I likes to play, I'll torture, full shots in a minute
Got dead bodies in my cell like it's a motherfucking clinic
It's the scene that I'm in, but it's fucked so I continue
Eating Gushers, blood for sauce while I'm dipping in yo fingers

[Verse 4: ???]
Got my Mossberg letting off buckshots
Fuck yo Glocks, we mobbing in droptops
Serving on the West End blocks, blazing big weed
Keyed off the endoja

A.T.F. is on the prowl trying to get them my recipe
So I'm busting out this back door, got my gun in my hand
This Midwest Destroyer's about to make a stand

Mom and dad I'm coming to see ya if they lay me down to rest
I see you're closing in, they ready to peel my cap
But it's the Graveyard shift (you bitches) welcome to my trap
Y'all been praying for my downfall but the prey is on you
Sixteen killers on this song, your nightmares have come true

PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.









EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - DUSK

It's finally happened.  Hell's frozen over.

Christmas is two weeks off, arid SNOW is falling in Gotham.
Beneath its pristine white blanket, the city looks
uncharacteristically serene -- almost inviting.  Peace has
been miraculously restored: strangers wave hello.  Salvation
Army Santas ring their bells on streetcorners.  And now, as
night falls, an ILLUMINATED SIGN winks on above Broad Avenue:
""JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
Christmas.""

The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
wants more.

Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading ""AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
BATWING -- $19.95 and up.""  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt
with the familiar yellow-and-black logo.  In Gotham this
winter, Batmania is everywhere...
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Two hours later, the SNOWSTORM's grown into a full-fledged
blizzard.  The drifts are two feet deep and the streets are
all but empty of cars.  A massive SNOW PLOW the size of a
Panzer tank rumbles past, FILLING THE FRAME...

...and revealing, as it passes, a group of CAROLERS, all
bundled up in mufflers and parkas.  Unbothered by the weather,
they walk the street singing, spreading cheer and goodwill to
the few passersby.

They've just gone into a lovely a capella rendition of ""Silent
Night"" when an oversized DELIVERY TRUCK, outfitted with snow
chains, clanks slowly past in the wake of the plow.  Its sides
are decorated with cartoon igloos advertising a popular ice
cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time
of year.

A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck
as it rounds a corner.  The CAROLERS carol.  Then --

-- a VIOLENT EXPLOSION rocks the street -- followed by the
sound of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE and a high, wailing SECURITY ALARM.

EXT. SCHRACH AND CO. - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

Around the corner there's CARNAGE on the streets.  The windows
have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.

CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...

The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

SIRENS HOWL.  A POLICE CAR appears, taking the corner just a
trifle too fast -- FISHTAILING on the icy street and plowing
into a drift.

INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The COPS gun the engine, but their wheels are spinning in the
snow -- no traction.  They're about to climb out and give
chase on foot when, through the windshield, they see the
Salvation Army SANTA...

...HOISTING AN AK-47 AND FIRING DIRECTLY AT THEM.  The
windshield disintegrates and the COPS sink from view as SANTA
races off to the last of the snowmobiles, which is already
burdened with LOOT.

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

MORE SQUAD CARS converge on the jewelry store -- but it's
difficult to carry on a high-speed pursuit when the snow's a
foot deep and the best you can do is 6 MPH.  The COP CARS skid
to a halt, blocked by the rumbling SNOWPLOW.  By now, of
course, the LOOTERS are gone -- scooting off on either side of
the plow, sticking to the snowy sidewalks.

EXT. STREETS - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

SNOWMOBILES glide across the sidewalks, sending the few hardy
souls who are out on the streets DIVING FOR COVER.  A couple
of DERELICTS are cowering behind a fire hydrant, trying to
avoid getting run over.  Every time they poke their heads out,
another SKIDOO whizzes past, missing them by inches.

The ROBBERS fan out in various directions.  These guys are
obviously going to get away clean -- unless...

The DERELICT points up at the night sky, where a BEACON is
blazing in the darkness -- THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT...

INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

MORE SIRENS.  A COP takes a radio call as he streaks down the
long wide avenue which borders Gotham Park -- one of the few
streets which is relatively clear.  The COP at the wheel goes
wide-eyed and nudges his partner in disbelief.

Before their eyes, FIVE SNOWMOBILES appear from the cross
streets up ahead and CONVERGE at the entrance to Gotham Park.
Bringing up the rear is SANTA CLAUS.

COP
What the hell -- ?

EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BRAKES SQUEAL.  Several squad cars are now massed at the
entrance to the park -- but there's one problem.  The city's
snow plows don't operate on the park roads -- and the entrance
is blocked off with SAWHORSES reading ""CLOSED TO TRAFFIC.""  A
huge steep drift prevents them from entering -- and so all
they can do is stand by helplessly, WATCHING as the
snowmobiles vanish into the trees.

The COPS race about like headless chickens, trying to concoct
a plan.  A couple of them are trying to scale the stone walls
of the park.  Another is at his car, barking into a radio
mike:

COP WITH MIKE
Yeah, you heard me.  Snowmobiles!
(pause)
So what do we do?  Chase 'em on foot??

ALL EYES TURN at the blare of a horn.  The COPS peer down the
long corridor of the cross street -- and see a STRANGE BLACK
VEHICLE barreling toward them at 90 MPH, with no intention of
stopping...

THE BATMOBILE!!  COPS dive left and right.  A split-second
later...

...a FORTY-FOOT JET of NOVA-INTENSITY FLAME erupts from the
front of the jet-black supercar -- instantaneously DISSOLVING
the drift that blocks the entrance to the park -- turning the
ice and snow on the paths before it into water!

The BATMOBILE screams past in the wink of an eye.  The COPS
get to their feet; cold as it is, they're sweating.  One of
them mops his brow and announces, dumfounded:

COP I
...That was Batman.

COP II
NO SHIT!!

COP II yanks COP I into the nearest squad car, and the others
follow suit.  ENGINES REV.  As long as the BATMOBILE's cleared
a path, they might as well join in the chase...

EXT. BRIDLE PATH - THAT MOMENT

TWO BURLY TEENAGERS -- both dressed in RED BERETS and PARKAS
with BLACK BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS visible underneath -- are
trudging along the path when they're STARTLED by a pair of
speeding SKIDOOS.  Moments later, they spot a RED GLOW on the
horizon...

...and their JAWS DROP as the BATMOBILE roars into view,
BURNING OFF THE SNOW IN ITS PATH.  Thrilled beyond words, they
WHOOP WITH GLEE, slapping high-fives as the car streaks past.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

His face is weirdly illuminated by the flame still spitting
from the front of the car.  Cool as ever -- approaching the
chase as a simple problem in logic -- he checks a radar
display on his dashboard and sees FIVE BLIPS.

EXT. PARK - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The cops follow along in BATMAN's path.  The lead car LOSES
CONTROL and plows headlong into a drift.  The DRIVER jams the
pedal, but his rear wheels end up digging a deep rut in the
ice.  He sits there cursing, pumping the accelerator as other
COPS race past him on foot.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

The various ROBBERS have spread out, their vehicles BOUNDING
over the hilly terrain of the park.  He spots two of them up
ahead; as he draws closer, they PART WAYS, veering off to the
left and right...

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - MOVING

PODS OPEN on the front fenders, and MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into place.  The Batmobile fires a pair of HEAT-SEEKING
TORPEDOS, which BURROW into the snow on either side and
disappear.

ANGLE ON LEFT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

The DRIVER looks back over his shoulder and sees what appears
to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
hill...

...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION.

ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING

This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
explodes harmlessly.

The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
ITSELF into a distant TREE.

The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
heels into a drift.

In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance.

EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

We're at a makeshift CAMPSITE -- where a cluster of HOMELESS
PEOPLE are burning refuse in a garbage can to keep warm.  They
look on in puzzlement as the two SNOWMOBILES whiz past and
disappear over a crest of a hill...

EXT. LAKEFRONT - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

They bounce down the hillside and SKID -- arriving at the edge
of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
of the lake.

Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --

-- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
sliding forward.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

He shifts frantically from drive to reverse, trying to rock
the car out of its predicament, but his rear wheels find no
purchase.  He can hear the ice cracking beneath him.
Grimacing, he throws a switch on the dashboard --

EXT. LAKE - ON BATMOBILE

-- and the trunk pops open.  An industrial-strength GRAPPLING
HOOK shoots upward and digs in at a point beyond the crest of
the hill; and a concealed WINCH ASSEMBLY begins to grind away,
hauling the Batmobile uphill, out of danger.

INT. BATMOBILE - ON BATMAN

Suspended just above the icy lake, he sees the SNOWMOBILE
vanishing into the distance.  He opens (yet another) panel on
the dashboard...

EXT. LAKE - ON SNOWMOBILES #3 AND #4

The ROBBERS give each other a big thumbs-up.  They're almost
halfway across the lake now and the Batmobile is disabled.
All at once they hear a strange WHISTLING overhead...

Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water
-- and the ROBBERS are skidding into the drink before they
know what's hit them.

ANGLE ON SNOWMOBILE #5 - MOVING

The last of the robbers is SANTA CLAUS -- his big sack filled
not with toys, but precious stones.  He approaches the edge of
the park, negotiating his way through a maze of rocky
outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
clearing...

...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
to build up speed.

As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
the Batmobile rises half a foot --

-- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
tracks.

Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
almost atop him --

-- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
frame.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO PARK - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

The COPS are spread out near the entrance.  They've rounded up
the other ROBBERS and returned most of the loot.  They hear a
dull ROAR in the distance...

...and a few seconds later the BATMOBILE streaks into view,
dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.

At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his
colleague and SHRUGS:

COP I
...Merry Christmas.

The second COP points to SANTA, still struggling in the net.

COP II
Gift-wrapped and everything.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

TV MINICAM CREWS are camped out on the steps of City Hall,
with a sizable crowd watching from the street.  COMMISSIONER
GORDON is reading from a prepared statement.

GORDON
After a high-speed chase -- over $750,000
in precious jewels were recovered intact
by the police force -- working in concert
with Batman.

At the sound of Batman's name, a CHANTING goes up in the
crowd:

VOICES IN CROWD
TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE
STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE --

GORDON winces and lets out a sigh.  The CHANTERS are a group
of pugnacious, well-muscled KIDS, late teens and early
twenties, all dressed in identical garb: black Batman
SWEATSHIRTS and little red Guardian-angel BERETS.  They're
obviously members of the same club -- just like the guys we
saw in the park.

GORDON waits for them to shut up, but they don't; so he grabs
the mike and speaks slowly and distinctly, trying to be heard
over the din.

GORDON
I would like to stress -- that while this
city enjoys a special relationship with
Batman --
(louder)
-- we do not condone vigilantism --
(practically screaming)
-- IN ANY FORM.

It's no use.  He's totally drowned out by the RED BERETS, who
continue to shout and shake their fists.  Giving up, he
returns the mike to a REPORTER and marches up the steps in a
huff.  The RED BERETS CHEER.

CUT TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

The evening news: a live, on-the-spot interview from Gotham
Square.  A superimposed GRAPHIC identifies a surly kid in a
RED BERET as ""MIKE SEKOWSKY -- SPOKESPERSON -- ORDER OF THE
BAT.""

SEKOWSKY
And hey!  Where does this --
(BLEEP; expletive deleted)
-- Gordon get off calling us ?
We're not breakin' any laws.  We're a
group of concerned citizens, that's all --
just like Batman.

WOMAN IN CROWD
You people are nothing but hoodlums!

SEKOWSKY
Hey, lady -- we're out here on patrol
riskin' our necks to protect old biddies
like you.
(into mike)
If this lame-o Gordon could do his job --

MORE CATCALLS from the crowd.  The picture jumps suddenly as a
minicam is jostled; some sort of SCUFFLE appears to be
breaking out.  Before it does, CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV
screen, placing us in:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

where ALFRED THE BUTLER is watching the Sekowsky interview
with extreme dismay.  As he trims the crusts from a pair of
hearty watercress sandwiches, he SLICES HIS FINGER OPEN.

ALFRED makes a pained face -- it's all Sekowsky's fault.
Onscreen, the fracas continues; SEKOWSKY has recommandeered
the mike...

SEKOWSKY (on TV)
We're provin' that the spirit of Batman is
alive in this city.  We're gonna take back
the streets!

SEKOWSKY raises a fist.  Behind him, his CRONIES begin to
chant: ""TAKE BACK THE STREETS!  TAKE BACK THE STREETS!""
Incensed, sucking on his finger, ALFRED moves to the TV and
flicks it off.

He turns on the radio in search of something more soothing.
""Good King Wenceslas"" pipes through the manor; smiling, ALFRED
sets the sandwich plate alongside a steaming kettle on a
Sterling silver tea service.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The CAROL CONTINUES UNDERNEATH as ALFRED, white linen draped
over one forearm, sets the tea tray down on his master's big
mahogany desk.  He digs in his pocket for a key and unlocks a
side drawer.

The drawer contains a stack of yellowed, aging NEWPAPER
CLIPPINGS -- among them one which reads ""THOMAS WAYNE
MURDERED: Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery.
Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed.""  ALFRED digs
around beneath the clippings and finds a concealed SWITCH at
the rear of the drawer.

Gears grind, and a sectional bookcase detaches itself from the
wall -- sliding out a couple of feet to reveal a STONE
STAIRWAY which descends into darkness...

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

Descending the stone stairs, ALFRED arrives in the Batcave.
""Good King Wenceslas"" is on the speakers down here as well.
Across a catwalk the BATMOBILE rests on its little plateau,
wrapped in a tarp.

ALFRED clears some space on a lab table and sets the tea
service down.  He glances up at the bank of video monitors and
sees SEKOWSKY, still babbling, on several channels
simultaneously.  He scans the cave, but there's no trace of
BRUCE.

ALFRED
Sir?  -- MASTER BRUCE??

As if in response, BATS screech and flutter in the distant
recesses of the cavern.  ALFRED turns suddenly and sees BRUCE
behind him, suspended from a thin filament wire, RISING OUT OF
A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS.

BRUCE
I'm not deaf, Alfred.  I hear you.

He's wearing his civvie -- tweed pants and cashmere sweater --
but he's got the utility belt, with its spring-action reel,
buckled about his waist.  Clutching a bundle, he hangs in
midair for a moment, dangling over the void.  ALFRED slowly
regains his composure:

ALFRED
I took the liberty of preparing tea.
(indicating tbe monitors)
I take it you've been watching the news?

BRUCE, still dangling, glances up at the SEKOWSKY interview
and nods.

BRUCE
Yeah...lot of crazy people in this world.

BRUCE rocks back and forth to build up momentum.  He kicks off
on the nearest stone outcropping, lands gracefully on the
Batcave floor, and unbuckles his belt.  Preoccupied, he drops
his mysterious bundle on the lab table: a roll of black
fabric, and a cluster of lightweight, hollow ALUMINUM RODS,
connected by what appears to be SURGICAL TUBING.

ALFRED
I should inform you...Christmas is
approaching, and we've received our annual
solicitation from the Fireman's Toy Fund.
(eyeing the equipment)
If I may inquire...?

BRUCE
Oh, yeah.  Watch this.

BRUCE hits a trigger on a tiny gas canister attached to the
tubing.  The tubing inflates and the rods spring erect --
stiffening, wing-like, into something which looks remarkably
like the skeleton of an umbrella.

ALFRED
Most ingenious, sir.  What exactly  it?

BRUCE
What does it look like?

ALFRED
To the untrained eye, sir, it looks
remarkably like...the skeleton of an
umbrella.

Sounds good.  BRUCE eyes his new invention, thinks it over,
smiles slyly.

BRUCE
Good guess, Alfred.  That's exactly right.

BRUCE hits the trigger, and the rods WILT with a hiss.  He
sits at his lab table; ALFRED unfolds a napkin on his lap,
pours a cup of tea.

ALFRED
Splendid, sir, and if I may say, I'm glad
you're putting your time to such
productive use.
(beat)
Now -- the Toy Fund.  Our contribution
last year was a half-million dollars...

BRUCE
We can do better than that.

ALFRED
Then there's the foster-parents program...
the Gotham homeless crusade...

BRUCE nods abstractedly and tucks into his sandwich.  He seems
oddly preoccupied -- not exactly melancholy, but his thoughts
are obviously a million miles away.  ALFRED looks on,
concerned:

ALFRED (cont.)
Is something troubling you, sir?

BRUCE
Yeah...the holidays, I guess.  Always gets
me thinking about...
(he changes the subject)
And to tell you the truth, I'm a little --
concerned about Vicki.

ALFRED
(anxiously)
Miss Vale, sir...?

BRUCE
Yeah.  I've been thinking about it lately.
Thinking about it a lot...
(gravely; shaking his head)
...and I still can't figure out what to
get her for Christmas.

BRUCE shoots ALFRED a solemn, perplexed look -- and ALFRED
heaves an audible sigh of relief as we

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

TIGHT ON a stack of COOPS and CAGES, piled high against a bare
concrete wall.  Each cage -- and there are at least two dozen
of them -- contains a twittering BIRD: starlings, pigeons,
cardinals, titwillows...

CAMERA PULLS BACK from the bars of the cages to reveal a VERY
ODD FIGURE in prison greys.  A CANARY, perched on his
shoulder, SINGS HAPPILY as he stands in front of a grimy,
cracked mirror, plastering back his hair, BUFFING HIS NAILS
with quick, birdlike strokes.

MR. BONIFACE is beak-nosed, epicene, and so fat that it seems
his skin should burst; the adjective that comes to mind is
""obscene.""  Despite his eccentric appearance, he comports
himself with overblown, theatrical dignity.  Fastidious and
preening, he does not suffer insults lightly.

CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER -- through another set of bars --
and we realize that MR. BONIFACE is himself caged.  A PRISON
GUARD arrives to slide back his cell door...

GUARD
Up and at 'em, Pengy.  -- Pengy?

MR. BONIFACE pointedly ignores the GUARD, refusing to
acknowledge the odious (if wholly appropriate) nickname.

GUARD (cont.)
Boniface...

MR. BONIFACE finally turns.  With an expression of extreme
distaste, he affixes a MONOCLE over one eye, returns the
canary to its cage and allows himself to be ushered out.

INT. WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

MR. BONIFACE and his ATTORNEY sit at a long table across from
the WARDEN and the members of the PAROLE BOARD.

PAROLE OFFICER
You want to return the money you stole.

BONIFACE
Intact.  The map will show you where it's
buried.

The PAROLE OFFICER stares skeptically at a hand-scrawled MAP.

PAROLE OFFICER
All of it.  Forty-two million dollars.

MR. BONIFACE stares down humbly at the table -- as if he finds
the mere mention of his transgression too embarrassing to
bear.

PAROLE OFFICER II
Why this sudden change of heart?

MR. BONIFACE
Gentlemen, I want my debt to be repaid in
full.  I want to be a part of civilized
society!
(oozing sincerity)
Prison life is not for me.  The guilt, the
fear, the constant shame...one meets a
disturbingly low class of people.

PAROLE OFFICER II
Sure, but -- forty-two million dollars??

MR. BONIFACE nods plaintively.  It's quite a perfomlance.  He
dabs at his face with a handkerchief; it's hot in here, and
he's the delicate type...

WARDEN
His record's clean.  Thirteen years
without an incident.

ATTORNEY
I'd like to point out, my client's put his
time to good use.  A student of
ornithology...articles published in
several respected journals...

The PAROLE OFFICER thumbs through a stack of magazines: Bird
World, Ornithological Review, Beaks And Feathers, Nest Egg.

MR. BONIFACE
Birds, yes.  My only source of solace.

PAROLE OFFICER
In light of this rather extraordinary
gesture, I see no reason not to endorse
your application for parole.

BONIFACE
Thank you, sir.  You won't regret it.

MR. BONIFACE shakes hands with the members of the PAROLE
BOARD.  As the GUARDS escort him out, a BLACK MYNAH BIRD
SQUAWKS LOUDLY from its cage in the corner of the office:

MYNAH
CRIME DOES NOT PAY.  AAWWK!!  CRIME DOES
NOT PAY.

CHUCKLES all around.  On his way out the ATTORNEY gestures
toward the mynah -- and BEAMS at the parole board:

ATTORNEY
Personally trained by my client.

INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

Free time -- the cell doors are open and the convicts are
milling around in the common area.  T-BONE, 220 lbs. of dumb,
hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate,
MR. BONIFACE, staring at a stack of EMPTY CAGES.  BONIFACE
whirls on him suddenly, his face beet-red, APOPLECTIC WITH
RAGE:

MR. BONIFACE
-- Where are my birds?!?

T-BONE
Shit, Pengy.  I let 'em go.

MR. BONIFACE
Hermione.  My canary.  It's the dead of
winter!

T-BONE flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying MR.
BONIFACE's profound distress.

T-BONE
They were all cooped up.  With you leaving
and all -- seemed like the humane thing to
do.

BONIFACE'S GAZE FALLS on a corner of the cell.  He spots a
scattering of YELLOW FEATHERS -- a patch of FRESH BLOOD.  With
a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...

MR. BONIFACE
I see.  -- You might as well have this.  I
won't be needing it...

He tosses a SONY WALKMAN to T-BONE, who flicks it on.  The dim
strains of CLASSICAL MUSIC are audible through the
earphones...

T-BONE
Well, thanks, Pengy.  No hard feelings.
(chuckling to himself)
Y'know, I'm gonna miss that pudgy little
ass of yours.

T-BONE tunes the Walkman to a rock station, slips the headset
on, grins from his bunk.  TWO GUARDS arrive.  As they escort
him out, MR. BONIFACE mutters:

MR. BONIFACE
You won't miss it long.

EXT. PRISON - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

It's fifteen degrees outside as MR. BONIFACE -- aka THE
PENGUIN -- waddles forth from the prison gates, regally
attired in cutaway and pin-stripes.  He pauses to inhale a
deep lungful of the icy air; then, with a smile of
exhilaration, he removes his coat and STRETCHES -- spreading
his wings, REVELING in the cold.

A STRETCH LIMO pulls up.  Two identically gaunt and vulture-
like DANDIES, formally dressed, with bowler hats and
umbrellas, step out to meet him.  These two gentlemen -- FRICK
and FRACK -- serve as the Penguin's general factoti and
""business managers.""

FRICK
Welcome back, Mr. Boniface.

PENGUIN
Mr. Frick.  Mr. Frack.  Our years of
planning are about to pay off.

INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY

Now that he's loose, the PENGUIN's rapacious side is beginning
to show.  His eyes twinkle with greed as he contemplates his
own ingenuity.

PENGUIN
I take it they found the money all right?

FRACK
We buried it exactly as you specified.
$42,271,009...

PENGUIN
How much have we got left?

FRICK reaches into his coat for a BALANCE SHEET.

FRICK
Let's see -- an initial capitalization of
42 million and change, compounded over
thirteen years, at an annual return of
just under sixteen percent --

PENGUIN
Fine, fine.  How much?

FRICK
Seventy-nine million.  -- Excluding the
sum we buried.

THE PENGUIN lets out a dry, heaving CHORTLE, midway between a
normal laugh and a DUCK'S QUACK.  He checks his watch and
reaches into his pocket for a small ELECTRONIC DEVICE.

PENGUIN
Speaking of burials...

EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

T-BONE on work detail.  He's got the Walkman on and he's
shoveling snow to the beat.  He winces, and removes the
headphones...

The MUSIC he was listening to has been replaced by an eerie,
high-pitched WHINE.  He's twisting the knob, trying to find
the station he was tuned to, when a PIGEON dives down STRAIGHT
AT HIS HEAD.

T-BONE
HEY -- !

He drops the shovel as the bird STRIKES, glancing off his
head.  Before he can react, THREE MORE PIGEONS have swooped
down at him, PECKING at his head and shoulders in a frenzy.

He lets out a HOWL and staggers through the prison yard in a
frenzy.  DOZENS of PIGEONS are pouring over the prison walls,
SHRIEKING HIDEOUSLY, descending on him.  He falls to the
ground screaming for help, but the other prisoners run like
rabbits, terrified...

By the time the GUARDS come racing across the courtyard,
T-BONE's no longer even visible.  There's just a swarming,
man-shaped mass of PIGEONS, pecking away, flapping their wings
insanely.  Covering their faces as they move in, the GUARDS
blow their whistles -- BEAT AT the pigeons with billy clubs.

All at once, the PIGEONS take off en masse -- leaving T-BONE's
mutilated corpse sprawled in the yard.  A GUARD notices the
Walkman, picks up the earphones to listen, and hears nothing
but ROCK MUSIC -- ""Surfin' Bird"" by the Trashmen.  Bird bird
bird, bird is the word...

EXT. ROAD - ON PENGUIN'S LIMO - MOVING

An AERIAL VIEW of the LIMO as it cruises down the deserted
road leading away from the prison.  It disappears from view --
and all at once the frame is filled with PIGEONS, great
squalling FLOCKS of them, dutifully following their master as
he makes his way back to Gotham City.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

ALFRED opens the front door and finds a bundled-up VICKI out
on the portico, red-cheeked, flushed, and happy.  She pulls
him forward, gives him a quick peck on the cheek.

VICKI
Guess what, Alfred.  I think I found a
present for Bruce.

She's got a long, skinny GIFT BOX propped up against the
exterior wall.  At first it doesn't want to fit through the
door -- it must be eight feet long -- but with ALFRED's help
she gets it inside.  The faithful butler stares curiously at
this odd-shaped gift...

VICKI (cont.)
Skis.  -- Don't let on, okay?

ALFRED
He won't hear a word of it from me.

VICKI
He's such a nightmare to shop for.  --
What do you get him year after year,
Alfred?

ALFRED
(conspiratorially)
I find you can't go wrong with
surveillance equipment.  Let me put this
under the tree...

VICKI
Not so fast.

She reaches into the pocket of her coat and pulls out another
small gift.  ALFRED stares at the tag -- ""TO ALFRED, LOVE
VICKI"" -- and tries to suppress a HUGE GRIN.

ALFRED
Why, Miss Vale -- !

VOICE FROM BEHIND
What's all this?

ALFRED and VICKI turn.  It's BRUCE, dressed for dinner,
marching down the long stairway in the entry hall.  VICKI
waves frantically.

VICKI
Don't look.  It's your present.

VICKI rushes over to embrace him.  He gapes at the long skinny
box --

BRUCE
What'd you get me?  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?

VICKI frowns and gives him a kiss.  She nestles up against
him.  WHISPERS in his ear:

VICKI
I'm going to give you the happiest
Christmas you've ever had.

Still in the clinch, BRUCE shoots a look at ALFRED.  Taking
the hint, ALFRED clears his throat and bends to pick up one
end of the ski box.  He backs out of the entry hall, dragging
the box before him...

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM PARK - NIGHT

FIRES burn in garbage cans.  TENTS and LEAN-TOS dot the snowy
landscape.  Men, women, and children wander aimlessly,
huddling against the cold.

An army of the HOMELESS has set up camp in Gotham Park.  On
the nearby periphery, PICKETERS -- half concerned citizens,
half down-and-outers -- are marching the sidewalks, keeping a
candlelight VIGIL.  Hand-lettered placards read: ""SAVE THE
PARK.""  ""PARKS ARE FOR PEOPLE.""  ""THIS PARK IS OUR HOME.""

The source of the protest?  A towering SIGN posted in a corner
of the park, announcing the imminent consuuction of a new
luxury highrise -- the GOTHAM PARK TOWERS -- a project of Shaw
Construction, Inc.

A LAMBORGHINI sits at a traffic light nearby...

INT. LAMBORGHINI - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BRUCE and VICKI, dressed for dinner, stare out at the
demonstration.

VICKI
Homeless.
(beat)
I was just down here Tuesday.  Seems like
there's more every day.

BRUCE starts to say something, but can't think of anything to
say.

VICKI (cont.)
Christmas time.  And they say there's over
a thousand people living in the park
already.

BRUCE
-- Yeah.

The light changes.  BRUCE throws the car into gear and -- at
the next intersection -- turns the car right, into the park.

EXT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

Despite the name, it's a tony little bistro catering to
Gotham's elite.  A PANHANDLER, underdressed for the cold, has
been hustling the customers as they come out; a couple of
PARKING ATTENDANTS are trying to drag him discreetly away as
BRUCE'S CAR pulls up.

A VALET opens the car for BRUCE and VICKI, who look on in
concern as the PANHANDLER gets the bum's rush.  The liveried
DOORMAN shrugs apolagetically -- sorry for the inconvenience
-- as they enter.

INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

Post-dinner.  VICKI's got a sheaf of PHOTOS spread out on the
table in front of BRUCE -- shots of Gotham's HOMELESS, being
forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their
SHANTYTOWNS in Gotham Park.

VICKI
They're already razing the tenements and
SRO's downtown.  These people don't have
anyplace else to go.
(beat)
If the city starts selling off the park...

BRUCE takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings.
HUGE WINDOWS open on a serene and picturesque view of the
park; CAMPFIRES flicker in the distance...

BRUCE
-- Yeah.  I guess I'll pass on dessert.

VICKI
(taking his hand)
Bruce, you do a lot more than most people
even dream of.

BRUCE
Sure.  Comes off the top of my taxes --

VICKI
That's not what I meant.

They exchange a long silent look.  Of course she's referring
to Batman.  Still, the argument doesn't hold much water with
BRUCE.

BRUCE
-- What I ""do"" doesn't come close to the
root of the problem, Vicki.
(long pause)
I'm just a Band-Aid.

VOICE FROM BEHIND
Bruce!  It's been ages!

VICKI turns -- and rapidly closes her photo folder.
Millionaire construction magnate RANDALL SHAW is in the
restaurant table-hopping, and he's just glommed onto BRUCE.

BRUCE
Randall.  You remember Vicki.  -- How's
the construction business?

SHAW
The park tower?  All systems go.  If we
can get the junkies and winos cleared
out...
(a big grin)
Not too late to get in on the deal.

BRUCE
I'll think about it.

SHAW
Say, Walter Barrett's due back from
Europe.  We should all get together at the
club.
(clapping him on the shoulder)
Nice to see you again,  Miss Veal.

""Miss Veal"" maintains a big phony smile as SHAW moves off to
the next table.  She murmurs to BRUCE through clenched teeth:

VICKI
What a pig.

BRUCE
I've known him since he was seven years
old.  He was a pig then too.

VICKI
Now he wants to gobble up the park...
(shivering)
Bruce -- isn't there something you can do
about people like that?

BRUCE
What, tie him up with a bat-rope?

VICKI
No, you idiot.  I meant you.  Bruce.

BRUCE nods -- oh, yeah.  Subtle distinction.

INT. PUB-IN-THE-PARK - NIGHT

BRUCE and VICKI emerge from the restaurant.  He hands his
parking stub to a VALET.  A crowd's beginning to form in the
lot outside...

The red-and-blue bubble of a POLICE CAR is flashing a short
distance off, near the entrance to the park.  TWO RED BERETS,
in full Order-of-the-Bat regalia, look on as a recently-mugged
WOMAN JOGGER gives her statement to the investigating COPS.

BRUCE and VICKI, intrigued by the Batman-wannabes, move a
little closer -- within eavesdropping range:

RED BERET I
We were on patrol.  Saw the whole thing.

JOGGER
I was attacked.  Three men in ski masks --

COP I
(indicating the RED BERETS)
And these two broke it up?

JOGGER
These two??  They ran like rabbits.  I
never saw anybody take off so --

RED BERET II
Hey!  Somebody had to go for the cops.

COP II
You.  SHUT UP, all right??
(to the JOGGER)
Lady, who was it that bailed you out??

JOGGER
A kid.  Thirteen or fourteen tops.  He
just came out of nowhere and -- tore into
'em.
(shaking her head)
It was so quick I didn't even see his
face.

Nearby, VICKI shoots a highly quizzical look at BRUCE, who
responds with a mystified shrug.  Her professional curiosity
piqued, she wanders over to introduce herself to the JOGGER.

An exasperated COP leads the RED BERETS away from the crime
site:

RED BERET I
Dumb shit.  Shouldn'ta been jogging in the
park at night anyway.
(sullenly)
Look around you.  It's fulla bums.

BRUCE gestures at the RED BERET's Batman sweatshirt as he
passes.

BRUCE
Nice outfit.

RED BERET I
Piss off, geek.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT DISTRICT - NIGHT

Snow blankets the abandoned warehouses rimming Gotham Harbor.
FOGHORNS blare in the distance as a pair of STILETTO HEELS --
totally inappropriate for the weather -- click across the
sidewalk and pause at mid-block, where a wide wooden plank
leads down from street level to a seedy hole-in-the-wall bar:
the WHARF RAT.

INT. WHARF RAT - NIGHT

A roughneck joint, about as trendy as the average bait shack.
The clientele consists primarily of surly types who are saving
up for their next tattoo.  A TV over the bar is tuned to the
late news:

ANCHORWOMAN
...and tomorrow, the city's power elite
will be turning out in force to greet
millionaire industrialist Walter Barrett,
who returns to Gotham after a five-year
stay in Europe...

The BARTENDER switches to a hockey game, because none of the
rowdies at the bar give a shit about Walter Barrett.  None,
that is, except for a strapping young bruiser named RICKY, who
gets up and makes his way to a pay phone in the corner.

Moments later, the owner of the high heels enters; she opens
her black fur coat and unwraps her muffler, revealing exotic,
vaguely Eurasian features.  She's dark and elegant, fine-
boned, regal of bearing -- and her name, though we don't know
it yet, is SELINA KYLE.

She's not the kind of girl who typically frequents the Wharf
Rat, and so her entrance creates quite a stir.  A LONGSHOREMAN
at the nearby pool table misses his shot and digs a rut in the
felt.  Two blowsy WHORES size her up territorially as she
finds an open stool at the bar and settles in with serene
indifference.

The regulars, of course, are all but licking their chops.  The
only guy in the joint who hasn't noticed her yet is RICKY,
who's still on the phone:

RICKY
Yo.  Ricky here.  What's the haps?

In mid-conversation he notices SELINA.  She smiles invitingly
-- right at him.  Mildly startled, he smiles back.

RICKY (cont.)
Midnight.  No sweat.  See you then.

He hangs up eagerly.  Then, with a deep breath, he hitches up
his pants and swaggers over to SELINA's end of the bar.

SELINA
Well.  ""Ricky,"" is it?

RICKY
How'd you know that?

SELINA
I heard you on the phone.  Talking to your
girlfriend.

RICKY
Girlfriend?  No, no.  That was business.

SELINA makes a big show of peeling off her gloves.

SELINA
If you've got time for a little pleasure
...maybe you'd like to buy me a drink.

She clasps his hand.  His EYES BUG OUT.  Three enormous rings,
a diamond bracelet -- there must be several thousand in rocks
on her left hand alone.  RICKY gapes at the sparklers,
bedazzled.

RICKY
Jeez -- they look almost real.

SELINA
Why wouldn't they be?

RICKY is not the smoothest guy around, and his line of thought
is all too evident.  He swallows hard and tries not to stare.

RICKY
You'd have to be crazy.  Nobody'd wear the
real thing to a dive like this.

SELINA
Oh, they're real, all right.  So are
these.

She waves her FINGERNAILS -- long, polished, and talon-sharp
-- in front of his eyes.  With lightning speed, before he can
react, she pins his wrist to the bar -- and with one quick
stroke carves a THIN BLOODY STRIPE in the back of his hand.

SELINA's eyes flash as he gasps in shock.  He tries to jerk
his hand away, but he can't break her grip.  Then -- her
dominance firmly established -- she releases his hand with a
coy, Cheshire-cat smile.

SELINA (cont.)
Weren't we going to have a drink?

He blinks, forces a chuckle, smiles unsteadily.  She takes his
wounded hand, lifts it slowly to her mouth, and LAPS GENTLY at
the blood.  RICKY is hypnotized.

She's got an odd way of flirting, but RICKY finds it somehow
-- intriguing.  He dabs at his hand with a napkin and signals
to the BARTENDER.

CUT TO:

EXT. WATERFRONT - PIER 31 - NIGHT

Just after midnight; the snow's still failing, the waters are
icy, and the wharfs are deserted -- almost.  A small STEAMBOAT
is docked at Pier 31, and the deck is lined with THUGS --
mean, ugly, and heavily armed.

A similar contingent of gun-toting GOONS is waiting to greet
them on the dock below.  The boys on the dock hoist ASSAULT
RIFLES as the BOAT THUGS extend a gangplank.  Something major
is about to happen...

The CHIEF DOCK GOON gestures to his LIEUTENANT, who grabs a
black MEDICAL BAG.  Hands raised, the two of them start up the
gangplank.

Throughout all this, the DOCK GOONS keep their guns trained on
the BOAT THUGS, covering their buddies.  One of them turns to
a colleague:

DOCK GOON I
Where's that goddam Ricky?

DOCK GOON II
Probably out gettin' laid.  And here we
are freezin' our balls off...

EXT. STEAMBOAT - ON DECK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The LIEUTENANT unloads chemical testing gear from his doctor's
bag.  The lead BOAT THUG gestures to a stack of SHIPPING
CRATES which rest atop a large NET spread out across the deck.

BOAT THUG I
You pick.

The CHIEF GOON selects a crate at random.  Two BOAT THUGS tip
it on its side and, using a crowbar, pry off a FALSE BOTTOM --
revealing a dozen packets of WHITE POWDER.

POV SHOT - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

We're now watching the scene from a vantage point atop a
ramshackle boathouse at water's edge.  Down on the deck of the
steamboat, the LIEUTENANT goes to work testing the
merchandise.

LIEUTENANT
It's pure.

REVERSE ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

A BLACK SILHOUETTE is peering down from the boathouse roof.
The mysterious watcher ducks quickly out of sight; the only
details that register are a pair of ominously familiar POINTY
EARS...

CHIEF GOON (O.S.)
Let's do it.

He gestures to his boys on the dock. A CRANE-AND-WINCH
assembly rotates into place over the deck -- and the BOAT
THUGS gather up the corners of the netting and attach them to
the big hook.

BOAT THUG I
Hold it.  Let's see the money.

Down on the wharf, a DOCK GOON kneels beside a metal suitcase
and opens it.  Lots of long green inside.  The BOAT THUG
signals thumbs up, and the CRATES rise into the air as the
goon with the suitcase starts up the gangplank.

LOW ANGLE - ON GANGPLANK - THAT MOMENT

The goon with the suitcase marches up.  Beyond him, in the
distance, a LITHE BLACK SHADOW vaults off the boathouse roof
and makes a silent, graceful landing on the long shaft of the
CRANE.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

The moment of maximum tension: grim faces all around, everyone
holding a gun on someone else as the suitcase arrives on deck
and crane swings over the pier.

ANGLE ON CRANE - THAT MOMENT

Razor-sharp, CHROME-STEEL TALONS slash suddenly through the
air.

ON DOCK - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

The netting GIVES WAY, and TWO DOZEN SHIPPING CRATES rain down
onto the pier, CRUSHING two DOCK GOONS underneath.  The crates
explode into splinters, littering the dock with drugs and
random ART OBJECTS as the other DOCK GOONS scatter in panic.

ON STEAMBOAT - THAT MOMENT

Nobody knows quite what's going on.  Panicking, the GOON with
the suitcase full of money turns tail and dives for the
gangplank.  BOAT THUG I sees him and squeezes off a quick
shot.  Winged, the GOON topples off the gangplank and hits the
drink, suitcase and all.

Pandemonium.  All at once, everyone's OPENING FIRE.  Thinking
he's been double-crossed, BOAT THUG I turns on the CHIEF GOON
and SHOOTS HIM TWICE at point-blank range.

BOAT THUG I
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
(to another BOAT THUG)
Go after it.  Get the money.  GO!!

He raises his gun, and the second BOAT THUG dutifully obeys --
diving off the deck into a hail of gunfire.  Everyone's
ducking for cover.  BOAT THUG I barks orders at the
pilothouse:

BOAT THUG I
Soltar las amarras!  -- CAST OFF!!

ANOTHER BOAT THUG
LOOK!

BOAT THUG I whirls, just in time to see a SHADOWY FIGURE
landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky
black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with
openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.

She bares her teeth and HISSES.

It's a woman.

BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes
him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She
SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps
to the deck, lifeless.

The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
toppling into the water.

The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
pier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.

Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
specimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one
goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
reeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up
action takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she
stands back to survey the scene.

Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow
is speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
and softly MOANING.

Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE
POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all
about the pier, but she couldn't seem less interested.
Instead, she's checking the MANIFEST NUMBERS stamped on the
sides of the crates.

She finds crate #18396-BB and rummages among its contents
until she comes up with a carefully-wrapped parcel.  She opens
it carefully and holds it up for inspection.  The statuette of
a RAVEN -- carved from solid onyx -- glistens in the
moonlight.

The WOMAN pauses long enough to slip a small CARD in the
MOANING PUNK's back pocket.  Then, cradling the raven under
one arm, she dashes off on silent cat feet.

A LANTERN approaches.  It's an OLD SALT -- some kind of
hapless night watchman -- and his face goes bone-white at the
sight of the carnage on the docks.  He kneels beside the
moaning punk, turns the body over, and GASPS -- because the
PUNK'S FACE has been CLAWED TO SHREDS.

PUNK
Murcielago.  MURCIELAGO!!

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - NIGHT

The unique chamber in which we find ourselves is alive with
the flutter and song of COLD-WEATHER BIRDS -- dozens of them,
all chirping, flitting about in the rafters, alighting on
special perches mounted in the walls.

At the center of this penthouse room is a vast sunken POOL.
ARCTIC TERNS loll on the surrounding rocks as a LACKEY with a
wheelbarrow empties cracked ice into the already-frigid water.
Carefully landscaped, it looks like the penguin exhibit at the
Gotham Zoological Gardens.

A MASSIVE, INDISTINCT SHAPE glides beneath the surface.  It's
not a whale; it's too pink.  It is, instead, the PENGUIN --
and as he breaks the surface, sputtering, he sees FRICK
standing in the open doorway.

FRICK
Mr. Boniface?  Your...visitor has arrived.

PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Frick.  Show her in.

The PENGUIN moves to the edge of the sunken pool.  Two of his
LACKEYS swivel a CROSSBAR, which hangs from the ceiling by a
long chain, into place over his head.  He grasps it with both
hands -- and the crossbar RISES, hoisting his formidable bulk
out of the water.

INT. HIGH-RISE - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT

FRICK leads the VISITOR down a long corridor lined on either
side with BIRD CAGES -- exotic songbirds with brilliantly-hued
plumage.  CAMERA TRACKS ALONG behind her, and although we
can't see her face, there must be something distinctively
feline about her -- because the BIRDS are shrieking and
fluttering in their cages, RECOILING INSTINCTIVELY as she
strolls past.

FRICK opens a door and ushers her into...

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

Our visitor -- SELINA KYLE -- enters the penguin-pool room.
Her teeth begin to chatter.  The big bay windows have been
thrown open, and SNOW is blowing in from outside. It's
freezing in here.

She sees the PENGUIN -- wearing a thin dressing gown and an
APRON outfitted with SEED POUCHES -- scattering birdseed on
the window ledge for the pigeons, totally oblivious to the
cold.  He turns, throws his arms wide in greeting, kisses the
back of SELINA's hand.

PENGUIN
Ah, Miss Kyle!  At last we meet.

SELINA
At last we meet.  -- Pigeons?

PENGUIN
Yes, they're common birds -- dirty,
stupid, unattractive -- but they're very
obedient, and they do crap on people's
heads.  May I?

She extends a SHOPPING BAG.  The PENGUIN removes a parcel and
unwraps it, revealing the RAVEN STATUETTE.  He sets it on a
nearby desk, fondles it reverently...and BEAMS at SELINA.

PENGUIN (cont.)
I see your reputation was not exaggerated.

SELINA
I've located the others.  All but one.
(shivering)
I'm surprised you don't catch
pneumonia -- !

With an apologetic smile, the PENGUIN pulls the windows shut.

PENGUIN
My normal body temperature is ninety-two
degrees.  Germs find me inhospitable.

SELINA
I see why they call you the Penguin.

PENGUIN
They may call me that...but rarely more
than once.  Champagne?

She nods.  He pours two glasses, hands one to SELINA, raises a
toast.

PENGUIN (cont.)
My dear.  Here's to the second biggest
crime in the history of Gotham City.

CUT TO:

INT. POLICE OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

COMMISSIONER GORDON and another cop, LT. EDDIE BULLOCK, are in
darkened antechamber adjacent to an interrogation room.

BULLOCK
It wasn't about the drugs.  Whoever it was
left thirty kilos sitting on the docks.

They're watching, through a two-way glass panel, as a
terrified man with a heavily-bandaged face tells his story.
It's the lone survivor of the dock massacre, JULIO, and his
voice is audible over a concealed intercom:

JULIO (filter)
Un silueta negra -- con colmillos, y
garras -- el demonio.  El murcielago.
MURCIELAGO!

GORDON
What's that he keeps saying?

BULLOCK
""Murcielago.""  -- Bat.

GORDON
Nonsense.  That dock looked like a
slaughter-house.  Batman's never committed
murder.

BULLOCK
We did find this in his back pocket.

BULLOCK hands GORDON a CARD.  It reads: ""THOSE WHO FEED ON THE
SOUL OF GOTHAM WILL SUFFER MY WRATH"" -- and in lieu of a
signature, there's a little black BAT-EMBLEM in the bottom
corner.

While GORDON's staring at it, a POLICEMAN pokes his head in:

POLICEMAN
Commissioner?  We've got Barrett.

INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT

A cubicle down the hall.  The splenetic WALTER BARRETT,
millionaire industrialist, is fidgeting in his chair as GORDON
enters.

BARRETT
Fine welcome.  These storm troopers of
yours dragged me away from my coming-home
party!
(beat)
I'd like to know the meaning of this --

GORDON
I'd like to know how thirty kilos of pure
cocaine wound up concealed in your
personal effects.

BARRETT
Gordon -- I come from one of the oldest
and most influential familles in Gotham.
If you plan to accuse me of smuggling
drugs, be my guest.
(long, menacing pause)
I'll have your badge before you leave this
room.

GORDON weighs the threat.  He nods to the COPS in
attendance...

GORDON
Book the son of a bitch.

GORDON storms out.  BARRETT jumps out of his chair, but the
COPS restrain him.  Outraged, he bats their hands away...

BARRETT
I believe I'm still entitled to a phone
call.

CUT TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - DAY

VICKI with her camera, squeezing off snaps.  She's standing
behind a SAWHORSE, part of a crowd of onlookers at a downtown
DEMOLITION SITE.  SURVEYORS and HARDHATS bustle about in a
VACANT LOT, a full city block in size, fenced off and strewn
with rubble.  The only structure still standing is a lone,
decrepit TENEMENT BUILDING; a WRECKING BALL is poised above
it, ready to strike.

A SIGN at one corner of the lot announces a forty-story OFFICE
COMPLEX soon to be erected on this site by SHAW CONSTRUCTION,
INC.  Down below is RANDALL SHAW HIMSELF, in necktie and
hardhat, speaking into a WALKIE-TALKIE:

SHAW
Come on!  Let's move it!  We're an hour
behind as it is!!

A few moments later, a CLUSTER OF PEOPLE emerge from the
tenement building -- a mixed team of COPS and CONSTRUCTION
GOONS who are forcibly removing a DESTITUTE FAMILY from the
condenmed building.  VICKI watches angrily...

HER POV - TELEPHOTO LENS

A quick series of shots: the SQUATTERS wailing and struggling,
clinging to the doorways, unwilling to leave.  Their few
belongings are packed in a couple of CARDBOARD BOXES, which
the cops heave rudely out onto the street.  Finally, the
handcuffs and nightsticks come out...

ANGLE ON SHAW - THAT MOMENT - DAY

A SURVEYOR grabs SHAW by the arm and points out the woman
taking photos in the crowd.  SHAW recognizes her instantly.
His face turns into a mask of outrage -- as if he's been
personally betrayed.

SHAW
Jesus Christ, that's Bruce Wayne's bimbo!

He makes eye contact with her.  VICKI stares back defiantly.
He's about to stroll over and tell her off when a HARDHAT
signals to him:

HARDHAT
Phone call, Mr. Shaw.  Guy said it's
urgent.

SHAW
(to tbe SURVEYOR)
Hold the ball.  I wanna hear it crash.

He climbs into the cab of a nearby TRUCK, where he picks up a
CELLULAR PHONE.

INTERCUT - BARRETT AND SHAW

BARRETT's still in custody at the police station -- using his
one phone call to contact the construction magnate.

BARRETT
It's me, Randall -- Walter Barrett.  I
want you to call my attorney.  That was my
shipment they busted up last night.

SHAW
Jesus, Walter, I --
(suddenly puzzled)
Why are you calling me??

BARRETT
It's worse than that.  Somebody took my
raven.

SHAW stares at the phone in horrified disbelief.

ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT

SHE WATCHES as SHAW climbs out of the truck -- numb, in a
daze.  He signals to the WRECKING BALL OPERATOR; a WHISTLE
blows, and the great iron ball knocks a MAMMOTH HOLE in the
facade of the tenement.

SHAW doesn't even stick around to watch it.  He scurries off
to his car at the end of the block.  VICKI, highly intrigued,
gets it all on film...

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

VICKI's in a huddle with the Managing Editor, SCHULTZ, showing
him her PHOTOS -- SHAW orchestrating the eviction of the
SQUATTER FAMILY.

SCHULTZ
Great stuff, but we're looking at a
shitfight with our beloved publisher.  He
and Shaw...
(crossing his fingers)
Old money sticks together.

VICKI points to a photo of SHAW racing from the truck to his
car.

VICKI
I'd sure like to know what shook him up
so.  He was out of there like a scared
rabbit...

Just then, a reporter -- WILK -- rushes up excitedly to
SCHULTZ's desk.

WILK
Got a blind tip from downtown.  You know
that massacre on the docks?  Batman.

VICKI reacts in astonishment.  SCHULTZ's jaw drops -- this is
hot.

EDITOR
Whoa!  Is this on the level?

WILK
Cops even got a note.  ""Those who feed on
the soul of Gotham will suffer my wrath!""
(grinning; to VICKI)
Sounds like your pal's cranked it up a
notch.

VICKI starts to protest, but thinks better of it.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - EVENING

ALFRED opens the door.  A BANNER HEADLINE stares him in the
face:

BATMAN IMPLICATED IN DOCK MASSACRE
Industrialist Linked to Drug Smuggling Ring

VICKI, who's holding up the afternoon paper for ALFRED's
inspection, peeks out glumly from behind the masthead.

VICKI
Seen the late edition?

ALFRED
I'm afraid so, Miss Vale.  Master Bruce is
sequestered in the cave.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

On their way to the Batcave, ALFRED and VICKI pass through the
library.  They pause in front of the television -- which is
tuned to a PANEL SHOW, with various experts discussing the hot
issue of the day.

ENVIRONMENTALIST (on TV)
Walter Barrett's no saint.  His factories
have been dumping poison into the air and
water for years.  If he is mixed up with
drugs...

PUNDIT (on TV)
That's not the issue.  The issue is, do we
entrust our public safety to some...masked
vigilante.  Does Batman have a license to
kill?

ALFRED
(shaking his head)
Ah, the public.  Dishearteningly fickle.

VICKI follows ALFRED out.  We HOLD on the TV as the CAMERA
PANS OVER to the third guest on the panel, loudly demanding
air time.  He's wearing a RED BERET and a BATMAN SWEATSHIRT:

MIKE SEKOWSKY (on TV)
Yo, here's the tip, man.  Drug dealers are
scum.  If Batman did wax these punks...SO
WHAT?  They deserved it!  End of
discussion.

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING

ALFRED and VICKI arrive; BRUCE gestures for them to keep
quiet.  He's hunched over a TAPE RECORDER -- and COMMISSIONER
GORDON'S VOICE is blaring from a nearby speaker...

GORDON (O.S.; filter)
Anyone could've written that note.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

GORDON's in conference with a number of CITY OFFICIALS --
blissfully unaware that anyone might be eavesdropping.

CITY OFFICIAL I
And I suppose anyone could've taken out a
boatload of armed thugs.  A dozen men, Jim
-- murdered in cold blood --

GORDON
Before we forget, Batman's saved hundreds
of lives!

CITY OFFICIAL II
He's still a vigilante.  We don't know who
he is, where he comes from, why he does
it...

CITY OFFICIAL I
Street punks are one thing, Jim.  This is
Walter Barrett -- a personal friend of
mine!

As the conversation continues, CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN ON a
COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.  We see the tiny TRADEMARK
embossed on the CPU -- ""WAYNE TECHNOLOGIES.""

INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT - ON BRUCE

as he LISTENS through his concealed bug.

CITY OFFCIAL II
You've gotta bring him in, Jim -- at least
for questioning.  It would sure help if we
could get that mask off...

BRUCE shuts the recorder off.  He turns to face ALFRED and
VICKI --

BRUCE
Ladies and gentlemen...I've been framed.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

The BAT-SIGNAL blazing in the night sky.  After a beat, the
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a cluster of EXCITED CITIZENS, who point
and holler as the BATMOBILE streaks past.

INT. SQUAD CAR - THAT MOMENT

TWO COPS are parked in an alleyway, watching as the BATMOBILE
whizzes past on the street.  The DRIVER pulls out behind it as
the second COP grabs his radio mike...

COP
One-delta-niner -- 10-80 on Riverview
north-bound at 33rd -- 10-78, repeat
10-78.

VOICE ON RADIO (filter)
10-4, one-delta-niner -- that's a 10-37,
repeat 10-37.  Backup on the way.

EXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE

BARRELING TOWARD US on the street.  The SQUAD CAR gains behind
it.  A SIREN HOWLS; a red-and-blue bubble begins to flash...

The BATMOBILE makes a HAIRPIN TURN -- and ACCELERATES.

OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE STREETS

As the BATMOBILE rounds the corner and picks up speed, TWO
MORE SQUAD CARS scream down the cross street, joining in the
pursuit.  All at once THICK BLACK SMOKE billows from the back
of the Batmobile -- ENVELOPING the police cars, BLINDING THE
DRIVERS...

EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TWO SQUAD CARS parked in a V-formation -- a makeshift
roadblock.  ANXIOUS POLICEMEN mill about in front of them.
They move into position as the BATMOBILE, still trailing
smoke, rounds a corner and careens directly toward them...

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT

The FRONT FENDER of the Batmobile detaches and EXTENDS itself
from the body of the car.  It BENDS in the middle; WING-PANELS
flip into place, forming an arrowhead-shaped COW-CATCHER.

EXT. STREET - ON ROADBLOCK

A SHRIEKING HORN BLARES.  The COPS see the Batmobile SPEEDING
UP and dive for the sidewalk.  The COW-CATCHER slams into the
SOUAD CARS, pushes them effortlessly aside, and cruises
through the gap.

As the PURSUING CARS emerge from the smoke cloud and follow
the Batmobile through, we TILT UP to the roof of a nearby
building --

EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

-- and realize that the Batmobile's on automatic pilot,
because BATMAN's been on the roof all along -- watching the
action with some dismay.

His relationship with the Gotham PD appears to be on shaky
ground.  He speaks into his voice-activated REMOTE CONTROL
UNIT:

BATMAN
Evasive.

SIRENS HOWL below as he strolls across the rooftop, lost in
thought.

CUT TO:

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

At this height, the SIRENS are a distant insect drone.  We're
in the palatial digs of RANDALL SHAW, the construction
magnate.  There's obviously money to be made in real-estate
development -- because the walls are lined with art, and the
floor-to-ceiling windows open on the most spectacular view in
Gotham.

At the moment, SHAW's posing casually in front of his new
Brancusi -- which rests on a pedestal near the windows.  An
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN in a slinky black dress LOOKS ON, her back
to the camera...

WOMAN
It's a fake.

SHAW
Hmm.  It cost me a half a million dollars.
You're sure?

WOMAN
Absolutely.  You see, I...happen to know
where the real one is stashed.

The WOMAN wanders out of frame as SHAW smiles, impressed.  He
seems peculiarly nonchalant about the whole deal; at the
moment, art is not the first thing on his mind.  CAMERA STAYS
ON HIM as he pours two glasses of red wine and circles in on
his mysterious guest.

SHAW
I guess you'd know.  I have some ""friends""
in the art world.  They say that -- for
certain hard-to-get items -- you're the
one to call.

WOMAN (O.S.)
How flattering.

SHAW
They say for the right price...you could
steal Michelangelo off the Sistine Chapel
Wall.

WOMAN (O.S.)
Mr. Shaw.  Do you believe everything you
hear?

SHAW
Oh, I'm not one to judge.  I admire people
who take what they want.  I'm just curious
how you do it.

SHAW hands her the wine, and for the first time we see her
face.  It's SELINA KYLE, perching seductively on the arm of
the sofa...

SELINA
I find that the old methods work best.

Setting her wine down, flashing her patented Cheshire-cat
smile, SELINA moves in on him -- and they go into a deep,
passionate kiss.  Her long red nails dig into his back; SHAW
drops his wine glass, which SHATTERS -- splashing red wine
across the polished parquet floor.

INT. PENTHOUSE - SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The action's gone horizontal.  SELINA, peeled down to a sheer
lace teddy, is on the bed atop SHAW -- tickling his throat
with quick, lapping kisses.  She rolls off suddenly; when he
tries to sit up, she pushes him back down with a single
finger.

Sitting on the edge of the bed, she peels off her STOCKINGS,
twisting them around into tight cords.  With a coy smile she
runs her finger in a circle around SHAW's hairy chest -- and
then, abruptly, knots one stocking tightly about his wrist and
ties it off on the bedpost.

SHAW
Hey, what are you doing -- ?

He tries to break her grip.  She BACKHANDS him sharply across
the face.

SELINA
You're very inquisitive.  You'll just have
to be disciplined.

An EDGY SMILE spreads across his face as she binds his other
hand to the bedpost.  None too quick, he's just caught on that
all this is part of SELINA's kinky scene.  She crosses quickly
to the bathroom --

SHAW
You know, I've...I've never really done
this kind of thing before.

-- and reemerges wearing her CATWOMAN mask...which seems
perfectly appropriate in this context.

SELINA
I think people should indulge their
fantasies.  Don't you?

Now that he's all trussed up, she crosses the room and reaches
into an oversized bag.  She withdraws an odd-looking chromium
BRACE, slips it on over her wrist, and hits a trigger.  SIX-
INCH STEEL TALONS snick into place.  SHAW's dopey smile
fades...

SHAW
Hey, what are those -- what are you --

He lets out an awful, shrill SHRIEK as the camera WHIP PANS
away from the bed to a Jackson Pollack on the wall nearby.  A
SPRAY OF BLOOD spatters across it -- in an aesthetically
pleasing way -- and the SHRIEK ends in a LOW GURGLE as we

CUT TO:

INT. BUILDING LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

A SECURITY GUARD is working a crossword at his booth near the
entrance of the building.  Behind him, a bank of MONITORS show
various empty hallways throughout the building.  He reaches
for his coffee and sees a RED LIGHT flashing on a wall panel
nearby.

INT. SHAW'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

The penthouse is THROBBING with the clangorous sound of a
BURGLAR ALARM.  SELINA is standing by an OPEN WALL SAFE --
concealed behind a painting, which has been swung away on
hinges -- and she's HOLDING HER EARS, wearing a look of
complete exasperation: oh, shit.  The GUARD'S VOICE crackles
over a nearby intercom:

GUARD (O.S.; filter)
Mr. Shaw?  What's going on up there?  --
Mr. Shaw?

Furious with herself, she reaches inside the safe and extracts
a BLACK RAVEN statuette -- identical to the one she took on
the docks.  She slams the door shut and swings the picture
back into place.

EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

SIRENS echo in the streets.  SQUAD CARS make sudden turns and
streak off toward SHAW's building.

EXT. ROOFTOP - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Watching the cars from his rooftop vantage, BATMAN raises an
ANTENNA mounted on his utility belt and cups one hand to his
head.  An EARPIECE concealed inside his cowl gives him the
police frequency:

DISPATCHER (O.S.; filter)
-- possible 15 in progress, 188 E. 69th at
Gotham Park West.  Move out.  It's Randall
Shaw.  Repeat, all units --

BATMAN's eyes widen.  He steps to the ledge and pulls a TINY
METAL CYLINDER from his belt -- immediately recognizable as
part of BRUCE's hydraulic umbrella-gizmo.

But it's no umbrella.  When BATMAN thumbs the switch, his
BLACK CAPE begins to SPREAD and RISE -- stiffening, expanding
-- INFLATING itself into a pair of RIGID BLACK BATWINGS.

He steps OFF THE LEDGE, INTO MIDAIR -- SOARING SILENTLY ACROSS
THE STREET LIKE A HUMAN HANG-GLIDER as the cop cars cruise
past far below.

INT. SHAW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

There's an awful BANGING at the front door.  SHAW lies under
the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the
ceiling.  SELINA, now dressed in full Catwoman regalia, slings
a lightweight KNAPSACK over her shoulders.  She picks up the
nearest chair, RAMS IT through SHAW's plate-glass window, and
clambers out onto the ledge outside.

Ten seconds later the COPS burst in.  They rush to the bedroom
-- spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the
bed --

-- but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall.
Painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping BAT.

COP
JESUS!

EXT. ROOFTOP - SHAW'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Forty stories up.  The CATWOMAN, in a surefooted crouch, she
scurries along the ledge -- SPRINGS at a cornice -- and in one
lithe motion VAULTS UP onto the ROOF.  She scampers across the
rooftops, dropping from one to the next with rope and tackle,
like a mountain climber --

-- until she reaches the building at the end of the block.
Here she pauses to dig in her knapsack.  She pulls out a
retractable HOOK at the end of a rope, swings it around,
HEAVES IT at the rooftop across the street...

EXT. STREET BELOW - LOW ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

POLICE pile out of cars and race for the entrance, totally
oblivious to the odd scene taking place overhead -- where the
small, barely-visible figure of a WOMAN, clad entirely in
black leather, is doing a TIGHTROPE WALK across the
intersection.

EXT. ROOFTOP - A MINUTE LATER - NIGHT

The CATWOMAN bounds across snowy rooftops until she decides
she's out of danger.  Then, weary and exhilarated, she drops
to her knees; bathed in moonlight, she preens, stretches,
emits eerie little purrs and hisses of pleasure.  She's just
made a kill and her blood is running high, so she's stopped
for a moment of Quality Time.

She hears an odd crunching noise two roofs over.  Her whole
body tenses and -- though her head doesn't move -- her eyes
dart left.

A CAPED SHADOW has just touched down at the end of a line.
The gold BAT-EMBLEM on his chest is visible for the briefest
of seconds before he steps back into the shadows.  She acts
like she hasn't noticed...

...but a little smile flickers across her lips just the same.

TIGHT ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT

His eyes widen -- his LIPS PART as he watches her.  If it's
possible to see absolute consternation behind that mask, we're
seeing it now.

HIS POV - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT

She still doesn't let on that she's seen him.  Instead, she
goes to the ledge of the roof and begins to STRUT, like a
gymnast on the balance beam -- POSING for him in a little
private show -- a strange, self-infatuated, AUTOEROTIC DANCE
ROUTINE for BATMAN's benefit.

EXT. ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

His jaw is down around his knees.  Whoa.  He edges forward
slightly, as if hypnotically drawn to her...

She hears a noise.  Stops.  Makes a big show of looking left
and right.  Somehow afraid she'll see him watching, BATMAN
jumps back into the shadows.  She gathers her things; a small
WHITE CARD flutters from her knapsack to the snowy roof, and
she VANISHES over the edge.

Snapping back to reality, he bolts across the roof just in
time to see --

EXT. SIDE OF BUILDING - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

She's rapidly working her way down the side of the building,
flipping down from one fire escape to tile next -- a master
gymnast.  Three stories up, she lands on a railing, then STOPS
-- LAUNCHING HERSELF out over the street, making a perfect
landing on the roof of a passing BUS.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BATMAN turns -- and his eyes fall on the WHITE CARD.  He
kneels to pick it up; a brief three-word MESSAGE is scrawled
upon it...

LOOKING FOR LOVE?

He goes goggle-eyed with astonishment.  He rushes back to the
edge of the roof and sees the BUS just turning toward the
entrance to Gotham Park.  He's reaching for his grappling-gun,
figuring to follow, when a FLOODLIGHT catches him full in the
face.

EXT. STREETS BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

Down below, the cops are sweeping their beams across the
rooftops.  Two of them catch a quick glimpse of BATMAN just as
he ducks back behind the cornice, out of view.

COP
Hey.  You see what I saw...?

This sends the astounded COPS rushing to their radios.  Right
on cue, COMMISSIONER GORDON's car pulls up.  LT. BULLOCK,
who's already on the scene, fills him in as he climbs out.

BULLOCK
It's Randall Shaw.  Torn to ribbons.  --
We just made Batman up on the roof.

GORDON
Oh God.

EXT. GOTHAM PARK - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The BUS rumbles deeper into the snowy park.  A BLACK
SILHOUETTE springs off the roof into the trees, disappearing
among the branches...

We TRACK WITH the bus as it moves through the park, arriving
finally at:

EXT. CLEARING IN PARK - SHANTYTOWN - NIGHT

The little colony of HOMELESS PEOPLE in their cardboard shacks
and lean-tos, still occupying the future site of the Park
Towers.  MARCHERS and PICKETERS are continuing their protest
nearby, and some charitable organization's set up a makeshift
soup kitchen on folding tables -- hot coffee and sandwiches.

VICKI's on the periphery of the camp, camera in hand.  She's
trying to persuade a HOMELESS MAN to let his picture be taken.

VICKI
Please, just one.  It's important for
people to see what's happening.

HOMELESS MAN
They don't want to see us, lady.  They
just want us gone -- out of sight, and out
of mind.
(mumbling as he wanders off)
Get worse before it gets better.  It
always does.

VICKI TURNS.  In the distance, the PICKETERS are shrieking and
wailing.  A VAN's just pulled up to the edge of the park, and
a dozen HARDHATS are elbowing their way through the crowd.
All at once they're swarming through shantytown with TIRE
IRONS and BASEBALL BATS, overturning the sandwich tables,
RIPPING DOWN the shabby tents and lean-tos.

Some of the HOMELESS PEOPLE run.  Those who resist meet with
swift and sudden violence.  A MARCHER jumps a hardhat, and
gets a baseball bat in the gut for his trouble.

VICKI waits for the police sirens, but they don't come.  She
backs off toward the trees, she begins SNAPPING PHOTOS
FRANTICALLY, capturing the carnage on film.

A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
He points her out to a colleague...

...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's
slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
are almost upon her...

...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.

The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the
FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
from the second guy's tire iron.

In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
the iron --

-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has
nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
the ground.

The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with
astonishment.

It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at
him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
aid of his fellow homeless...

She can't believe what she's seeing.  The KID wades smack into
the midst of the remaining HARDHATS, and kicks ass --
spinning, pirouetting, kicking, clawing in a furious display
of pure athleticism.  It seems like he's everywhere at once.
There's only one other guy in Gotham City who can handle
himself like this...

Rallying behind him, the MARCHERS and HOMELESS PEOPLE snatch
bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed
resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
race off to their VAN.

Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
trees.

But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID
runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID
throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
him...

CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,
BOARDLIKE.  The KID looks up and sees VICKI standing there
with a baseball bat.

He gives her a quick nod of acknowledgement as he gets to his
feet -- thanks for returning the favor.  He's about to light
out again when --

VICKI
WAIT!  Don't be afraid.  I wanted to thank
you.  I --

KID
(cautiously)
Twenty.

VICKI
What?

KID
Twenty bucks.

VICKI's mildly taken aback, but she reaches for her purse just
the same.  She's barely gotten her wallet open when the KID
snatches the bill out of her hands.  They stare at each other
for a long moment --

VICKI
...Who are you?

KID
Dick.

-- and then he's bounding off like a shot.  VAULTING up into a
tree and vanishing amid the snowy branches.  VICKI starts to
follow, but there's no way she can keep up.  Instead she digs
into her CAMERA BAG...

HER POV - THROUGH TELEPHOTO LENS

Using the long lens, she tracks the KID's progress through the
treetops.  She can't actually see him, but occasional chunks
of SNOW and ICE are falling to the ground as he jumps from
limb to limb...

For a moment it seems like she's lost him.  As she sweeps the
lens back and forth, scanning the trees, she catches sight of
an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.  She ups the
magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.  The
stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE
-- BRUCE's great-grandfather.

As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.  He
looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
hillocks, over a frozen creek.

There's a DRAINAGE TUNNEL, four or five feet in diameter,
mounted in the bridge abutment, the KID pries off a wire grate
and clambers inside, then pulls the grate back into place
behind him.  Home sweet home.

EXT. PARK - ON VICKI - NIGHT

as she lowers the lens.  Her face is full of conflicting
emotions.  She'd love to corner this boy vigilante and find
out what his story is.  But on the other hand -- even the
homeless are entitled to their privacy...

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S AVIARY - NIGHT

A CANARY sings in its cage as a BLACK CAT watches transfixed
from a nearby chair.  The cat arches its back -- waits -- and
SPRINGS AT THE CAGE, BATTING at it in midair.  The canary
SHRIEKS; the cat YOWLS; a WOMAN snatches it up off the floor,
cradles it in her arms...

WOMAN'S VOICE
Now Hecate.  You don't want that scrawny
little bird --

It's SELINA, looking ripe and slinky in a sheer black
ensemble.  At the desk behind her is the PENGUIN, in his
customary cutaway and waist-coat, polishing his new RAVEN.  He
bares his teeth:

PENGUIN
Do you want me to wring that creature's
neck?

SELINA
You try it, I'll do the same to you.
(as he grumbles; bemused)
I saw him, you know.

PENGUIN
Saw who?

SELINA
Batman.  He was dreamy.

She strokes the cat, in a reverie.  The PENGUIN drops his
polishing cloth, startled.

PENGUIN
Dreamy?!?  Are you insane!?  My God --
(sputtering wildly)
Are you sure it was him?  What did he do?

SELINA
He stood on a roof and watched me.  He
didn't realize I'd seen him.  I don't
think he knew quite what to make of me.
(smiling)
But he was definitely interested.

This sends the PENGUIN into a frantic round of pacing.  (Or
waddling.)

PENGUIN
This scheme of yours is backfiring.  We
don't need him on our tails.  Do you know
how much money is at stake here?

SELINA
Money isn't everything.
(casually)
What's the point if we can't enjoy
ourselves?

She chuckles to herself.  He stares at her in disbelief -- and
SQUAWKS.

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - MORNING

The big SIGN over Gotham Square tells us there are only 9
shopping days left until Christmas.  Down below, BRUCE is
walking VICKI to work.

VICKI
Six-on-one, and he took 'em all out...then
vanished into a drainage pipe -- right
next to the statue of General Wayne.

BRUCE
My illustrious great-grandfather.  Think
it's the same kid we heard about?

VICKI
Must be.  He reminded me of you.

BRUCE chuckles. They pass a NEWSSTAND just outside the Globe
building, pausing to stare at the headlines -- which SCREAM:

NEW BAT-MURDER?
Batman Suspect in Slaying of Millionaire Developer
Commissioner Gordon Refuses Comment

The accompanying photo is a full-color spread of the BLOODY
RED BAT painted on SHAW's wall.  BRUCE scowls at VICKI:

BRUCE
-- You work for this rag?
(snatching up a paper)
Your boss is calling for Gordon's
resignation -- unless he brings Batman in
for questioning...

VICKI nudges BRUCE and points at a STOREFRONT across the
street.

THEIR POV - SOUVENIR SHOP

The owner is in the store window, hastily removing all of his
Batman merchandise and setting up new displays devoted to
TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES and THE SIMPSONS.  A MOTHER drags
her squirming TODDLER past the entrance -- the kid smells
heavy markdowns on Bat-shit, but Mom clearly doesn't
approve...

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND VICKI

looking on in dismay.  BRUCE crumples the paper in outrage:

BRUCE
I need a good PR man.

NEWS VENDOR
Hey, pal -- you buyin' or borrowin'?

With a sullen look, BRUCE tosses the paper back on the rack.
VICKI pulls him off toward the entrance of the Globe.

VICKI
That's what happens when you go after the
rich and powerful.

BRUCE
Hey, it wasn't me, remember?  I am rich
and powerful --

As he's talking, BRUCE glances back at the newsstand.  He sees
an AD FLYER tacked up on one side -- ""LOOKING FOR LOVE?  Find
it in the GOTHAM GLOBE PERSONALS.""

Looking for Love.  Eyes widening, he digs in his pocket for a
quarter and races back to the newsstand.  VICKI keeps
walking...

VICKI
Maybe it's almost...good.  In a weird way.
I mean, Shaw, and Barrett -- if people
like that were really scared, maybe
they'd --

She suddenly realizes she's talking to herself.  She turns
around and sees BRUCE back at the newsstand, hurriedly
unfolding a copy of the Globe.  She marches back and tugs at
his sleeve.

VICKI (cont.)
Hey, I'm late for work.  You can read that
later.

BRUCE
Quiet.  I'm looking for a personal ad.

Her face screws up in confusion as BRUCE frantically scans the
page.

BRUCE (cont.)
""Tall, Dark And Handsome -- You saw me on
the roof 12/16.  I was in black; you were
too.""

VICKI
Is this some kind of bad joke?

BRUCE
It's her.  That cat woman, or whatever she
is.
(reading aloud)
""I jumped a bus into Gotham Park hoping
you'd follow, but you were too shy...""

VICKI
What does she want -- a date?

BRUCE
She's trying to contact me.  Says she's
gonna leave me another ad...

The two of them exchange a look of utter perplexity.  BRUCE's
mind is racing; he seems bizarrely aroused -- in a way that
makes VICKI just a trifle nervous...

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY

VICKI arrives at her desk and sets her portfolio down.  She
spots a message in the ""in"" file.  She takes one look at it,
and her eyes go wide with RAGE.  She storms out in a fury...

INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - A MINUTE LATER - DAY

Barging past a phalanx of SECRETARIES, VICKI bursts into the
inner office of HARRISON J. PROVOST, publisher of the Globe.
He's just opening his mail.  He heaves a weary sigh as VICKI
BARKS at him:

VICKI
WHY DID YOU KILL MY STORY?

PROVOST
Close the door.
(waiting for her to calm down)
Your story isn't news.  With Shaw dead --

VICKI
But the project's still going ahead!  If
attacking homeless people in the park
isn't news, I'd like to know what is --

PROVOST
There's a psycho out there in a mask and
cape -- killing off Gotham's most
prominent citizens!  That's news.
(beat)
I've known Randall Shaw all my life.  His
family is in mourning.  And it just so
happens I don't believe in slandering the
dead.

VICKI FUMES.  She turns and stares PROVOST straight in the
eye.

VICKI
Mr. Provost -- how much money do you have
tied up in the Park Tower project?

PROVOST
Vicki...I'm going to forget you made that
remark.  For the sake of your job, I
suggest you do the same.

VICKI stalks of -- and PROVOST goes back to his mail.  He
finds an envelope addressed in a shaky, psychotic scrawl, with
the word ""CONFIDENTIAL"" underlined three times in ink.  He
tears it open --

-- and HIS FACE TURNS PALE as he stares down at the contents:
a small business-sized card, signed with a BAT-EMBLEM...

THOSE WHO FEED ON THE SOUL OF GOTHAM
WILL SUFFER MY WRATH

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

WALTER BARRETT and his ATTORNEY emerge onto the front steps of
the courthouse.  BARRETT is instantly mobbed by REPORTERS.

REPORTER I
Mr. Barrett!  Any comment on the
arraignment?

REPORTER II
Is it true bail was set at two million
dollars?

ATTORNEY
Stand back!  My client has nothing to say
at this time!

The ATTORNEY clears a path for BARRETT, who climbs into a
waiting CAR, shielding his face.  REPORTERS cluster around
it...

As the car pulls out into traffic, we see a flock of PIGEONS
taking wing from their perches on the statues outside the Hall
of Justice.

OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR

PIGEONS fill the frame, swooping down toward the CAR, which is
idling at a traffic light far below.

INT. BARRETT'S CAR - THAT MOMENT

The liveried DRIVER drums his fingers as he waits for the
light to change.  BARRETT's in the back, speaking into his
cellular phone.

BARRETT
It's time we called an emergency meeting
of the Raven Society.  Get back to me...

Looking troubled, he hangs up.  A fat white glob of PIGEON
SHIT splatters across the windshield.  Seconds later --
another SPLAT.

BARRETT (cont.)
Damn pigeons.

DRIVER
Just washed it, too.

The DRIVER reaches for the wiper switch.  They hear a tiny
DINK as a SOLID PELLET bounces off the windshield.

BARRETT and the DRIVER exchange a mystified look.  A small,
blinking CAPSULE has just lodged in the wiper-blade
assembly...

OVERHEAD SHOT - ON BARRETT'S CAR

Just as the light changes, the CAR EXPLODES into a million
fragments -- leaving a BLACKENED CRATER in the middle of the
intersection.

CUT TO:

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

TIGHT ON A VIDEO MONITOR -- showing FIRE TRUCKS in the
intersection we've just left, hosing down the wreckage of
BARRETT's car.  BRUCE is watching intently when ALFRED appears
behind him.

ALFRED
The Fluegelheim called again, sir.  They
want to know if you'll be attending the
opening of the new Egyptian exhibit.

BRUCE, still engrossed in his news broadcast, waves ALFRED
off.

BRUCE
Cancel.

ANCHORWOMAN (on TV)
-- and, citing new evidence in the so-
called string of ""millionaire murders,""
Police Commissioner J.T. Gordon today
swore out a warrant for the arrest of
Batman.
(beat)
We go now live to Mike Sekowsky,
spokesperson, Order of the Bat.

SEKOWSKY
Jeez!  Talk about gratitude -- !!

At the sight of SEKOWSKY's face, BRUCE kills the sound in
disgust.  ALFRED looks on helplessly as he paces the floor of
the Batcave.

BRUCE
Well, Alfred, it's official.  I'm a wanted
man.
(beat)
""New evidence""...I've gotta find that
woman.  Did you check the personals?

As ALFRED shakes his head no, a BUZZER sounds.  They've got a
visitor.  BRUCE hits a switch on a monitor, and sees
COMMISSIONER GORDON'S CAR sitting outside the wrought-iron
gates of Wayne Manor.

He throws a nervous look at ALFRED.  ALFRED speaks into a
microphone:

ALFRED
Who's there?

GORDON
Jim Gordon, Alfred.  I've got to see
Bruce.

A spooky development.  Does GORDON suspect?  After a moment's
hesitation, BRUCE nods to ALFRED -- let him in.

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne will see you, sir.

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

A curious BRUCE ushers GORDON into the library, gestures
toward the liquor cabinet.  The Commissioner nods his head no.
He's fidgety, ill at ease -- he obviously doesn't want to be
here.

GORDON
Sorry to bother you.  Bruce -- I'll get
right down to it.  You knew Shaw and
Barrett --

BRUCE
I saw them occasionally.  We all sat on
the board of the Fluegelheim...

GORDON
Did you have any...dealings with them,
or --

BRUCE
No.  I never liked the way they did
business.

GORDON
The thing is, Bruce, you're all lumped
together in the public mind -- the Five
Families of Gotham, that sort of thing --
and, uh...
(taking a card from his pocket)
Harrison Provost got this in the mail.

BRUCE examines the card, -- ""THOSE WHO FEED,"" etc.  He stares
at GORDON in mock-concern, playing it close to the vest...

BRUCE
Then Batman is behind all this.

GORDON
Batman or a damned good imitation.

BRUCE
Well.  He's changed tactics, hasn't he.

GORDON
(shrugging; at a loss)
Shaw, with his high-rises -- Barrett, a
druglord, major polluter -- they weren't
exactly model citizens.  Who knows, it
could be some crazy social-conscience kind
of thing.

BRUCE
You mean he's going after...the root of
the problem.

GORDON shakes his head and gets up to go.  BRUCE hands him the
card.

GORDON
Let me know if you get one of these.
We'll put all our resources at your
disposal.

BRUCE nods thoughtfully as ALFRED appears to see the
Commissioner out.  A moment later, the butler reappears.

BRUCE
Changed my mind, Alfred.  I'll be dropping
in on the Fluegelheim after all.

CUT TO:

INT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

It's a party to celebrate the opening of the new Egyptian
exhibit, and the Fluegelheim is hopping.  BOARD MEMBERS,
MUSEUM PATRONS, and SOCIALITES mill about in dinner jackets
and evening gowns, making small talk.  AN OPEN SARCOPHAGUS has
been set up as a wet bar.

On a raised concrete platform in the center of the hall,
rimmed by a decorative moat, sits an ancient Egyptian SHRINE.
The TEMPLE OF BASTET has been moved to Gotham and
reconstructed in the Fluegelheim --sandstone walls, fountains,
statuary and all.

Guarding the entrance is a stately bronze statue of the
goddess BASTET -- who has the body of a woman and the head of
a pointy-eared CAT.  She holds an aegis and a sistrum; four
tiny KITTENS romp at her feet.  BRUCE, who's just arrived, is
taking an intense interest in the cat-goddess...

VICKI
What is it?

BRUCE
I just had a weird sense of deja vu.

He glances over by the sarcophagus and sees PROVOST, the
publisher, huddle with ELIOT TIPTREE III, transit magnate --
the remaining member of Gotham's ""Five Families.""  The two of
them are engaged in some urgent conversation which he can't
quite make out...

TIPTREE
Harrison -- we really ought to warn Bruce.
We owe him that much.

BRUCE detaches himself from VICKI and strolls toward them.
PROVOST and TIPTREE force smiles and wave, affecting an air of
nonchalance.

PROVOST (cont.)
The man's a space cadet.  Let him look out
for himself.
(as BRUCE arrives; cheerfully)
Why, Bruce!  What a delightful surprise.

BRUCE
Good to see you two.  Looks like the Five
Families are suddenly down to three.
(looking around)
In fact, if somebody dropped a bomb on
this room right now --

TIPTREE chuckles nervously.  PROVOST is even less amused.

PROVOST
Is that your idea of a joke, Bruce?

BRUCE
Not at all.  Commissioner Gordon seems to
think we should all be hiring bodyguards.

TIPTREE                           PROVOST
Oh, that's absurd.                I already have.

The two of them glower at each other.  It's like an outtake
from The Newlywed Game.  BRUCE shrugs it off and makes a
vacuous face:

BRUCE
Thing is, I can't imagine why Batman would
be after us.  Can you?

PROVOST and TIPTREE are about to go into another round of
hemming-and-hawing when a NEW FACE joins the party.  It's
SELINA KYLE -- stunning as ever in an extravagantly revealing
dress slit up to the armpits.  She's holding two glasses of
CHAMPAGNE...

SELINA
You two look like you need a drink.  --
And is this who I think it is?

She flashes BRUCE her most winning, seductive, heavy-artillery
SMILE.  He BLINKS, temporarily speechless.

PROVOST
Selina Kyle -- Bruce Wayne.

SELINA
Our absentee board member!  I've been
wanting to meet you forever.

TIPTREE
Selina's the new Curator of Antiquities.
She brought the Temple over block by
block --

SELINA
You two won't be terribly upset if I
borrow Bruce for a moment, will you?

Before he can protest, she's linked an arm around his and
dragged him off.  A nearby FAT MAN spots SELINA, wiggles his
eyebrows and WAVES BRIGHTLY.  His tongue is practically
hanging out -- he's just dying to write her a check.  SELINA
SIGHS WEARILY to BRUCE:

SELINA (cont.)
Major contributor.  -- I always seem to
wind up in charge of fund-raising...

BRUCE
I can't imagine why.

SELINA
Tax year's almost over, you know.  I hope
we can count on your usual generous
donation.
(indicating PROVOST and TIPTREE)
Someone's got to set an example for those
two tightwads.

BRUCE
They're proccupied.  This string of
murders --

SELINA
I asked them if they'd consider including
us in their wills.
(chuckling to herself)
They didn't seem a bit amused...

ANGLE ON VICKI - THAT MOMENT

She's making small talk with a bunch of STUFFED SHIRTS and
their overdressed WIVES.  She glances across the room at the
statue of Bastet, sees SELINA draped all over BRUCE.  A frown
crosses her face...

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SELINA - THAT MOMENT

She's still clinging to his arm as they stare up at the
statue.

SELINA
-- and this is my good friend Bastet, the
Egyptian Cat Goddess.

BRUCE
I think we've already met.  -- This is
quite an expedition you've put together.

SELINA
I'm glad you think so.  I have to say,
Bruce -- you're not at all what I
expected.

BRUCE
Sorry to disappoint you.

SELINA
Oh, it's not that.  Not at all.  It's just
that I'd always heard you were...

BRUCE
What?

SELINA
(coyly)
Oh...sort of a...

BRUCE
(smiling; fascinated)
No.  Come on.  What?

BRUCE's state of mounting infatuation is abruptly shattered
when VICKI sidles up alongside him and -- territorially --
takes his other arm.  The women exchange big, toothy, plastic
smiles; stranded in the middle, BRUCE realizes they're waiting
for him to introduce them.

BRUCE
Oh.  Selina Kyle -- my friend Vicki Vale.

SELINA
The photographer.  I've seen your pictures
in the Gazette.

VICKI
The Globe.

SELINA
Oh, that's right.  The tabloid one.  --
What an original dress!

VICKI, still smiling, cocks an eyebrow at BRUCE.  He senses
trouble coming and tries to head it off at the pass.

BRUCE
Selina supervised the reconstruction of
the temple.  Brought it back from Egypt...
stone by stone.

VICKI
Really.  She must be awfully tired.
(to SELINA)
How'd you get to be in charge of a huge
project like this?

SELINA
It was easy.  I slept with the Pharoah.

She laughs at her own joke.  VICKI responds with a dry little
chuckle of her own.  SELINA gives BRUCE a SHARP YANK on the
sleeve.

SELINA (cont.)
Excuse us, won't you, sweetheart?  We have
some boring museum business to talk about.

VICKI fumes.  BRUCE shrugs apologetically as SELINA drags him
off out of earshot.

SELINA (cont.)
I.  Short leash.

BRUCE
Pull in the claws, okay?  She's really
terrific.

SELINA
I'm sorry, Bruce.  Sometimes I get a
little...aggressive, you know?
(handing him a card)
Look, I need to talk to you.  Come by
sometime.  I'll give you the private tour.

BRUCE
Wait.  Let me explain about Vicki --

SELINA
(shushing him)
I understand.  Anyone who's that
protective must have a pretty good reason
for it.

She shoots him one last smile -- sly, conspiratorial,
unmistakably juicy.  Then she's off in pursuit of another
major funder.  BRUCE is thoughtfully turning the card over in
his hands when VICKI rejoins him.

VICKI
How's ""business""?

BRUCE
Relax, okay?  I like you better.

He scans the room, trying to find PROVOST and TIPTREE.  No
luck.

VICKI
If you're looking for your fellow
millionaires, they left some time back.

CUT TO:

INT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The roof of the Gotham Globe.  A STARLING circles overhead for
a moment -- then DIVES down an exposed VENTILATION SHAFT.

INT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT

TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS are standing watch outside an office.
Brass letters on the door read ""J. HARRISON PROVOST,
PUBLISHER.""

INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

PROVOST, agitated, working late.  He speaks, sotto voce, into
the phone:

PROVOST
Don't worry about that.  I've had the
office swept for bugs.  No one's
listening...

INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIPTREE in his paneled study at home.  There's an open bottle
on the table and he's been hitting the sauce -- hard.  His
VOICE QUAVERS:

TIPTREE
It's just so -- unfair.  I mean...it was
over a century ago.  It's not like we're
responsible.
(hollow-eyed)
How could he know?  How could Batman know
about the Raven Society??

INT. OFFICE - ON PROVOST - THAT MOMENT

PROVOST
Who knows and who cares.  The point is,
it's happened...

He hears a CHIRP and looks up.  It seems to be coming from a
HEATING VENT on the wall.  But then it stops, so he resumes
his conversation --

PROVOST (cont.)
I'm clearing out of the country, and I'm
taking the raven with me.  I suggest you
do the same.

INT. HEATING VENT - THAT MOMENT

In the metal shaft on the other side of the grate is a tiny
BIRD -- the same one we saw flying down the air shaft.  Now
that we've got a close-up view, we can see the thin BATTERY
PACK wired to its underbelly...and the MINIATURE MICROPHONE
taped to its leg.

PROVOST (O.S.)
I'll tell you how to reach me.  And don't
repeat this to anyone.

CUT TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - DAY

The PENGUIN stands over his indoor penguin pool.  He's wearing
rubber gloves, feeding LIVE FISH from an ice chest to his
arctic birds.  The vents in the windows are open, and the
climate in the room is downright icy as SELINA's wrapped in
fur, stroking her pet cat:

SELINA
He's just another rich idiot.
(chuckling to herself)
The odd thing is, he didn't seem a bit
concerned.

PENGUIN
Then he is an idiot.

SELINA
He lives in some big sprawling manor.
I'll have to get inside, scope it out...
see where he's got the raven stashed.

PENGUIN
How do you plan to do that?

SELINA
How do you think!

A feline smile from SELINA.  The PENGUIN chuckles to himself,
lobs a FISH out over the pool.  A swooping GULL snatches it
out of the air before it hits the water.  FRICK arrives in the
doorway.

FRICK
It's Mr. Provost, sir.  He's planning to
embark on an unscheduled Christmas
vacation.

PENGUIN
Good!  That should save us a trip to the
bank.

CUT TO:

INT. FLUEGELHEIM - BACK ROOM - DAY

A huge open room cluttered with all kinds of junk:
archaeologist's tools, restoration equipment, etc., plus a
healthy assortment of curios and oddities from all over.  This
is SELINA's private domain.  CAMERA TRACKS past a glass case
full of ugly, withered, turdlike specimens...

BRUCE
What have we got here?

SELINA
Mummified cats.  Bastet's sacred animal.
They were buried by the thousands at
Bubastis.  -- Oh, careful!

BRUCE FREEZES with his hand poised over a set of four earthen
JARS.  Each has a lid carved in the shape of a HEAD: ape,
jackal, man, falcon.

SELINA (cont.)
Canopic jars.  In the process of
mummification, the internal organs were
buried separately.
(pointing to each jar in turn)
Lungs -- stomach -- liver -- intestine --

BRUCE withdraws his hand with a bemused shudder.

BRUCE
You're in a gruesome line of work.

SELINA
Keeps me interested.  And that's not easy
to do...

BRUCE's attention turns to a crumbling statuette of an odd
beast: a WINGED LION with the head of a FALCON.

BRUCE
This one I know.  It's a gryphon, right?

SELINA
Very good.  A mythical demon, half-bird,
half-lion...sweeping down from the sky to
deliver retribution and justice.

BRUCE nods.  He can dig it.  He regards the gryphon for a long
moment and CHUCKLES.

BRUCE
Poor guy.  Birds and cats -- you wouldn't
think the two halves would cooperate.

SELINA
Only under certain circumstances.
(beat)
I'm really glad you came, Bruce.  I was
afraid I'd given you the wrong impression.
Or maybe it was the right impression.

BRUCE
What was it you wanted to talk to me
about?

SELINA
Your collection.  I'd love to see it.  I
mean, everyone says you've got a
fabulous --

She breaks off in midstream and chuckles to herself.  She toys
demurely with her equipment.  She looks up at BRUCE and
switches tactics -- going for the direct approach.  BRUCE
braces himself...

SELINA (cont.)
Mainly I just wanted an excuse to see you
again.  Does she know you're here --
Vicki?

BRUCE
(shrugging)
No.

SELINA
It must be strange.  Having all that
power, and money -- never really knowing
if that's what people are attracted to.

BRUCE
What are you attracted to?

SELINA
I think you're a little bit nuts.
(beat)
I think you're a little -- bored with your
life.  Having everything you want.  No
variety, no...danger.  And every once in a
while you need to take a risk.  Shake it
all up.

BRUCE
How?

SELINA
Maybe by...coming here today.

She leans back against a crate, moistens her lips.  She's
letting him have it with both barrels.

SELINA (cont.)
That's one thing I can give you, Bruce --
danger -- a little something you can't get
at home.

BRUCE hesitates -- but the lure is irresistible.  He moves
forward slowly; SELINA's eyes close; their lips draw slowly
closer...

...and he SNEEZES IN HER FACE.  She backs off in shock as he
covers his face.  His eyes are watering and he's WHEEZING.
She rushes over --

SELINA
Are you okay?

BRUCE
Is there a cat in here?

Right on cue, SELINA's black cat HECATE lets out a loud MEOW
-- and STRETCHES against BRUCE's pants leg.  He brushes the
animal aside and it LEAPS into SELINA's arms.  BRUCE sniffles
uncontrollably.

BRUCE (cont.)
Get it away!

She drops the cat, which scampers off.  BRUCE rubs his eyes.

SELINA
Poor thing.  You're allergic!

BRUCE
Yeah, cats...ever since I was a kid...
(snorting and weeping)
Look, I'd better get some fresh air.
Maybe another time, okay...

He heads for the door before SELINA can stop him.  He's gone,
but she knows she's left a dent in his armor.  She smiles in
bemusement as HECATE jumps into her arms and PURRS.

EXT. FLUEGELHEIM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

BRUCE stumbles out the museum feeling mildly discombobulated.
He marches down the front steps past a NEWSSTAND -- where he
stops to buy a copy of the afternoon GLOBE.

He opens it to the PERSONAL ADS and finds what he's been
waiting for:

TALL, DARK, AND HANDSOME -- Christmas is coming.
Why don't we trim the tree together?

This puzzles him for a moment -- until he looks up the street.
In the distance, at the very center of Gotham Square, WORKMEN
are stringing lights around an enormous CHRISTMAS TREE, almost
fifty feet tall.

The LIGHTING CEREMONY is an annual event in Gotham.  BRUCE
smiles slightly, tucks the paper under one arm and walks to
his car.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT

SNOW falls on a huge CROWD gathered around the big tree.  The
tree won't be lit for another twenty minutes or so, and so the
ONLOOKERS are singing CHRISTMAS CAROLS from printed lyric
sheets.

A BAND is playing on a makeshift ORCHESTRA PLATFORM erected in
front of the tree, leading the crowd in a spirited rendition
of ""God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen.""  The Square is rocking with
good will toward men.  When they get to the part about saving
us all from Satan's power --

EXT. ROOFTOP OVERLOOKING SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

-- the CAMERA TILTS UPWARD to BATMAN, watching the action from
his usual gargoyle's perch.  He's scanning the streets and the
rooftops, waiting tor the CATWOMAN to make her move --
whatever it is.

He glances at the building directly across the square from
him.  On the roof is a neon sign reading Gotham City Globe in
ornate old-English letters -- and above that, a ROTATING METAL
SCULPTURE of the world turning.  His eyes rove downward along
the facade of the building...

EXT. GOTHAM GLOBE - THAT MOMENT

At street level, an ARMORED CAR has pulled up in front of the
Globe offices.  THREE SECURITY GUARDS with rifles climb out of
the ARMORED CAR, followed by a FOURTH -- who has an OBLONG BOX
handcuffed to his wrist.  Of course, we can't see what's
inside, but to those of us in the know the box looks just
about the right size for a RAVEN STATUETTE.

The GUARDS scan the street and enter the building without
incident.  As they do, a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN crosses the
frame; mounted on its side is an ADVERTISING PLACARD which
reads:

BATMAN: HERO OR MENACE?
Read All About It in the GOTHAM GLOBE!

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

He watches with some curiosity.  An armored car: is this some
part of the CATWOMAN's scheme?  But no...the GUARDS are safely
inside the building, and the CAR is leaving.  He settles back
to wait.

INT. NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN - THAT MOMENT

The innocuous-looking VAN rounds the corner of the Globe
building.  FRICK is at the wheel, FRACK is riding shotgun, and
the PENGUIN is between them, peering out eagerly through the
windshield.

They turn into the Globe's BASEMENT GARAGE -- where dozens of
similar vans are parked at the LOADING BAYS.  Just part of the
fleet...

INT. PROVOST'S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

The quartet of SECURITY GUARDS arrive at PROVOST's office.
The publisher has already packed his suitcases for a speedy
getaway.  The LEAD GUARD -- the one cuffed to the RAVEN BOX --
sets his precious cargo on a desk and stands discreetly at
arm's length while PROVOST unlocks it and checks its contents.

Satisfied, he slams it shut.  He reaches into his top drawer
for an ENVELOPE, which he hands to his PERSONAL SECRETARY.

PROVOST
Open this in an hour.  Phone my wife and
tell her where to meet me.
(to the GUARDS; edgily)
No trouble on the way, I take it?

LEAD GUARD
No sir, Mr. Provost.  We came straight
from the bank vault.

GUARD II
'Copter should be just touching down.
We'll have you safely out of here in no
time.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

""Here Comes Santa Claus"" echoes up from the streets.  BATMAN
watches as a COPTER descends toward the HELIPAD on the roof of
the Globe...

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

PROVOST and the LEAD GUARD with the raven box are at an
elevator bank.  The other GUARDS head for a stairwell.

GUARD II
We'll check the stairs.  See you on the
roof.

The LEAD GUARD starts to press the UP button, but PROVOST
pulls a key from his pocket instead:

PROVOST
No -- my private elevator.  It's safer.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

shooting DOWN on the car as it rises.  The shaft above it is
filled with BIRDS -- starlings, crows, pigeons and the like,
swooping and gliding among the gears and cables...

EXT. ROOF OF GLOBE BUILDING - THAT MOMENT

In BG, the helicopter on its pad, idling noisily, the rotors
still spinning.  In FG, the small dormer-like structure that
houses the STAIRWAY.  The metal access door opens, and the
first of the GUARDS steps warily out, rifle at the ready.  He
smiles back at his pal.

GUARD
No way.  They don't pay us enough to
tangle with Batm--

A black-gloved, CHROME-TALONED HAND snakes around the edge of
the dormer and RAKES ACROSS HIS THROAT...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

SWEAT beads up on PROVOST's lip as the GUARD hits the up
button and the car begins to rise.  Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO
OUT.  The car stops with a lurch.

PROVOST
What is it??  What's happening??

Suddenly, there in the darkness, they hear a series of loud
POPPING SOUNDS...which could be gunfire...

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - ON CROWD

singing ""Here Comes Santa Claus"" at the top of their lungs.
Happy faces beam.  No one hears anything unusual over the
music...

EXT. ROOFTOP - ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN

BATMAN straining to listen.  We get another faint series of
POPS -- barely audible over the CAROLING from below, and the
loud PUTT-PUTT-PUTT of the helicopter blades.

He can't really be sure he's heard anything at all.  He scans
the roof of the Globe building, but he can't see what's
happening beyond the big steel globe sculpture and the neon
sign...

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

The CATWOMAN lets fly with another burst of automatic fire
from the dead GUARD's rifle.  The helicopter is still idling,
but no one's left to fly it -- the rooftop is littered with
stiffs...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

PITCH BLACK.  Pre-verbal GROANS and MURMURINGS OF FEAR issue
from the darkness.  An EERIE RED LIGHT kicks on -- the
emergency generators -- and we see PROVOST backed up in a
corner of the car, twitching and jumping like a crazed
spastic.  The GUARD, in a futile effort to placate him, points
up at the LIGHT:

GUARD
There.  Mr. Provost.  See?  The
generator's kicked in.  It's just an
electrical problem.

PROVOST is only marginally consoled.  They hear a strange
TWITTERING NOISE in the shaft above them...

PROVOST starts babbling again.  The GUARD slaps him across the
face.  But the TWITTERING has him a bit concerned as well.  He
stares up at the ceiling of the car as he PUNCHES BUTTONS on
the panel; with another LURCH, the car begins to move.

GUARD
There.  See?  It's moving.  We're fine.

PROVOST
It's going down.  We're going DOWN!!!

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

The BIRDS in the shaft have all ROOSTED on the TOP OF THE CAR.
They're patiently riding it down as it descends...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

The car stops again.  PROVOST is totally losing it.  The
exasperated GUARD grabs him and SHAKES HIM.

GUARD
Okay, Mr. Provost -- I'm gonna have a look
through the trap door.  But I need you to
help me.  Okay?  You have to help.

PROVOST nods and tries to get a grip on himself.  The GUARD
looks up at the trap door in the ceiling of the car.  He can't
reach it...

He uncuffs the BOX containing PROVOST'S RAVEN from his wrist
-- and STANDS on it.  Still short.  Unholstering his gun and
using it as a prod, he can almost reach the trap door.  He
JUMPS UP and, poking with the gun, manages to dislodge the
panel slightly.

More TWITTERING.  PROVOST and the guard look up through the
tiny crack in the ceiling and see nothing but darkness.

GUARD
Probably just some bird that's gotten in
the shaft.  Now calm down.  You'll have to
give me a boost.

The GUARD climbs back atop the raven box.  PROVOST gives him a
boost and he manages to catch hold of the lip of the trap
door.

GUARD (cont.)
Okay, help me out...steady...

PROVOST wraps both arms around the GUARD's wriggling LEGS and
tries to hoist him upward.

INT. SHAFT - ON ROOF OF CAR - THAT MOMENT

From a vantage level with the roof of the car, we see the
GUARD'S FINGERS, clinging to the lip of the trap door.  Now
his HEAD rises into view, pushing the panel aside as he pulls
himself upward.

He peers around.  His BROW wrinkles as he sees a bizarre sight
-- PASSELS of SQUAWKING BIRDS, walking back and forth in front
of him, STRUTTING and PREENING mere inches from his face...

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

The bottom half of the GUARD dangles from the ceiling.
PROVOST still has his arms wrapped around the GUARD's knees.
All at once, the GUARD begins to SCREAM -- his body JERKS and
his legs KICK WILDLY.  Still PROVOST struggles to hang on --
even as BLOOD spatters across the top of his bald dome...

Finally, the GUARD's violent spasms are too much.  PROVOST
trips over the raven box, stumbles backward and lands on his
ass in a corner of the car.  The GUARD tumbles in a heap to
the elevator floor, his face PECKED and CLAWED beyond
recognition, his eyes gone altogether.

PROVOST lets out a series of SHRIEKS.  He peers at the open
trap door, sees the BIRDS staring curiously down at him, and
SHRIEKS AGAIN.

The EMERGENCY TELEPHONE rings.  He stares at it.  It rings
again.  Shielding his eyes and screwing up his courage,
PROVOST crawls across the floor and reaches for the receiver.

PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
Sixteenth floor.  Linens, housewares,
ladies' lingerie!

PROVOST
W-who is this??

INT. GLOBE - BASEMENT LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT

NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all
driverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical
equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been
LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's
private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The
PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE.

PENGUIN
Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of
that car alive, I suggest you follow my
instructions to the letter.

As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on
the concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been
lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper
production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the
other side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door...

PENGUIN (cont.)
SHUT UP IN THERE.
(calmly; into phone)
You should see a cord hanging just behind
you.

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned
CORD descending through the trap door.

PROVOST
Yes -- yes, I see it --

PENGUIN (V.O; filter)
Tie the cord to the handle of your box.

PROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens
to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the
box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him
into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone.

PENGUIN (V.O.; filter)
When you're done, I want you to give two
sharp yanks on the cord.

Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it
twice.

PROVOST
Who are you??  Why are you doing this??

INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN

Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and
BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs
into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine.

PENGUIN
Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call
me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly
frank -- I'm doing this because I hate
Garfield.

Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the
mouthpiece of the phone.

INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT

A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the
elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging
themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined
space.

PROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his
hair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the
panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy...

All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor
has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL.

INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN

PENGUIN
Going down!

He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from
the ELEVATOR DOORS.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT

The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets
uncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making
a quick exit from the trap door in the roof...

INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT

The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the
dormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of
ELEVATOR DOORS...

...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making
for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches
inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it
in.

She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at
her trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like
the first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down,
RATTLES THE SHAFT...

She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the
roof.

EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN

He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight
from the Globe roof across the square.  Something weird is
definitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post --

-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The
big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the
seconds:

CROWD
Ten!  Nine!...

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND

A ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has
stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities.
A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the ""BATMAN -- HERO OR
MENACE?"" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of
papers on the curb.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE

EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off:

CROWD
...Three!  Two!  One!

The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into
CHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of
""JINGLE BELLS.""

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND

The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone
else when a second newspaper van rumbles past...

NEWS VENDOR
Hey!  No!  I aleady got a --

He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing
RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door --

The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk
with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read
""BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE.""

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING

The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded
a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square.
The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence --

-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID,
CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE

The CAROLERS break into MASS HYSTERIA as HIDEOUS BATS swoop
down from above, CLAWING at their heads and shoulders.
ORCHESTRA MEMBERS drop their instruments and stagger off the
BAND PLATFORM, falling into the branches of the giant
Christmas tree.

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON SIDEWALKS

CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS are teeming in and out of nearby STORES.
They drop their SHOPPING BAGS and race about in utter CHAOS as
the bats attack.  WOMEN SCREAM.  CHILDREN SCREAM.  MEN SCREAM
TOO.

A MAN staggers backward through a GLASS STOREFRONT and lands
on his butt in a WINDOW DISPLAY -- a big mechanical SANTA
CLAUS on his North-Pole throne, chuckling merrily in a
prerecorded voice: ""HO HO HO.""  The MAN STRUGGLES WILDLY as
the BATS converge on him.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THAT MOMENT

HORRIFIED SHOPPERS scatter through the aisles as the BATS pour
in through the broken window.  WOMEN lined up for a FREE
MAKEOVER squeal in panic as BATS arrive to rearrange their
hairdos.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON BATMAN

He stares down stunned at the PANDEMONIUM raging below.  He
glances across the street...and sees the TINY SILHOUETTE of a
WOMAN standing atop the cast-iron GLOBE SCULPTURE, LAUGHING at
the chaos, TAUNTING him.

EXT. STREETS - OVERHEAD ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

A few blocks away from Gotham Square.  SIRENS HOWL.  There's a
steady stream of COP CARS speeding toward the site of the
disturbance.  One vehicle is moving in the opposite direction,
against traffic -- a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN.

EXT. GLOBE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - A MOMENT LATER

BATMAN touches down on the roof and stares in horror at the
CORPSES strewn across the helipad.  A dying GUARD raises a
shaky hand...

BATMAN crouches beside him.  A GURGLE comes up from his throat
and a bubble of BLOOD swells on his lips.  All at once he
hears a WOMAN'S VOICE from the shadows of the GLOBE
SCULPTURE...

CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Some people just can't take discipline.
(beat)
Go ahead.  Finish 'em off...

His head jerks up.  He can't see anything.  A sudden WHOOSHING
noise, and now the voice is coming from the other side of the
roof.

CATWOMAN (O.S.)
You might as well.  You're going to get
blamed for it anyway.

He stands.  He gets a quick glimpse of a FELINE SHADOW
springing past a skylight; she's jumping all around the roof,
clinging to exposed pipes and fixtures.  He reaches for a
Batarang.

CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Oh, come on, angel.  You know you want to.
(purring loudly)
Besides -- I want to see how you do it!

BATMAN
Who are you?

He's barely gotten it out when she SLAMS INTO HIM from behind,
feet first, knocking him to the rooftop.  He tries to get up,
but she comes at him with a couple of CARTWHEELING KICKS,
knocking him back into a cornice.  He ducks right just as a
SHARP SPIKED HEEL strikes the exposed brick a mere three
inches from his throat.

He catches her leg, upends her -- but she somersaults away and
lands on her feet.  Cats always do...

CATWOMAN
My, aren't we frisky tonight.

He flings the BATARANG.  It CLANGS into the big NEON SIGN as
she SPRINGS up into the darkness, out of reach.  GLASS TUBING
shatters and SPARKS FLY as she calls down from the shadows --

CATWOMAN
I should tell you -- I've got nine lives
to play with -- and you've only got one...

He turns -- she drops DIRECTLY ONTO HIM -- and locked in a
death grip, they STAGGER BACKWARDS across the roof, directly
toward the HELICOPTER.  The huge ROTOR BLADES are still
turning...

BATMAN ducks instinctively and the CATWOMAN breaks free --
FALLING BACKWARD onto the roof.  It's a strategic move: when
he rushes at her, she BRACES HERSELF against the ground and
KICKS UPWARD with startling force.

This time the spiked heel connects -- LIFTING BATMAN off his
feet, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD into the TAIL of the HELICOPTER.
He slumps there, stunned -- and before he knows it, she's on
him.

She grabs his THROAT with one hand and clamps the other around
his CROTCH.  He tries to break her grip, but she's just as
strong as he is.  And she's LIFTING him -- forcing him upward,
toward the REAR STABILIZING ROTOR on the tail of the
helicopter!

The rear ROTOR BLADES WHINE LIKE A BUZZSAW as his head rises
perilously closer.  At the last possible instant, he grabs a
handful of her HAIR -- YANKS IT as hard as he can --

With a YOWL, she releases him.  They tumble to the roof and
she DIVES ATOP HIM.  Her TALONS click into place -- he sees
them poised directly above his EYES --

-- but manages to slam an ELBOW under her chin before she can
strike.  Now they're disentangled; they get up groggily and
circle each other...

SOMEONE IS BANGING on the metal door that leads up to the
roof, trying to break it down.  BATMAN turns for an instant --
a sudden CRACK --

-- and he finds himself all wrapped up in the CATWOMAN's CAT-
O'-NINE-TAILS...which is also outfitted with a TASER.  She
sends a PARALYZING ELECTRIC CHARGE through his body and he
collapses to the roof in a jittering heap.  The BANGING on the
door is louder...

CATWOMAN
Did I tell you I invited company?  -- Keep
'em busy, angel, I've gotta scat.

She kneels down and plants a BIG WET KISS on his twitching
face.  Then she scurries to the edge of the roof,
DISAPPEARING --

-- just as the DOOR gives way -- and an ARMED SWAT TEAM comes
crashing out onto the roof!

Just coming around, BATMAN tries to roll out of sight -- but
the COPS are swarming the place.  They spot the BODIES on the
tar and gravel, see BATMAN scuttling for cover, and draw the
obvious conclusion.  Pulling guns, they OPEN FIRE.  BULLETS
RICOCHET off the big metal GLOBE.

BATMAN, as is customary in these situations, shoots a
GRAPPLING HOOK at the roof of the next building over -- which
is a couple of stories taller than the Globe -- and REELS
HIMSELF UPWARD along the side wall.  The SWAT COPS score a
couple of dead hits which set him swinging like a pendulum,
but his body armor holds and he clings to the line long enough
to reach the roof.

CUT TO:

INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

FRlCK and FRACK, still in their Order-of-the-Bat garb, are in
the front seats; the PENGUIN is leaning out the side door.
Someone's obviously tipped the COPS about the source of all
the ruckus --

-- because a pair of POLICE CARS are on their tail and gaining
fast.  Still hanging in the doorway, the PENGUIN raises his
UMBRELLA, peers down its length like a RIFLE SIGHT, and PULLS
A TRIGGER.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

A SONIC DART -- one of the PENGUIN'S BIRD MAGNETS -- lodges
itself in the GRILLE of the foremost POLICE CAR.

INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

The COPS in the car react in astonishment as PIGEONS begin
HURLING THEMSELVES at the WINDSHIELDS.  A DOZEN KAMIKAZE BIRDS
bounce off in rapid succession.  CRACKS begin to spread across
the glass.

The COPS can't see where they're driving.  The car SWERVES
WILDLY.  And still the PIGEONS KEEP COMING -- COVERING THE
WINDSHIELD -- TOTALLY OBSCURING THE STREETS FROM VIEW...

EXT. STREETS - ON SQUAD CARS - THAT MOMENT

The first car, COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BIRDS, smacks into a
LAMPPOST and SKIDS.  The second car CRASHES INTO IT.  And the
pigeons continue to pour down from the heavens, SWARMING onto
the immobilized squad cars.

INT. NEWSPAPER VAN - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

The PENGUIN grins with delight as the van speeds off
unmolested.

PENGUIN
Look at that, boys -- they do flock
together!!

CUT TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

AMBULANCES are pouring into the square as the BAT ATTACK
continues.  COPS are firing their guns blindly into the skies
as they try to evacuate the citizenry.  PARAMEDICS drop the
stretcher they're carrying when BATS swoop down at their
heads...

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

BATMAN is still pursuing the CATWOMAN, who's perched one roof
over, in a squat, wiggling a finger for him to follow.  The
roofs are icy and treacherous, but he matches her step for
step, leap for leap, as she vaults from one building to the
next, leading him on.  Finally she reaches the edge of a
building on the corner of the block; there's no place to go
but down.  She squats on the ledge and smiles, beckoning to
him --

CATWOMAN
Ooh.  Where have you been all my life?

He edges closer.  Suddenly, she does a BACKFLIP -- DIRECTLY
OFF THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.

BATMAN hears GLASS SHATTERING.  He hesitates a second -- moves
closer to the edge of the roof -- PEERS OVER THE ICY CORNICE.

BATMAN'S POV - THAT MOMENT

Staring down, he sees a narrow LEDGE running around the facade
of the building some ten or twelve feet below.  The window of
a corner apartment has been smashed; the curtains are flapping
in the chill wind.

EXT. ROOF - ON BATMAN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

She's obviously making her getaway through the apartment.
BATMAN climbs up on the slippery cornice and prepares to drop
to the ledge below -- cautiously, because it's a long way
down.  A sudden CRACK --

The CATWOMAN hasn't entered the apartment.  Instead, she's
followed the ledge around the corner of the building, silently
doubling back onto the roof behind BATMAN.  He TURNS just as
her WHIP wraps itself around his left leg.  She gives it a
sharp tug -- his feet SKID on the ice -- and HE TOPPLES OVER
THE EDGE OF THE ROOF.

EXT. FACADE OF BUILDING - ON BATMAN

He plunges downward for the briefest of seconds -- then JERKS
UP SHORT, SLAMMING INTO THE WALL OF THE BUILDING.  The WHIP
has coiled itself around his leg, and for now it's holding
tight.  He's dangling upside down, bat-like; he bounces away
from the wall; he SPINS in midair as one loop of the whip
UNRAVELS, dropping him another foot or so.

He manages to brace his left foot against the wall.  It's a
massive strain, but he's momentarily safe if he can keep from
moving.  The alternative is a twelve-story drop, straight down
to the pavement...

EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN - THAT MOMENT

She's wrapped the handle-end of the whip around an exposed
pipe on the roof, anchoring BATMAN in place.  With a cheshire-
cat grin, she removes the RAVEN from her knapsack and holds it
on the edge of the cornice.

EXT. FACADE - THAT MOMENT

BATMAN hanging immobile.  Craning his neck, he can just see
the

RAVEN STATUETTE on the ledge above him -- bouncing slightly,
and apparently talking to him...

CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Nevermore.  Nevermore!

Now the CATWOMAN appears beside it -- elbows on the cornice,
chin propped up on her folded hands, like a chatty girl at a
fern bar.

CATWOMAN
Cute, huh!  I think it'll look nice over
the fireplace.  Maybe you can drop by and
see it sometime.
(demurely)
I hope you won't think I'm too...
aggressive or anything, but I find you
very attractive.

She toys aimlessly with the whipcord, batting at it like a cat
with a piece of yarn.  BATMAN grimaces.  She speaks in a low,
soothing, seductive tone -- almost a purr.  Behind the bondage
mask she bats her eyelashes.

CATWOMAN (cont.)
It's just so hard to meet interesting men
these days.  Don't you think so?
(sighing)
I have trouble with relationships.  Men
find me intimidating...kind of predatory,
you know?  Really I'm not.  Really I'm
just playful...

BATMAN huffs and puffs, trying to bend at the waist so he can
grab hold of the whip.  She frowns and YANKS on it.  His foot
flies free of the wall, and another loop of the whip uncoils
before he can stabilize himself.

CATWOMAN (cont.)
Don't laugh!  I'm trying to open up to
you!

Angrily, she holds a STEEL CLAW to the whip -- ready to cut
him loose.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

He's palmed the GRAPPLING-HOOK LAUNCHER from his belt.
Holding it close to his body, out of view, he works it around
into firing position.  He'll shoot it right through her if he
has to...

CATWOMAN (cont.)
I always seem to fall for the wrong guys.
You know...most men are rats.

ANGLE ON CATWOMAN

She withdraws her hand from the whip, reverts to her
philosphical mode.

CATWOMAN
Mice, really.  It's disgusting -- they beg
you to walk all over them and then they
whine when you do it.  Once you've had
your fun there's not much you can do but
kill them.
(beat)
But you seem different.  I mean, you
obviously understand about dressing up...
that saves a lot of explaining.  I think
people should indulge their fantasies,
don't you?

BATMAN is sweating profusely.  He can't hold his position much
longer.  And the CATWOMAN is dragging this insane flirtation
out endlessly...

CATWOMAN
So I think I'll let you live.  Cute boys
like you are hard to find...
(standing up)
'Bye, angel.  I'll be thinking about you.

And just like that, she VANISHES -- moving silently off with
her raven, leaving BATMAN to dangle.  He hangs there a moment,
tries to twist himself around without moving his foot.  He
braces one hand against the wall; with the other, he lifts his
grappling gun and FIRES.

The HOOK SNAGS somewhere on the roof.  BATMAN yanks the line
taut and is laboriously trying to pull himself erect when --

-- the CATWOMAN reappears over the edge of the cornice!

CATWOMAN
Gee...I'm so fickle.

A QUICK SWIPE of her STEEL TALONS, and the whipcord is neatly
SEVERED.  BATMAN'S FOOT slips out from under him -- but he's
still got hold of the GRAPPLING GUN.  He DROPS eight or ten
feet...

EXT. ROOF - ON CATWOMAN

watching with amusement as BATMAN's weight causes the hook to
DISLODGE.  It skitters across the gravel surface of the roof
and CATCHES, at the last instant, on the edge of the
CORNICE --

-- which promptly CRUMBLES and GIVES WAY.  Fascinated, the
CATWOMAN leans over the edge of the roof and peers down...

ANGLE ON BATMAN - AS HE FALLS

He flails wildly, tangled in his cape, as the ground rushes up
toward him.  He gets a last-ditch inspiration -- finds the GAS
CYLINDER on his belt and hits the switch.  The rods in his
cape begin to INFLATE...

Six stories up, his BATWINGS spring erect, slowing his plunge.
Five stories up, an UPDRAFT hits him and he suddenly INVERTS.
Four stories up, he rights himself.  Three stories up, he goes
into a downward spiral, out of control, gliding in great wide
arcs over the street...

...and a moment later there are no stories left.  With an ugly
crunch, he smacks into the slush-covered pavement and BOUNCES.
Face down, he skids some twenty feet to a halt -- right in the
middle of a BUSY INTERSECTION.

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A DELIVERY TRUCK hits the brakes and screeches to a stop, two
feet away from BATMAN'S HEAD.  He doesn't move.  PEDESTRIANS
are already gawking and pointing as the DRIVER climbs out and
peers down at the inert caped figure lying face-down in the
street:

DRIVER
What the hell is this?

CARS are backed up, due to the panic in Gotham Square a few
blocks over.  HORNS are honking.  A TRAFFIC COP marches
over --

TRAFFIC COP
Awright, what's the problem here?
(spotting BATMAN)
Jesus.

He tries to clear the crowd away.  A full-fledged GRIDLOCK is
forming around the prostrate BATMAN.  The COP blows his
whistle, tries to maintain order as two unifonned PATROLMEN
rush up to join him.

They manage to roll the unconscious BATMAN over on his back.
The assembled COPS stare down at the mask, the scuffed body
armor.  Still waxy, they finger the GUNS in their holsters...

PATROLMAN
Good God.  Cowan -- get to the car --
radio the commissioner!!

By now there must be two hundred people in the intersection,
all surging forward to get a look.  More COPS are arriving to
beat them back.

TRAFFIC COP
Is he dead?  What do we do?

PATROLMAN
The mask.  Get the mask off.

They hunker down over BATMAN.  One of them tugs at his mask --
but the helmet-like cowl doesn't want to give way.  He feels
around --

TRAFFIC COP
Some kinda seam here on the neck...

The PATROLMAN nods okay, and the COP tugs at a Velcro-like
fastening under BATMAN's chin.  The instant it comes open --

-- a BURST of FINE GREEN MIST spews forth from concealed JETS
in the gold-and-black BAT-EMBLEM, and the COPS reel backward,
shrieking, gasping for breath and clewing at their eyes.
Booby-trap -- they've just been Maced.

One of the ONLOOKING COPS steps back in horror and confusion.
On impulse, he draws his gun and FIRES TWICE at BATMAN.  The
body JERKS and the bullets RICOCHET OFF --

TRAFFIC COP
DON'T SHOOT, you idiot.  The crowd --

Before he can finish, a BLACK BOOT kicks the gun out of the
ONLOOKING COP's hand.  BATMAN is back among the living.
SIRENS BLARE as he spins and rolls into a crouch -- lashing
out with elbows and knees -- driving the cops back --

Fuck the crowd.  TWO MORE COPS pull their guns and open fire
in absolute panic.  BATMAN slams backward into the delivery
truck and crumples to the ground.  As he falls, he grabs a
couple of SMOKE CAPSULES from his belt and flings them to the
pavement.

Seconds later, a THICK CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE is spreading
through the intersection.  BATMAN emerges into the midst of
the crowd -- weaving in and out among the stalled vehicles --

EXT. INTERSECTION - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

A MOUNTED COP rides up to the outer fringe of the traffic jam,
drawn by all the confusion.  He rears the horse back, turns it
in a circle; blows his piercing whistle as he tries to reroute
the incoming cars...

Suddenly a WIRE wraps itself around his chest and arms.  He
looks down.  He sees a BATARANG in the instant before a sudden
JERK pulls him cleanly off his mount.

BATMAN climbs up on the hood of the nearest car -- vaults over
to the next -- and the next -- then hops into the saddle of
the MOUNTED COP's waiting HORSE.  He digs in his heels,
maneuvering through traffic...

EXT. POLICE CAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

LT. EDDIE BULLOCK and another plainclothesman are a few blocks
off trying to get through the jam.  Their siren is on, but the
cars blocking their path have no room to pull over.  BULLOCK
grabs the radio mike:

BULLOCK
Hell of a mess up here, Commissioner.
We'll have to go in on foot...

As they wait for a response, they see a HORSE charging past in
the opposite direction.  On the back of the horse...is BATMAN.

Gaping, BULLOCK nudges his partner -- who throws the car
immediately into REVERSE.  As they watch, BATMAN kicks the
horse's flanks and turns right -- toward Gotham Park.

INT. GOTHAM PARK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

Two RED BERETS, members of the Order of the Bat, are on night
patrol, strolling down a rambling path near the entrance to
the park.

RED BERET I
This is wack, man.  Nothing ever happens
around here anymore.

The other RED BERET lets out a WHOOP OF FEAR and yanks his
partner out of the way.  They tumble into a snowdrift as
BATMAN'S HORSE vaults over the stone wall of the park and
gallops past, nearly trampling them in the process.  By now,
SQUAD CARS are roaring into the park...

INT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER

SIRENS BLARE and RED LIGHTS FLASH in the distance as the COP
CARS spread out along the winding roads that run through the
park.  BATMAN reins the horse in suddenly as a black-and-white
whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than
twenty yards away.

He turns the horse in a circle.  MORE RED LIGHTS appear in the
distance; another contingent of SQUAD CARS has just entered
from the opposite side of the park.  It's going to be tough
getting out of here...

Then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great-grandfather,
GENERAL WAYNE -- two Waynes on horseback, not twenty feet
apart.  He thinks back to his earlier conversation with VICKI
and gets an inspiration.

He rides past General Wayne to the STONE BRIDGE which spans
the little frozen creek.  There he finds the DRAINAGE TUNNEL
VICKI described, obscured by the wire-mesh grate.  This must
be where the boy vigilante holes up...

He dismounts, ties his CAPE to the pommel of the horse's
saddle and sends it off with a slap.  He pries the grate loose
and crawls inside.

INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

A dank, but cozy, hideout; WARM STEAM hisses from a grate in
the floor.

RUMBLING SOUNDS fill the little chamber as a SUBWAY TRAIN
passes directly underneath.  A little farther back there's an
ACCESS SHAFT, with a Jacob's ladder, leading to the train
tracks below.

Poking around, he finds a couple of cardboard BOXES -- the boy
vigilante's stash.  The first contains tins of food, plus
various odds and ends.  The second's more in line with what he
needs -- it's full of OLD CLOTHING.

A TRAIN rumbles past underneath.  BRUCE removes his COWL and
sets about putting together a civilian disguise that'll get
him out of the park.  A wool hat and a long, moth-eaten
topcoat: perfect.  As he's pulling them out of the box, he
spies something extremely odd --

It's a COSTUME -- a spangled red-and-green GYMNASTS OUTFIT
with a little yellow CAPE -- neatly folded and in pristine
condition.  He removes it carefully from the box and holds it
up in front of him.  Stitched on the vest is a single initial,
""R,"" in a black circle.  He stares at the whole mystifying
ensemble in complete befuddlement...

The roar of the train subsides, and he hears a SCUFFLING
NOISE.  Someone's in the tunnel with him.  He lowers the
costume abruptly --

-- revealing DICK, the boy vigilante, who's crouched in front
of him not three feet away.  The kid's just crawled up through
the ACCESS SHAFT, and he's not at all happy to see an intruder
messing with his stuff:

DICK
It's MINE!

He lunges furiously at BRUCE.  The two of them tumble back
into the grate at the tunnel entrance, KNOCKING IT LOOSE --

EXT. PARK - MOUTH OF TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A POLICE CAR streaks past on the bridge overhead mere seconds
before BRUCE and DICK roll out into the snow, still grappling.
BRUCE flings the kid into the bridge abutment.  DICK lands
hard; when he looks up, his EYES WIDEN, and a weird crooked
smile comes to his face...

Out here in the moonlight he can see his opponent.  The body
armor -- the gold-and-black emblem on the breastplate -- and
above it all, the face of BRUCE WAYNE, exposed to view...

As a siren howls nearby, BRUCE flattens himself against the
bridge.  Like it or not, his fate rests entirely in a strange
little boy's hands.

The kid sizes up the situation immediately.  He nods his head
up and down.  Then he takes off his own ratty coat and throws
it to BRUCE.

BRUCE is in no position to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He
pulls on the coat, gives DICK a nod of acknowledgement, and
starts to move off.

DICK
NO.  WAIT!

BRUCE turns, uncertainly.  DICK throws him his woolen SKI CAP.

The KID GIGGLES -- oddly, uncontrollably.  Then he sprints off
into the woods, dancing, leaping.  As he disappears from view,
he lets out a shrill, piercing, almost FERAL SHRIEK --

-- which is obviously intended to divert the cops.  BRUCE
makes haste in the opposite direction.

EXT. PARK - ANOTHER SECTION - A MOMENT LATER

BRUCE'S HORSE gallops through the trees, the black bat-cape
still attached to its saddle and BILLOWING behind it.

INT. SQUAD CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TWO COPS scanning the park.  The CAPED HORSE charges past in
front of them and is momentarily silhouetted in the
headlights.  From a distance, it looks like BATMAN is still in
the saddle.

The COP at the wheel makes a sudden turn.  A moment later, he
SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

A MAN has just stepped out onto the road, directly in the
squad car's path -- a hunched figure in an old coat and woolen
ski cap, obviously one of the homeless.  A COP leans on the
horn and shouts out the window:

COP
Dumb son of a bitch!!

The MAN -- BRUCE -- steps back out of the squad car's path.
The COPS take off -- in hot pursuit of a riderless horse.

CUT TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - PRE-DAWN

A DOCTOR'S BAG rests on the kitchen table.  ALFRED, in robe
and slippers, rummages inside it and comes up with an ACE
BANDAGE.

ALFRED
Commissioner Gordon called.  He wants to
install a full contingent of police guards
here at the manor -- in round-the-clock
shifts -- to protect you from Batman.

BRUCE is sitting erect in a straightbacked chair.  His shirt
is open and he's holding his arms aloft while ALFRED wraps a
full roll of adhesive tape around his battered RIBS.

BRUCE
Great.  What'd you tell him?

ALFRED
I told him that since you were Batman,
you'd require no protection from Batman.

BRUCE makes a face: how droll.  ALFRED tears off the tape with
a brisk YANK -- and BRUCE lets out an involuntary YELP OF
PAIN.

BRUCE
Jesus, Alfred -- !!

ALFRED
In future, sir...I strongly advise against
trying to fly off twenty-story buildings.

BRUCE
It's just a few bruises.

ALFRED
One bruise, sir.  Which covers your entire
body.

BRUCE gets up -- stiffly -- and buttons his shirt in gingerly
fashion while ALFRED packs his first-aid gear in the doctor's
bag.

BRUCE
I'm getting too old for this line of work.
(beat)
Cops placed me at the scene of the crime
-- that weird kid of Vicki's saw my
face --

ALFRED
I shouldn't worry overmuch.  I doubt the
two of you move in the same circles.

BRUCE
-- and I got the living shit knocked out
of me by a woman.

ALFRED
Sir -- such outmoded sexist attitudes are
quite unbecoming.

INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY

In a lavishly-appointed guest room on Gotham's Upper East Side
(or equivalent thereof), we find a pair of PLAINCLOTHES COPS
settled in for a stakeout: rumpled topcoats thrown across
antique chairs, french-fry bags and GREASY BURGER WRAPPINGS
littering the carpet.  HIGH-POWERED RIFLES propped against one
wall.

They peer through venetian blinds at an ELEGANT OLD BROWNSTONE
across the street...

HIS POV - ROOF OF BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT

A UNIFORMED COP, also carrying a walkie-talkie, is keeping
watch on the roof of the brownstone.  He signals ""all clear""
to his counterpart watching from the house opposite.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - THAT MOMENT

TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN are parked at the end of the block,
munching on donuts and watching the same brownstone.  They
spot a POSTMAN lugging his sack up the tree-lined street on
his way to the brownstone.  One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN picks
up his RADIO MIKE:

PLAINCLOTHESMAN
Mailman's coming.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - A MINUTE LATER

The POSTMAN marches up the front steps of the brownstone,
sorting through letters and packages.  He hasn't even rung the
bell when the door is opened by ANOTHER COP -- who snatches
the mail delivery from his hands and SLAMS THE DOOR IN HIS
FACE.

INT. BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT

MORE COPS, at least half a dozen, are milling about inside --
unshaven, ties loosened, shirtsleeves rolled up.  They're in
for the long haul.

The first COP gives a handful of letters to a couple of
COLLEAGUES -- then hands over a PARCEL, wrapped in brown
paper, to a pair of BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERTS.  They carry it
gingerly into the kitchen.  Into the midst of all this
bustling activity strides COMMISSIONER GORDON:

GORDON
Anything suspicious!

In the parlor, where all the shades are drawn, TWO COPS are
examining each letter in turn, holding them up to a light
bulb, CREASING THEM carefully before slitting them open.

COP
Nothing yet.  Christmas cards and bills.

He anxiously watches their progress.  A VOICE calls from the
kitchen.

BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT (V.O.)
Commissioner -- ?

INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

GORDON enters.  The bomb-disposal boys have their equipment
scattered all over the kitchen table.  They've slit the brown-
paper wrapping of the PACKAGE, exposing a ROUND DECORATIVE
TIN.

BOMB-DISPOSAL EXPERT
It's a fruitcake.

He lifts the lid for GORDON to have a look.

GORDON
...Have it analyzed.

INT. BROWNSTONE - ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

A bleary-eyed ELLIOTT TIPTREE marches down the stairs carrying
a pair of OVERSIZED SUITCASES.  His WIFE and TWO KIDS are
behind him -- all bundled up, preparing to embark on an
extended vacation.

POLICEMAN
Mrs. Tiptree?  The car's here.

TIPTREE, fighting back tears, embraces his wife for a long
wordless moment.  Their LITTLE GIRL, aged six, tugs at Mommy's
sleeve.

LITTLE GIRL
I don't wanna go to Grandma's.  I wanna
stay here with Daddy.

MRS. TIPTREE
She's got a nice tree just like ours,
honey.  Daddy'll be up as soon as he can.

LITTLE GIRL
She's old.  She doesn't even have cable.

LITTLE BOY
What about our presents?

He gestures toward the GIFTS piled high around the tree in the
parlor.

TIPTREE
Don't worry.  I'll bring 'em up with me.
We'll open 'em when I get there.

TIPTREE forces a smile for the kids.  He CLUTCHES his wife's
hand.

GORDON
Sorry, folks, but we'd better move along.

MRS. TIPTREE
Kids?  Tell your Daddy goodbye...

Tearful hugs all around; then a cadre of UNIFORMED COPS escort
MRS. TIPTREE and the KIDS to the door.  TIPTREE pulls GORDON
aside.

TIPTREE
They'll be safe, won't they?

GORDON
As safe as we can make 'em.
(beat; sternly)
It would help if you could give us some
small hint what this is all about.

TIPTREE
I told you.  I...

TIPTREE shrugs helplessly and stares at his shoes.  GORDON is
convinced he's holding something back.

GORDON
You have no idea what was in that box that
Provost had delivered from the bank.

TIPTREE shakes his head wearily.  GORDON glowers as he turns
to go.

GORDON (cont.)
All right, Mr. Tiptree.  Merry Christmas.

GORDON exits.  TIPTREE wanders listlessly into the living
room, pulls back the drapes, and WATCHES as his wife and kids
ride off in a convoy of POLICE CARS.  One of the COPS tries to
pull him away from the window, but he refuses to move...

...until a PHONE RINGS.  Everyone jumps at once.  A TECHNICIAN
hits a switch on a loudspeaker-and-tape-recorder assembly,
then gestures for TIPTREE to pick up the receiver...

TIPTREE
Hello...?

VOICE ON LOUDSPEAKER
Mr. Tiptree?  Andy here.  Listen -- we've
got a chance to grab a good-sized block of
Atlantic Teledyne at twenty-six and an
eighth --

The COPS heave sighs and turn off their tracing equipment.

TIPTREE
Not today, Andy.  Let's talk after New
Year's.

TIPTREE hangs up and starts to BAWL right there in the middle
of the room.  The COPS turn away in sympathetic embarrassment
as he goes to a corner wet bar and pours himself a good stiff
jolt.

INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Wallowing in despair, TIPTREE sits at an antique secretary
composing a LETTER.  He takes a long pull on a glass of
Scotch, signs his name, and inserts the letter into an
envelope.  He opens the desk drawer -- takes a long look at a
.38 automatic stashed inside -- then finds a stamp and affixes
it to the envelope.  He addresses it to BRUCE WAYNE.

A moment later he hears a noise at the window: TINK TINK TINK.
He peers through the blinds and sees a CARRIER PIGEON on the
ledge outside -- pecking at the glass, asking to come in.

He raises the window and the PIGEON hops fearlessly inside,
onto the sill.  The bird, well-trained, struggles only
slightly as he unties a tiny CAPSULE from its leg and removes
a FOLDED NOTE.  Scrawled across it is a handwritten message:

IF POLICE SEE THIS YOUR FAMILY IS DEAD

He opens the note and begins to read as the PIGEON takes wing.

CUT TO:

INT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - DAY

BRUCE is at his desk examining the morning editions.  A BANNER
HEAD-LINE shrieks:

BATMAN SOUGHT IN PUBLISHER'S MURDER
Bat Attack Panics Gotham Square
J. Harrison Provost, 41, Leaves Distinguished Legacy

He hears a VISITOR arriving in the entry hall.  He gets up...

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT - DAY

BRUCE ambles out and sees SELINA, who's just arrived, doing
her patetented thing on ALFRED.

SELINA
English accents are so stimulating.
(beat)
You have the most beautiful silver hair!

ALFRED stammers as she reaches up to STROKE HIS HAIR.  He's
about to break into a sweat.  He's eminently relieved when she
turns and sees --

SELINA (cont.)
Bruce!

BRUCE
Selina.  What are you doing here?

ALFRED affects a look of grandmotherly outrage as SELINA
slinks over and takes BRUCE by the arm.  She's on him like a
barnacle.

SELINA
I wanted to see your things, remember?
And I got tired of waiting for you to call
me back.
(gesturing toward ALFRED)
He's adorable.  How long have you had him?

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY

BRUCE leads SELINA down a hallway to the armory.  He glances
back over his shoulder and sees ALFRED peering snoopily around
the corner.

BRUCE
You heard about Harry Provost.

SELINA
It's incredibly awful.  It got me a little
worried.
(sidling up closer)
I hate to think of something happening to
you.

BRUCE
Same here.

SELINA
It's odd, though.  Danger, the thought of
suddenly dying -- in a weird way it gets
you sort of...aroused.  Don't you think?

BRUCE cocks an eyebrow at her.  Everything gets her sort of
aroused.

INT. ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER

SELINA BEAMS at the fantastic collection of armored gear and
exotic weapons.  She's like a kid in a toy shop.

SELINA
Bruce, this is incredible.
(indicating a suit of armor)
Malaysian -- ?

BRUCE
Not bad.  Sarawak warrior caste.

SELINA
It's like -- everything in here is another
little piece of your mind.  I was right
about you.
(turning to face him)
Promise, okay?  Promise you'll show me
every inch of this place.



PAGE 87 MISSING FROM HARD COPY



INT. BATCAVE - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

ALFRED is at a PRINTER, scanning page after page of computer
printout.  He delivers his findings to BRUCE, who's seated at
a nearby terminal, scanning data and tapping away at the
keyboard.

ALFRED
The police have no files whatsoever on
Selina Kyle.

BRUCE
(abstractedly)
London...Cairo...Belgium...

ALFRED
What exactly are you --

BRUCE
Her credit card records.
(looking up)
Every major art theft in the last five
years -- she's been on the scene or close
to it.

ALFRED
You mean she's some sort of -- collector?
A...cat burglar, or --

BRUCE
Could be.  Museum curator, authenticator
-- she's got the perfect cover for it.
(beat)
What would she want with that stupid
raven?

ALFRED
Raven, sir?

BRUCE
That's what the Catwoman took from
Provost.  A little raven statuette, about
so big...
(shaking his head)
But it couldn't have been that valuable.

He continues to scan the screen.  ALFRED is suddenly lost in
thought.

ALFRED
How very odd.
(long pause)
I'm sure it's nothing, but --

BRUCE
What, Alfred?

ALFRED
Your father had a raven, sir.  A small
statue of the very sort you describe.  It
used to sit on his desk.

This piques BRUCE's interest.  He swivels around in his chair
and stares directly up at ALFRED.

BRUCE
What happened to it?

ALFRED
After your father's...demise, Mr. Tiptree
came to the house and asked if he could
have it.  As a keepsake.  I saw no harm...
(shrugging)
That was thirty years ago.

BRUCE
Wait a minute.  Mr. Tiptree?

ALFRED
George Tiptree.  Your friend Elliott's
father.

CUT TO:

INT. TIPTREE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

TIPTREE has an oversized suitcase open on the bed.  It's empty
-- except for the BALLED-UP WADS of NEWSPAPER which he's
stuffing inside it.  His head turns suddenly at the sound of
the doorbell...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

TIPTREE emerges from his bedroom and peers over a bannister
into the ENTRYWAY below.  Standing there is an unexpected
visitor -- BRUCE WAYNE -- holding his arms aloft while a
battery of COPS pat him down.

BRUCE
What are you looking for -- Batarangs?

TIPTREE
Bruce!  Come on up.
(to the COPS)
I want to talk to Mr. Wayne alone.

The COPS look on suspiciously as BRUCE ascends the stairs.

INT. TIPTREE'S LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

TIPTREE lets BRUCE inside and shuts the door behind him.
BRUCE hands him a GIFT BOX.

BRUCE
I brought you a Christmas present.  Sorry
about the wrapping -- the police made me
open it.

TIPTREE opens the box and pulls out a diamond-studded TIE
CLASP.  He looks up at BRUCE with an odd mixture of
bewilderment and gratitude.  BRUCE nods for him to try it on,
and he obliges...

TIPTREE
...I'm afraid I don't have anything for
you.

BRUCE
I think you may have something that
belonged to my father.

TIPTREE
-- You know?

He stares at BRUCE, astonished.  His head sinks into his
hands.

TIPTREE (cont.)
It'll all be over tomorrow.  One way or
another, it'll all be over.
(looking up; despondent)
I've decided, Bruce.  I'm gonna give him
the last two ravens.  He's already got the
others.

BRUCE
What are you talking about?  Who?

TIPTREE
Batman.  I don't know how he found out,
but --

TIPTREE reaches for the bottle on his desk to pour himself a
drink, but BRUCE angrily knocks the glass out of his hands.

BRUCE
It's time you told me what's going on
here.

TIPTREE
Didn't you ever wonder where it came from,
Bruce?  All the privilege, all the power
...all the money?
(beat)
The ravens are a...a kind of map, Bruce.
The key to an incredibly vast fortune.

BRUCE
Whose fortune?

TIPTREE
Gotham City's.

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

The cobblestone streets of 19th-Century Gotham.  A massive
EXPLOSION blows open one wall of a municipal building, and
total CHAOS erupts: fires starting, BYSTANDERS screaming,
POLICE rushing to the scene...

TIPTREE
In 1880 the Gotham City Treasury was
looted.  It was a fantastic operation --
perfect military precision.  The robbers
made off with milllons in gold and silver
bullion...

A HORSE-DRAWN CART weighted down with gold bricks careens
around a corner.  Atop it are two men in MASKS, firing a
GATLING GUN into the crowd.  POLICE and ONLOOKERS tumble to
the pavement, shot dead, as ANOTHER CART emerges from the
wreckage of the treasury and takes off in the opposite
direction.

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

CITY OFFICIALS in a boardroom trading papers back and forth,
arguing furiously with five calm, distinguished-looking GENTS
-- one of whom is the bushy-bearded Civil War hero GEN. OLIVER
WAYNE.

TIPTREE (V.O.)
The city was going under.  Bankrupt...
until five rich men stepped in to bail it
out.  In exchange they took the land
rights, the mineral rights, the service
contracts --

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE

BRUCE
The Five Families.

TIPTREE
Our ancestors.  They bought Gotham City --
carved it up and ran it into the ground.
In five years they were rich beyond
imagining.
(pause)
We've just been following in their
footsteps.  And in all this time no one's
ever suspected --

BRUCE
-- that they were the ones behind the
robbery?

FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE (MOS)

The FIVE PATRIARCHS in front of a roaring fireplace at Wayne
Manor, raising a celebratory toast.  CAMERA PANS OVER to a
nearby table; on it rest FIVE RAVEN STATUETTES.

TIPTREE (O.S.)
They had five ravens made.  Five ravens
which -- combined -- would reveal the
location of the treasure they'd stolen.
(beat)
But they never touched it.  They never
needed to.  It's still there to this day.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE AND TIPTREE

TIPTREE
The ravens, and the secret -- have been
passed down through generations.  Father
to son...
(shaking his head)
Your father -- died before he could tell
you.

BRUCE
So they stole his piece of the puzzle.

TIPTREE
Yeah.  I've got it, Bruce, and I'm going
to hand it over.  He's right, you know.
We've all been feeding -- feeding on the
soul of Gotham...

BRUCE stares at him, stony-faced.  There's one part of the
story that doesn't quite add up.

BRUCE (cont.)
I don't believe you, Elliott.  My father
was a decent man -- an honorable man.  He
would never have taken part in a scheme
like this.

TIPTREE
It wasn't his doing, Bruce.  It was --

BRUCE
That doesn't matter.  If he knew that his
fortune was based on a crime -- a crime
against the city...
(violently)
Reputation or not, he would've tried to --

TIPTREE
Christ, Bruce!  Do you want me to spell it
out for you?!?

BRUCE backs off.  An awful shiver of anticipation runs down
his spine.

TIPTREE (cont.)
He was a decent man.  He was an honorable
man.  That's why they had him killed.

CAMERA ZEROES IN ON BRUCE'S HORRIFIED FACE as we get a

SERIES OF SHOTS

Quick, almost subliminal glimpses of BRUCE's primal trauma: a
MUGGER snatching at his mother's necklace.  THOMAS WAYNE
lunging at him.  The young JACK NAPIER firing at THOMAS.
PEARLS showering down on the rain-drenched sidewalk.  A second
bullet felling his MOTHER --

-- and finally, young BRUCE himself, face wracked with PAIN
and GRIEF --

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

-- an expression which perfectly matches the one which the
adult BRUCE is wearing as he relives it all thirty years
later.  Staggered and glassy-eyed, he stares off into space as
TIPTREE finishes his tale.

TIPTREE
They killed him...to protect their secret
...and now the bill's come due.  Now the
bill's come due.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - TOWARD DUSK

The wrought-iron gate outside BRUCE's vast estate -- and
beyond it, Wayne Manor itself, rising bold and stately against
the setting sun.  A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past...

INT. WAYNE MANOR - BRUCE'S BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

BRUCE lies motionless on his bed.  Scattered about him are
SCRAPBOOKS, FAMILY PHOTOS and yellowed NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS
which describe the murder of his parents.  Disoriented, he
gazes about aimlessly at his familiar surroundings -- which no
longer seem quite so familiar...

He folds his arms formally across his chest and stares up at
the ceiling, inert, as if the very weight of his heritage is
crushing him down.  Somewhere, a PHONE RINGS.  He makes no
move to answer it.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - DUSK

VICKI's at the kitchen table drinking coffee.  ALFRED, who's
in his apron preparing dinner, picks up the ringing phone.

ALFRED
Thank you, yes, everything's fine.  I'll
expect your next call in an hour.
(hanging up; to VICKI)
The police are becoming an awful nuisance.

VICKI
I feel so awful for him, Alfred.  There
must be something we can do.

ALFRED
I realized long ago -- that there are
places in Mr. Wayne's heart which no one
will ever penetrate --  or share.
(pause)
He loves you, Miss Vale.  But in certain
ways he will always be alone.

BRUCE (O.S.)
...Thanks for the testimonial.

ALFRED turns and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway, staring
at him.  He starts to say something, but thinks better of it.
He returns to his dinner preparations as BRUCE sits down
across from VICKI.  She extends a hand and he takes it --
making a visible effort to hold himself together.

BRUCE
Tiptree's planning some kind of rendezvous
with 'Batman.'  I think Batman ought to be
there when it happens.

ALFRED
I see, sir.  When shall we expect you
back?

BRUCE
Get your cap.  You're driving.

INT. TIPTREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

It's late, and the house is dark as TIPTREE treeds silently
downstairs carrying an OVERSIZED SUITCASE.  The lights are on
in the kitchen, where the COPS are playing poker and watching
TV.

INT. PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTS twinkle in the darkness.  TIPTREE kneels
beside the tree and digs around among the packages.  He pulls
out an OBLONG GIFT BOX with a tag addressed ""TO DADDY -- FROM
SANTA.""

With a glance back at the kitchen, he soundlessly unwraps the
package -- and opens it to reveal a matched set of RAVEN
STATUETTES.  He transfers them to the big suitcase -- then
slinks into the hallway...

INT. BEDROOM ACROSS STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The two STAKEOUT COPS are chuckling at a Charlie Brown
Christmas special on a portable TV.  One of them glances out
the window and sees a man in a topcoat emerging from the
brownstone, SUITCASE in hand...

STAKEOUT COP I
Shit -- that's Tiptree!!

The COP grabs for his WALKIE-TALKIE.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIPTREE is halfway down the block when two COPS burst out of
the brownstone.

COP
Mr. Tiptree!  What the hell are you --

HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON as the SURVEILLANCE CAR revs its engine.
TIPTREE breaks into a RUN -- and the COPS from the brownstone
follow suit.  At the end of the block he vanishes down a
SUBWAY ENTRANCE.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - THAT MOMENT

A VIOLINIST is panhandling outside the token booth as the COPS
come racing down the stairs.  The COPS trip over his open
violin case, scattering small change across the conrete floor.
They flash their badges at the booth and VAULT OVER THE
TURNSTILE --

-- just in time to see TIPTREE, with his SUITCASE, scuttling
down a stairway which leads to the train platform below.

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - A MOMENT LATER

TIPTREE steps onto an EXPRESS TRAIN.  The doors slide shut
behind him -- and the hapless COPS curse under their breath as
he rolls off.

COP
We've gotta get back to the radio.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - A MOMENT LATER - MOVING

TIPTREE takes an open seat and looks around apprehensively.
Being fabulously rich, be's probably ridden the subway twice
in his life -- and at this time of night, EVERY FACE in the
sparsely-populated car looks vaguely menacing.  Derelicts,
prostitutes, teen-gang members -- ALL OF THEM eye this well-
heeled stranger with intense curiosity as he clutches his
suitcase and stares anxiously at the floor...

An ODD, GAUNT FIGURE enters at the end of the car.  It's a
DEAFMUTE.  He shambles down the aisle passing out little white
CARDS.  One side is a guide to International Sign Language.
The other reads:

DEAF AND DUMB
PLEASE HELP -- $1.00

TWO YOUNG TOUGHS take a card and tear it in half, chuckling,
shining the DEAFMUTE on.  A HOOKER, the heart-of-gold type,
stuffs a buck in his tin cup.  He reaches TIPTREE and extends
a card; TIPTREE ignores him, refusing to make eye contact --

-- but the DEAFMUTE shoves the card insistently into his face.
Now TIPTREE looks up.  THIS CARD bears a personalized message:

GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION
B-TRAIN WEST TO RIVERVIEW

TIPTREE's eyes widen.  The DEAFMUTE -- who is in fact FRICK --
glowers down and holds out his cup.  TIPTREE digs in his
pocket; the smallest bill he's got is a twenty, but he hands
it over anyway.

Smiling at this act of generosity, FRICK moves on to the next
car.  TIPTREE stares down tremulously at the card.  He fidgets
with his TIE CLASP -- the one BRUCE gave him earlier...

INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

TIGHT on a hand-held ELECTRONIC TRACING DEVICE.  A small BLIP
moves across a shifting GRID not unlike a radar screen.

BRUCE is in the back of the limo, eyeing the tracer intently.
ALFRED's up front, at the wheel.

BRUCE
According to this, he's directly below us.

ALFRED
The subway, sir?

BRUCE
Yeah.  Take a right.

INT. GOTHAM CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT

It's slightly more crowded here in the hub of Gotham.  TIPTREE
emerges onto the platform and spies a squad of TRANSIT COPS
thirty or forty feet away -- speaking into WALKIE-TALKIES as
they scan the crowd.

Sticking close to the tracks, he turns swiftly toward the
nearest stairway -- blending in with the crowd, trying to hold
the SUITCASE out of view.

INT. LOWER PLATFORM - A MINUTE LATER

TIPTREE IS RUNNING for the B-train just as the doors begin to
close.  He manages to thrust the suitcase inside -- but the
doors SLIDE SHUT on his hand, and he DROPS IT.  He stands
there on the platform, his face turning BONE WHITE as the
train lurches forward...

False alarm.  The train stops, and the doors hiss open again.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER

TIPTREE clambers aboard with a severe case of palpitations.
As the train pulls out, a couple of rough-looking but helpful
STREET TYPES show him to a seat and hand him his precious
suitcase.  He sits there panting...

Moments later, a DEAFMUTE enters the car.  TIPTREE does a
take: it's the exact same guy who was riding the other line!
Of course, he doesn't know about Frick's malignant twin --
FRACK...

WIPE TO:

INT. LOCAL STOP - TEN MINUTES LATER - NIGHT

Having changed trains twice more since we left him, TIPTREE
debarks at a deserted local stop.  The station is EMPTY except
for one other passenger, who's gotten off here as well -- a
WOMAN in a long fur coat.

TIPTREE WATCHES as she approaches on her way to the stairwell,
STILLETO HEELS clicking across the floor.  There's something
familiar about her -- but she's wearing a big, broad-brimmed
hat, and she TILTS IT DOWN as she passes, obscuring her face.
It is, of course, SELINA...

TIPTREE stands there expectantly with his suitcase, awaiting
further instructions.  They aren't long in coming.  A BLACK
MYNAH BIRD swoops out of the tunnel, lands on the platform,
and STRUTS in front of him.

MYNAH
FOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!  FOLLOW ME.

The bird flutters its wings and takes off again -- INTO THE
TUNNEL.  TIPTREE stares after it in disbelief.  Then the bird
CAWS AGAIN -- its shrill voice echoing from the darkness of
the tunnel:

MYNAH (O.S.)
FOLLOW ME.  AWWWKK!

TIPTREE clambers over the edge of the platform, dropping
awkwardly to the tracks below.  Suitcase in hand, he begins to
walk...

INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

ALFRED tearing up the streets as BRUCE consults his tracer.

BRUCE
He's slowed down.  Looks like he's under
the park.

ALFRED
How do you propose to get down there, sir?
We can't have Batman strolling up to buy a
token.

BRUCE
I know another way in.
(beat)
Step on it.  They're down there waiting
for him.

ALFRED turns the limo hard right -- into GOTHAM PARK -- past
the statue of GENERAL WAYNE atop his horse...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - THAT MOMENT

A LOCAL TRAIN roars by, filling the screen.  When it passes,
we see TIPTREE with his suitcase, walking along the express
tracks at the far wall of the tunnel -- more frightened with
each step.  It's dark and eerie down here in the tunnels; the
only illumination comes from dim LANTERNS spaced at fifty-foot
intervals.

He sees the lights of an EXPRESS TRAIN behind him, and quickly
switches to the local tracks.  The train rumbles past with a
deafening blare, and the car lights briefly illuminate his
surroundings.  TIPTREE glances over at the inside wall of the
tunnel...

...where he sees, huddled in an ALCOVE just off the tracks, a
small gathering of HOMELESS PEOPLE.  They've set up camp down
here in the tunnels, away from the elements.  Surrounded by
bags full of old clothes, DINING on canned food and cheap
wine, they stare curiously at the well-heeled stranger with
the suitcase who's invaded their domain.

TIPTREE eyes them fearfully and picks up his pace, hastening
down the tunnel.  The HOMELESS make no move to follow -- with
one exception.  A KID, thirteen or fourteen, in a ratty
topcoat, climbs down onto the tracks and watches inquisitively
as TIPTREE vanishes into the shadows.

His face is familiar.  It's DICK -- the boy vigilante from the
park.

INT. TUNNEL - FARTHER DOWN TRACKS - A MOMENT LATER

In this stretch of the tunnel the LANTERNS don't seem to be
working -- and the MYNAH is completely invisible.  When he
comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of
the bird's shrill voice to guide him:

MYNAH
AWWRRK!  FOLLOW ME.

TIPTREE stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness.  He trips on
the tracks and drops the suitcase.  As he's getting to his
feet, a FLASHLIGHT shines DIRECTLY IN HIS FACE...

VOICE
STOP THERE.

The MYNAH BIRD flutters through the beam of light and perches
on the shoulder of an UNSEEN FIGURE.  TIPTREE COWERS and
SQUINTS, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands
before him is shielding his face with an open UMBRELLA.

TIPTREE
I've cooperated.  I've done everything you
said.

PENGUIN
Open the case.

TIPTREE lifts the lid, revealirig TWO RAVENS in the suitcase.
A CACKLING LAUGH echoes in the darkness.

PENGUIN (cont.)
...Two ravens?

TIPTREE
The other one is Bruce Wayne's.
(trembling)
He doesn't know anything about this.
You've got what you want.  There's no need
to --

PENGUIN
Thank you, Mr. Tiptree.  You may go.

TIPTREE stands.  He backs away from the suitcase warily.

TIPTREE
My family.  You won't --

PENGUIN
We'll certainly take your unexpected
generosity into consideration.

TIPTREE
We -- ?!?
(shielding his eyes)
You're not Batman.

PENGUIN
No.  I'm his brother-in-law -- Birdman.
Now move out.

INT. TUNNEL - HIGH ANGLE - THAT MOMENT

TIPTREE marches slowly down the tracks, TOWARD CAMERA,
silhouetted in the flashlight beam.  The beam SHIFTS SLIGHTLY
as the Penguin moves toward the suitcase and sets the light
down --

-- and we catch sight of the CATWOMAN perched on a steel
cross-girder above the rails, her CHROME-STEEL TALONS GLINTING
as she waits for TIPTREE to pass underneath.

INT. TUNNEL - ON TIPTREE

looking increasingly twitchy as he approaches the cross-
girder.  He slips a hand into the pocket of his topcoat,
WHIRLS SUDDENLY --

-- and brings up his .38 AUTOMATIC, firing THREE QUICK SHOTS
at the PENGUIN.  The shots RICOCHET LOUDLY off the umbrella --
which happens to be a bulletproof job.  The PENGUIN lifts his
brolly; FIRE SPITS out of the shaft --

-- and TIPTREE staggers backward.  SHOT IN THE CHEST.  He
spins into a steel upright and topples, face-forward, onto the
ELECTRIFIED THIRD RAIL -- FRYING HIMSELF in a shower of
sparks.

The smoke is still clearing when the CATWOMAN drops to the
tracks.  The PENGUIN rushes to her side to check TIPTREE for
signs of life.

CATWOMAN
That idiot.  Another six feet --

PENGUIN
So sorry to spoil your fun.  -- He brought
two ravens.  We've got a complete set!

CATWOMAN
What??

PENGUIN
Yeah!  They're in the suitcase --

An AWFUL RUMBLING fills the tunnel.  They see the lights of a
TRAIN approaching on the center track -- the same one they're
standing on, the one TIPTREE's body is slumped across.  The
PENGUIN's first impulse is to run back toward the inner track,
where the ravens lie, but the CATWOMAN is trying to drag
TIPTREE out of the train's path...

CATWOMAN
GIVE ME A HAND!

They pull the corpse onto the outer express track just as the
train arrives.  They stand against the outer wall, waiting for
the train to pass...

...and when it does, they see DICK -- the boy vigilante --
standing on the inner track directly across from them.
HOLDING THE SUITCASE.  The kid takes off like a shot.  The
CATWOMAN and the PENGUIN exchange quick looks of utter
disbelief -- and BOLT AFTER DICK.

INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK

The bulky suitcase is slowing his progress.  He looks back
over his shoulder; although the stubby-legged PENGUIN has
fallen well behind, the CATWOMAN is gaining fast.



PAGE 101 MISSING FROM HARD COPY



INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK

watching in the light from the train as the two costumed
figures grapple in the distance.  He races back toward the
scene of the melee...

INT. TUNNEL - OUTTER EXPRESS TRACK - THAT MOMENT

...where BATMAN and the CATWOMAN are trading punches, blow for
blow.  He knocks her off her feet with a vicious right hook,
and she sprawls on the track, dazed and bleeding.  She lifts a
hand: no mas...

He looks back toward the suitcase on the center track.  Before
he can make a move toward it, he spots ANOTHER TRAIN
approaching on the outer tracks -- right on the heels of the
last one.  He crouches to pull the CATWOMAN's limp frame out
of its path...

...but as he does so, a HORN BLARES -- and a SECOND TRAIN
comes barrelling down the center track from the opposite
direction!  Now he's got trains approaching on either side,
and there's no place to go --

The CATWOMAN is groggily getting to her feet.  He LUNGES at
her -- THRUSTS HER BACKWARD, toward an ALCOVE in the outer
tunnel wall.

INT. TUNNEL - ON DICK - THAT MOMENT

The OUTER train is already speeding past, obscuring BATMAN and
the CATWOMAN from view.  The CENTER train is bearing down
fast.  A split-second before it arrives, DICK'S HAND snatches
the suitcase out of its path -- and he TUMBLES TO SAFETY on
the innermost LOCAL TRACK.

He stands and watches as the two trains pass in opposite
directions.  He doesn't know if BATMAN is alive or dead...

INT. ALCOVE - THAT MOMENT

BATMAN and CATWOMAN are flattened in the tiny alcove --
there's not two inches of breathing space between them and the
passing TRAIN.  She's come around now, and she's FLAILING and
CLAWING at him, trying to PUSH HIM OUT.

HER HAND closes around his UTILITY BELT.  As they struggle,
she hits the trigger of a SMALL GAS CYLINDER...

It's BRUCE's hydraulic BATWING DEVICE -- the one that saved
him when he fell off the roof.  But this time the results are
altogether different.  He GASPS IN HORROR as the WINGS OF HIS
CAPE stiffen and inflate -- FORCING HIM AWAY FROM THE WALL OF
THE TUNNEL.

His OUTER WING strikes the TRAIN -- FLAPPING WILDLY against
the passing CARS -- SNAGGING FINALLY on the ralling of the
rearmost car --

-- and BATMAN is suddenly RIPPED OUT OF THE ALCOVE -- DRAGGED
OFF DOWN THE TRACKS by the passing train!

INT. TUNNEL - INNERMOST TRACK - ON DICK

He's still there with the suitcase -- waiting apprehensively
to see what's become of BATMAN.  Finally the center train
passes --

-- and he sees CATWOMAN standing ALONE IN THE ALCOVE --
smiling at him -- advancing menacingly.  DICK TURNS TO RUN...

A GUNSHOT rings out -- and the last thing he sees as he slumps
to the tracks is a whiff of SMOKE pluming from the shaft of
the PENGUIN'S UMBRELLA.

The PENGUIN's panting -- soaked with sweat.  The CATWOMAN
snatches up the suitcase and rushes over to join him.  She
peers off into the tunnels after BATMAN, exhilarated...

CATWOMAN
God.  Did you see him? Isn't he hot?

PENGUIN
Haven't you got anything else to think
about?
(mopping sweat from his brow)
I'm hot.  That was exhausting.

CATWOMAN
No pain, no gain!  -- Suck it up.  We're
not out of here yet.

She sprints off down the tracks.  SQUAWKING, he waddles along
behind her, as fast as his fat little legs will carry him...

As they vanish into the darkness, the CAMERA TRACKS back --
past DICK, who lies unconscious on the tracks, bleeding
heavily from his shoulder wound -- DEEPER INTO THE MAZE OF
TUNNELS --

-- arriving finally on the ragged black figure of BATMAN as he
staggers forth from the shadows, dazed and bloody.  He scans
the tunnel, finding no trace of his enemies -- and then his
gaze falls on DICK.

He limps over and KNEELS at the boy's side -- cradling his
head protectively, staring helplessly into the blackness all
around him...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GOTHAM CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT

The stark outlines of the city, BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.  CAMERA
ZEROES IN on the glowing, ornamental DOME of CITY HALL...

INT. CITY HALL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A PENTAGONAL BALCONY girds the interior of the dome.  We TILT
DOWN to ground level -- where TWO AGED SECURITY GUARDS lie
sprawled at odd angles on the marble floor, FATALLY SHOT.

The PENGUIN closes his gun-umbrella and waddles across the
atrium of City Hall, past a statue of blind Justice, to a
point directly under the dome.  There, encased in a plexiglass
case, is a SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM CITY -- circa 1885, when City
Hall was erected.  He shouts up:

PENGUIN
LETS DO IT!

INT. CITY HALL - BALCONY UNDER DOME - THAT MOMENT

The CATWOMAN, FRICK, and FRACK are already up on the balcony.
Lining its periphery are various DISPLAY CASES of historical
interest; and positioned along the wall at each point of the
pentagon are FIVE ARCHED NICHES -- each one containing a
bronze bust.  The patriarchs of Gotham's Five Families...

The CATWOMAN and co. go to work quickly.  She removes the FIVE
RAVENS from a gunny sack as FRICK and FRACK work their way
around the balcony, YANKING the busts from their recessed
bases.  She follows along behind them, replacing each bust
with a RAVEN.

When they're done, the PENGUIN yells up:

PENGUIN
Now.  Give each raven a quarter-turn.

His pals in the dome oblige -- TWISTING each raven in its
recessed socket, in quick succession...

INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN

The moment of maximum tension.  He stands there frothing at
the mouth with anticipation.  SECONDS TICK OFF, and nothing
happens.

CATWOMAN
What happens now?

PENGUIN
I don't know.  That's all...!

He looks around expectantly as the others peer down at him
from above.  He really doesn't know what's supposed to happen
next.  Suspecting the worst, he throws his umbrella to the
floor and begins STAMPING ABOUT IN A RAGE, SPUTTERING,
flapping his arms like wings.

PENGUIN (cont.)
We've been TRICKED!  It's a HOAX!  It's
a --

He SHUTS UP suddenly at the sound of a loud CHUNK.  Somewhere
behind him, ANCIENT GEARS are beginning to grind.  He spins
and stares at the SCALE MODEL of GOTHAM in its plexiglass
case...

The city model is TREMBLING slightly.  As he watches, the DOME
of the miniature CITY HALL -- in the dead center of the model
city -- POPS OFF on a hinge.  A METAL STRONGBOX rises into
view...

INT. DOME - ON BALCONY - THAT MOMENT

The CATWOMAN, FRICK and FRACK stare down at the little metal
box.  The PENGUIN is already clambering atop the plexiglass
case of the model, SMASHING AT IT with his umbrella, trying to
get at the box.

FRICK
That's the treasure?

CATWOMAN
No.  It's a map...

She affixes a ROPE to the balcony railing and CLIMBS OVER.

INT. CITY HALL - ATRIUM - ON PENGUIN

The plexiglass case finally SHATTERS -- and the PENGUIN falls
through, landing atop Gotham City.  He snatches at the
strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a
colossus.  He's climbing down off the tabletop when the
CATWOMAN, on her rope, touches down behind him.

He hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off
the box.  He opens it and stares greedily at the contents -- a
MAP and a bunch of old, crumbling PHOTOS.  The CATWOMAN creeps
over to his side:

PENGUIN
Bruce Wayne.  So he doesn't know a thing
about the treasure, eh...?
(handing her the map)
Look at this.  It's right under Wayne
Manor.  It's been there all along!

Now the CATWOMAN snatches at the PHOTOS.  They show
progressively closer views of ANCIENT GNARLED STALACTITES --
an odd, distinctive SUBTERRANEAN ROCK FORMATION...

PENGUIN (cont.)
Looks like some kind of cave.

FADE THROUGH TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

TIGHT ON THE FACE of DICK.  He lies unconscious in a big soft
frilly bed A WOMAN'S HAND wipes his feverish brow with a damp
cloth; he moans slightly...

His eyes snap open suddenly.  He sits BOLT UPRIGHT with a
yelp.

VICKI
No, no -- don't try to get up -- you're
hurt.

He pushes her aside and climbs out of bed anyway.  His
shoulder is bandaged, his arm in a sling.  The pajamas he's
wearing are three sizes too large.  He paces about, staring at
his unfamiliar surroundings.

VICKI (cont.)
It's all right.  You're safe.  You can
stay here as long as you need to.

DICK
I don't belong here.  You can't keep me
here.

Vaguely unnerved, he goes to a window, pulls back the shades,
looks out at the grounds.

VICKI
It's ""Dick"", isn't it?  Or do you prefer
""Richard""?

He stares at her as if she's nuts.  VICKI opens a closet door:
all of his ratty belongings are hanging inside -- including
the red-and-green GYMNAST'S SUIT with the ""R"" insigne on the
breast.

VICKI
""R"" -- for Richard, right?  See, all your
things are here...
(staring at the costume)
What is it, some kind of gymnast's outfit?

DICK
It's none of your business.  What is this,
some kind of home?

VICKI
No, not that kind.  There's a swimming
pool -- tennis court -- you can have
anything you want.

DICK
Tennis court?!  -- Lady, you're rich.  How
the hell would you know what I want?

VICKI tries to lay a soothing arm on his shoulder.  He bats it
away, pushes her aside and turns toward the door in
agitation --

DICK
I'm not staying.  You can't make me --

-- and sees BRUCE standing in the doorway looking at him.

BRUCE
I can make you.

DICK freezes -- as if BRUCE's mere presence has mesmerized
him.  The hint of a smile plays across his face: ohhhhh.  I'm
in Batman's house.

BRUCE (cont.)
Come on.  Wanna go at it?
(no response)
Look, kid -- like it or not, you're my
guest -- and long as you're here you might
as well enjoy it.

ALFRED appears with a tray of hot food and sets it down on a
bedside table.  DICK edges toward it and sits down.  He waits
for ALFRED to leave and then TUCKS IN HUNGRILY -- eyeing BRUCE
all the while.

BRUCE (cont.)
Will you two be okay in here?

VICKI nods yes.  BRUCE backs out of the room.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - OUTSIDE GUEST ROOM - DAY

BRUCE pulls the door shut.  ALFRED follows him down the hall.

ALFRED
What do you propose to do with him, sir?
Keep him in the room for the rest of his
life?

BRUCE
I don't know, Alfred.  I've got other
stuff to worry about.

ALFRED
The child is hurt, sir.  At the very least
we should attempt to locate his parents.

BRUCE
He hasn't got any parents.

ALFRED
How do you know that, sir?

BRUCE turns and fixes ALFRED with a steely gaze.

BRUCE
...I know.

The PHONE RINGS as BRUCE starts down the long stairway.
ALFRED picks up a hallway extension.  He covers the
mouthpiece:

ALFRED
Sir -- it's Miss Kyle.

BRUCE rushes back upstairs to take the call.

INT. PENGUIN'S LAIR - THAT MOMENT - DAY

ARCTIC BIRDS chirping all around in the penguin-pool room.  A
SNOW OWL struts across the PENGUIN's desk as SELINA makes a
phone call -- with the PENGUIN, FRICK, and FRACK hovering over
her.

SELINA
Well!  Tall, dark and handsome.  Are we
still on for tonight?

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON BRUCE

He covers the receiver and stares intensely at ALFRED.  On his
look we

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WAYNE MANOR - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

Christmas carols playing.  VICKI's got DICK helping her trim
the tree.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

BRUCE is getting dressed for his date with SELINA.

ALFRED
Is this necessary, sir?  After all...it is
Christmas eve.

BRUCE reaches for his UTILITY BELT.  He empties the contents
of one packet onto a dresser: a dozen tiny, red GLASSINE
CAPSULES.  He scoops up a handful of the CAPSULES and deposits
them in his jacket pocket.

BRUCE
Stuff'll knock out a moose, much less a
cat.

ALFRED
I don't like to see you going out on a
date...unprotected, sir.

BRUCE
She'll be ready for Batman -- but not for
me.
(turning to go)
It's the only way, Alfred.  I've got to
take her out tonight.

INT. ENTRY HALL - FIVE MINUTES LATER (DICK'S POV)

DICK watches from the front parlor as VICKI meets BRUCE at the
bottom of the stairs.  The two of them exchange a few brief
words; he embraces her, strokes her hair gently -- then glumly
sets his jaw and moves off toward the front door.

VICKI reenters the parlor, trying to force an expression of
cheer as DICK turns discreetly away.  This is one weird
household he's landed in...

INT. SELINA'S LOFT - NIGHT

SOFT MUSIC plays in the background as SELINA preens in front
of a vanity, doing her eye makeup, taking great pleasure in
her own reflection.  She's looking especially sultry tonight
in a glittering low-cut gown.  She lowers one shoulder strap
and strikes a pose in the mirror: better.  She runs a hand
through her hair, TOUSLING IT for that recently-ravished look.

The DOORBELL rings, and by the time SELINA crosses over to
answer it, she's lowered the other strap as well -- which
means she has to hold up the top of her dress with one hand.
BRUCE finds himsell dumbstruck as she lets him in.  She pulls
up both straps as she greets him nonchalantly:

SELINA
You're early.  I'm afraid I'm not quite
dressed.

BRUCE enters and takes a long look around.  It's a big open
loft, only partly finished, filled with Egyptian artifacts.
The walls feature modern paintings with CAT MOTIFS.  The
finished section is dominated by a huge BED on a raised
platform -- three or four CATS are walking around on it,
yowling at BRUCE.  SELINA CHUCKLES as he scopes it all out.

SELINA (cont.)
If you're looking for my bondage gear,
it's at the cleaners.

BRUCE
Christmas eve.  No tree?

SELINA
No presents.  I've been a bad girl this
year.

BRUCE takes a seat on the sofa while SELINA goes to a nearby
wet bar.

BRUCE
I'm surprised you kept this date.  I
thought you would've lost interest by now.

SELINA
What makes you say that?

BRUCE
You've got what you want, don't you?

SELINA
I do now.
(smiling)
We've had this date for a long, long time.

With that, she sets the drinks down on the table and moves in
to KISS him -- a long, slow, wet kiss.  But BRUCE seems
strangely unresponsive.  She breaks free and gives him a funny
look.

BRUCE
How much is it going to cost me?

SELINA
What?

BRUCE
...To get the ravens back.

He watches her closely for a reaction.  SELINA's shocked, but
she conceals it well -- chuckling in apparent confusion.

SELINA
You're the oddest man I've ever met.
(moving in on him)
Let's talk later, Bruce.  I've got kind of
a short fuse...

BRUCE tenses slightly as she KISSES him again -- leaving a
crimson LIPSTICK SMEAR on his cheek.  She works her way
downward, kissing him around his neck and throat...

HIS HAND reaches into his jacket pocket.  He withdraws a tiny
GLASSINE CAPSULE.  But before he can use it --

He JERKS BACK suddenly -- pushes her away.  His free hand goes
to his neck, where a thin trickle of BLOOD is oozing from
between two bright red LIPSTICK LIPS.  She's bitten him...

Now she SHUSHES him -- reaches over to the tiny wound and
massages it gently with one hand.

SELINA
Did I hurt you?  Just relax -- you'll
start to enjoy it.

BRUCE pulls away again.  His eyes are strangely glazed.  He
tries to speak, but his tongue feels thick and swollen.

SELINA (cont.)
Bruce, you look faint.  It must be the
cats.

BRUCE stands suddenly.  It's as if he's mired in a slo-mo
nightmare.  His legs give way beneath him and he topples to
the floor, INERT.  His fingers go slack and the capsule rolls
out; he tries to reach into his pocket, but his arm won't seem
to work.

SELINA's cat, HECATE, strolls across his prostrate form --
purring and stretching...

BRUCE'S POV

A worm's-eye view -- SELINA looms over him with a predatory
smile on her face, shifting in and out of focus.

BRUCE
What di-- what did you d--

She runs a finger across her lips and holds it up -- bright
red.

SELINA
I guess I've...gotten under your skin.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

His hand goes to the BITE on his neck -- and he realizes
SELINA's lipstick is spiked with a fast-acting PARALYTIC DRUG.
He writhes helplessly on the carpet, his whole body gradually
going slack.

The PENGUIN, FRICK and FRACK stroll through the doorway and
stand over him -- ALL LAUGHING...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

A COUNTY SHERIFF'S CAR cruises past the manor, right on
schedule.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - PARLOR - NIGHT

ALFRED on the telephone, checking in with the County Sheriff's
boys.

ALFRED
Everything's fine, thank you.  We'll talk
in an hour.

Behind him, VICKI is waiting up for BRUCE.  She's curled up on
the sofa, reading a book, throwing the occasional anxious
glance at a big grandfather clock -- which strikes eleven
o'clock.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

DICK opens the bedroom door and peeks down the hall.  He's got
all his belongings tied up in a bundle on the bed; he opens a
window and throws the bundle outside.

There's a nice strong TREE BRANCH some ten or twelve feet from
the window -- just close enough that he should be able to make
it.  He climbs up onto the windowsill, crouches, and SPRINGS.

INT. CAR - OUTSIDE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A car full of trouble: SELINA, wearing a fur coat over her
Catwoman garb, at the wheel; the PENGUIN riding shotgun; and
FRICK in the back seat -- next to BRUCE, who's semi-conscious
and stone limp.  The car idles outside the wrought-iron gates
of Wayne Manor.

PENGUIN
Try his mag card.

FRICK digs in BRUCE's pockets and finds a bunch of RED
CAPSULES.

FRICK
Look at this.  He's a pillhead.

Now FRICK finds a mag-striped card and INSERTS IT into an
electronic device at the edge of the drive.  The gates
magically part.  There's a large VAN just behind the car --
driven by FRACK, and carrying two random GOONS.  Both vehicles
pull in before the gates slide shut.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - A MOMENT LATER

VICKI hears a signal from the security panel in the kitchen
announcing what should be BRUCE's arrival.  She heaves a huge
sigh of relief -- then rushes to the door and flings it open.

She sees BRUCE standing there and her face lights up.

VICKI
Ohh.  Am I glad to --

To her horror, BRUCE topples forward -- and lands on the
floor, flat as a board.  VICKI SHRIEKS as the PENGUIN enters,
throwing his arms wide.

PENGUIN
MER-R-R-RY CHRISTMAS!!

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

DICK has shimmied down to a lower branch.  He lets go and
drops to the snow, WINCING; his shoulder wound is bleeding
again.  As he grabs his bundle, he hears RAUCOUS LAUGHTER
coming from around the house.

He races over to peer around the corner.  He sees the two cars
out front.  He sees the last of the goon squad barging in
through the front door.

His face full of confusion and conflict, he moves to a window.
In the entry hall he sees BRUCE on the floor -- and VICKI
surrounded by gun-toting intruders.  One of them grabs her and
twists her arm behind her back.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT

VICKI shrieking and struggling as she stares down at BRUCE.

VICKI
What did you do to him??

SELINA gives her a catty little smile.

SELINA
First-time jitters, I guess.  Everything
was going great, and then...he just went
limp as a noodle.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ON STAIRWAY

Drawn by the commotion, ALFRED rushes down the stairs to the
entry hall, pulling a robe around him.  He freezes in his
tracks when he sees FRICK dragging VICKI into the front
parlor, holding a gun to her head.

PENGUIN
You'd be the butler.  Why don't you come
on down and attend to your guests?

ALFRED hesitates, until the PENGUIN pulls a gun on him.  He
marches down the stairs slowly, pausing by BRUCE's prostrate
form.

ALFRED
Mr. Wayne.  Is he -- ?

PENGUIN
You know how it is.  Some guys just can't
hold their egg nog.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER

The PENGUIN marches ALFRED in where the rest of the gang's
already assembled.  FRICK throws VICKI down roughly on a sofa
just next to the Christmas tree while the GOONS drag BRUCE
inside.

PENGUIN
I should explain the occasion of our
visit.  There's a treasure underneath this
house -- and I don't plan to leave until
you tell me how to find it.  Now who's
going to talk -- Miss Vale?

VICKI
I don't know what you're talking about.

PENGUIN
The cave.  Under the house.  How do I get
there?

The PENGUIN gestures.  FRICK holds the gun to her head.

VICKI (cont.)
I don't know!  I swear, I would tell
you --

PENGUIN
(turning to ALFRED)
Then maybe you'd like to tell me.

ALFRED
You're no more than a common thief.

PENGUIN
Wrong, you old idiot.  I happen to be a
very uncommon thief.
(beat)
Are you going to tell me, or does Miss
Vale get an early present this year?

FRICK cocks the gun.  VICKI stares aghast at ALFRED, who scans
the room, weighing his options.  Trembling, he shuts his
eyes --

ALFRED
I...don't...know...

PENGUIN
Then go ahead, Mr. Frick...decorate the
tree.

FRICK's finger tightens on the trigger.  VICKI winces.  ALFRED
starts to blurt something out.  But a split-second before he
can speak --

SELINA
Wait!
(crossing over to VICKI)
We don't know how to get down there yet.
We may need her when Bruce wakes up.

The PENGUIN sighs and waves FRICK off.  ALFRED and VICKI heave
simultaneous sighs of relief.  He throws her a shamefaced look
-- but she gives him a tiny nod of acknowledgement: you made
the right play.

SELINA (cont.)
Besides -- I want this one for myself.  So
pretty...I'm going to give her a brand new
face for Christmas.

The PENGUIN throws a look at BRUCE, who's still out cold on
the floor.  He turns to FRICK and FRACK.

PENGUIN
Why don't you two tie up our host?

ALFRED sits beside VICKI while SELINA wanders off to tour the
premises.  FRICK and FRACK, meanwhile, drag BRUCE into a back
parlor which opens off the room they're in.

INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

They dump BRUCE face down on a sofa -- then rip the telephone
cords from around the baseboard and use them to bind his hands
and feet.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON MR. BONIFACE

Still holding his gun on VICKI and ALFRED, he wanders about
the room, admiring the various furnishings and expensive
objects.

PENGUIN
It's all so plush and tasteful, isn't it?
Just the sort of setting in which I've
always imagined myself.

ALFRED, on the sofa, can't resist letting out a snort of
disgust.

PENGUIN (cont.)
I see.  You think I'm vulgar.  You think
I'm...nouveau.

ALFRED
I think you're a dirty little man with
a --

The PENGUIN silences him by sweeping one arm across a
tabletop, sending a bunch of PRICELESS CHINA FIGURINES
crashing to the floor.  He points to ALFRED as FRICK and FRACK
reappear.

PENGUIN
See, boys, that's old money talking.
After a while, they actually start to
believe they've earned all this.
(smirking)
I don't mind.  Someday I'll be old money
too -- when the statute of limitations
runs out.

SELINA (O.S.)
Hey!  -- Guess what I just found.

Face full of anticipation, he TURNS -- just in time to see
SELINA returning from the kitchen with a big silver tray of...

SELINA (cont.)
Christmas cookies!

The PENGUIN is crestfallen, but that doesn't stop him from
cramming a handful of cookies down his gullet.  SELINA
graciously serves VICKI and ALFRED, who munch away with
limited enthusiasm.

PENGUIN
Let's spread out and see what we can find.
(to FRICK and FRACK)
You two -- keep an eye on our friends
here.  Give me a yell the minute Wayne
comes to.

FRICK and FRACK post themselves at the doors to the front
parlor as SELINA, the PENGUIN and the GOONS fan out through
the house.  CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they move past BRUCE --

-- and in a quick CLOSEUP we see his EYES OPEN -- his hands
STRUGGLING against his bonds.

SERIES OF SHOTS

QUICK GLIMPSES of the intruders enacting their depredations as
they search for the entrance to the cave.  SELINA and the
PENGUIN are flinging open doors, moving clocks, looking for
secret panels; as they go, they systematically TEAR THE HOUSE
APART -- smashing BRUCE's possessions, ripping paintings out
of frames, etc.

Meanwhile, the TWO GOONS are outside prowling around the
grounds, looking for an exterior entrance -- and back in the
parlor, FRICK and FRACK are keeping their guns trained on
ALFRED and VICKI.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS down a long, empty hallway -- arriving at a
LOCKED DOOR with curtained-off glass panels.  Suddenly, an
ELBOW smashes through the glass -- a hand reaches inside and
fumbles for the lock --

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

FRICK and FRACK start at the sound of a SECURITY ALARM blaring
from the kitchen.  VICKI looks at ALFRED...

FRICK
Better check it out.

FRICK stays behind as FRACK rushes out into the entryway and
down a long hall to the kitchen.  He tosses a glance back at
VICKI and ALFRED, then steps out into the entryway himself.

FRICK (cont.)
What is it?  What's going on??

VICKI and ALFRED look into the back parlor.  DICK GRAYSON has
sneaked in behind the sofa -- and he's busy sawing away at
BRUCE's bonds with a letter opener.  Both of them stiffen
simultaneously -- if FRICK steps back inside, he'll have a
clear view of DICK and BRUCE.

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

FRACK has opened a panel on the kitchen wall, revealing the
SECURITY SYSTEM from which the alarm emanates.  A RED LIGHT is
blinking, indicating DICK's break-in.  FRACK throws switches
frantically, trying to kill the sound.  Finally he succeeds --
and SHOUTS:

FRACK
Some kind of security system --

INT. BACK PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

DICK's gotten BRUCE free -- but BRUCE, still under the effects
of the drug, isn't much use.  He tries to get off the sofa and
crumples in a heap.

DICK
Can you move, man?

BRUCE
Library -- got to get me to the library --

DICK slings an arm around BRUCE and drags him to a door
opening onto the hallway.  They're just about to step outside
when FRACK comes marching back on his way from the kitchen.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - ON VICKI AND ALFRED

-- faces wracked with utter, desperate tension as they watch
the situation develop.

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

FRICK and FRACK conferring, ignoring VICKI and ALFRED for the
moment.  By now the PENGUIN is waddling in from a hallway:

PENGUIN
What is that ungodly racket?

FRACK
A security alarm.  It went off in the
kitchen.

PENGUIN
My God!  Is someone in here?

He struts over to huddle with his cronies.  BRUCE and DICK are
still poised in the doorway.  It looks bad...

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

ALFRED looks at BRUCE and DICK -- then at FRICK and FRACK
bickering with the PENGUIN in the entryway.  He pats VICKI's
knee -- gestures for her to keep her seat --

-- and LUNGES at FRICK, making a play for his gun.  A moment
of confusion ensues -- giving DICK and BRUCE just enough time
to dart out into the hallway, duck around a corner, and
vanish --

-- but ALFRED is a frail old gent, and he can't keep it up for
long; a blow to the face sends him sprawling to the floor.
FRICK instinctively pulls the trigger and SHOOTS HIM at point-
blank range.

VICKI rushes into the hallway -- screaming, crying.

INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT

The room's a mess, books all over the floor.  The groggy BRUCE
props himself up against his desk.  He manages to pull the
bottom drawer open -- gropes frantically for the secret
switch.  He's CRYING.

BRUCE
Alfred...

DICK
I'll go back.

BRUCE
I can't...get down there...without you.

DICK turns.  To his amazement, the sectional bookcase is
swinging open -- revealing the secret passage to the BATCAVE.

INT. ENTRY HALL/FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

We will all be pleased to know that ALFRED has only suffered a
superficial wound to the arm.  VICKI is on her knees beside
him; the PENGUIN is watching them with utter contempt.

PENGUIN
What an extraordinarily stupid thing to
do.

VICKI
SHUT UP.  Help me with him.

The PENGUIN rolls his eyes and orders FRICK and FRACK to give
VICKI a hand without him.  They carry him into the parlor, lay
him out on the sofa.  VICKI reaches into her purse for a
handkerchief and begins binding his wound as the PENGUIN pulls
FRACK aside.

PENGUIN
You and I had better check the ground
floor and see what's going on.  Mr. Frick
-- do you think you'll be able to manage
this pair?

FRICK
Yes sir.

PENGUIN
Oh, good.  That does relieve my mind --

He turns, glances into the back parlor, and sees a pile of CUT
CORDS on the love seat.  The blood drains out of his face.

PENGUIN (cont.)
Where's Wayne???

INT. BATCAVE - THAT MOMENT

DICK has just entered another world -- and he's looking around
him in pure, unalloyed amazement.  BRUCE is fumbling with a
packet on a spare UTILITY BELT; he shakes out a fistful of
pills and swallows them dry.

Then he goes to his bank of monitors and begins flipping
switches.  They blink on one by one; DICK moves up behind
BRUCE and looks on, dazzled.

INSERT - MONITOR

The screen shows The PENGUIN in a sun room, shouting to his
two armed GOONS through a pair of French doors.

PENGUIN
Check the grounds!  The shape he's in, he
can't have gotten far.

BACK TO SCENE - ON BRUCE

He turns to his main control panel, reaches for a switch, and
waits.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The two GOONS outside, with guns and flashlights, roaming
cautiously around the grounds.  They turn suddenly --

-- as CORRUGATED-STEEL SECURITY PANELS slam into place over
every ground-floor door and window in Wayne Manor!

INT. SUN ROOM - THAT MOMENT

The PENGUIN sees the same thing happening, only from inside.
He listens helplessly as his GOONS pound on the steel panels
from outside.  It's just occurred to him that he's trapped in
here...

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER

DICK is up on a catwalk leading back to the library of Wayne
Manor.  BRUCE shouts up to him from the control console down
below.

BRUCE
-- as soon as he gets to the East wing.
Wait for my signal.  You know what to do.

DICK nods yes and bolts off.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - A MOMENT LATER

VICKI and ALFRED are still sitting at gunpoint.  With the
commotion going on all around them, FRICK is getting itchy-
fingered.

Suddenly the STEREO begins blaring at top volwne -- ""SANTA
BRING MY BABY BACK TO ME.""  FRICK turns and stares at it in
confusion -- goes over to fiddle with the controls --

-- and suddenly BRUCE'S VOICE is coming through the
loudspeakers.

BRUCE (O.S.; filter)
VICKI!  RUN!  NOW!

She's off the sofa like a shot, DIVING for the entry hall.
FRICK turns and takes aim --

-- but before he can squeeze the trigger, DICK's come out of
nowhere to HIGH-KICK him in the face!  The shot goes wild and
the two of them tumble into the Christmas tree, knocking it
over...

INT. ENTRY HALL - THAT MOMENT

VICKI hits the floor of the entry hall.  HUGE OAKEN SLIDING
DOORS are already slamming shut behind her.  The same thing is
happening all down the hall -- the East wing of the house is
sealing itself off!

INT. FRONT PARLOR - THAT MOMENT

DICK CARTWHEELS across the carpet -- catching FRICK high on
the chest and RAMMING him backward, into the hearth.  Before
FRICK can regain his balance, DICK's BEANED HIM across the
back of the skull with a fireplace poker.

He bends and picks up FRICK's gun -- which he tosses to
ALFRED, who's been watching all this with some fascination
from the sofa.

DICK
Here.  You might need it.

ALFRED
Thank you, Master Dick.  And...bravo.

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

VICKI has made it to the wall phone.  She can't seem to get a
dial tone --

VOICE FROM BEHIND
Do you really think we're that stupid?

VICKI turns, and realizes to her horror that the VOICE is
SELINA's.

SELINA (cont.)
I tawt I taw a puddy tat...!!

With that she raises a hand -- and her CLAWS pop out.  VICKI
turns, grabs a carving knife from a wooden block -- but before
she can do anything with it, a WHIP cracks and wraps around
her wrist, jerking the knife loose.  SELINA tugs on the other
end, reeling her closer.

SELINA
You know, I've got a great recipe for
Sliced Bitch --

VICKI lunges forward suddenly, causing the whip to slacken and
throwing SELINA off-balance into the center island.  While
they're tangled up, VICKI grabs a MEAT CLEAVER and tries to
bring it down on SELINA, but SELINA rolls effortlessly out of
the way and returns the favor, SWIPING at VICKI with her
claws.  VICKI brings a Calphalon skillet up just in time to
block the blow: CLANG.

VICKI sweeps her arm across the countertop, showering SELINA
with knives and appliances.  It buys her enough time to make
for the door -- but SELINA comes flying after her.  Another
downswipe with the claws -- but VICKI shoves a BUTCHER'S BLOCK
into SELINA's path, and her TALONS wedge a half-inch deep in
the wood.

VICKI rushes out while she's trying to pry herself loose.

INT. DINING HALL - A MOMENT LATER

SELINA enters but finds no trace of VICKI.

SELINA
I love a good old-fashioned catfight --
but this is pissing me off.

VICKI charges out from behind a sideboard, pushing a WHEELED
COCKTAIL CART before her.  It SLAMS full-force into SELINA,
who lands on her back on the great long dining table.  VICKI
is in the doorway to the entry hall by the time she gets up.

INT. ENTRY HALL - STAIRWAY - A MOMENT LATER

VICKI races up the stairs.  She has a good lead, but SELINA
makes up the difference in a hurry.  She takes the stairway in
three giant bounds -- reaches the landing just as VICKI ducks
down the hall and into a bedroom, slamming the door behind her
and LOCKING IT.

SELINA
HERE, kitty kitty kitty...HERE, kitty
kitty...

She KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.

INT. BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT

SELINA enters and strikes a coy pose as she shuts the door
behind her.  VICKI has opened a pair of French doors leading
to a balcony, but it's too long a drop.  She stands there
paralyzed as SELINA advances.

SELINA
So this is where you earn your keep.

She GRABS VICKI -- holds her out at arm's length and shoves
her roughly back onto the bed.  VICKI flails wildly as SELINA
kneels atop her...

SELINA's CLAWS shred VICKI's blouse, revealing a frilly
section of bra --

SELINA
Mmm!  Frederick's of Gotham?

She plants a talon against VICKI's sternum and RAKES IT
DOWNWARD, drawing a RED STRIPE on the exposed flesh of VICKI's
belly.  Now VICKI just loses it.  She begins to SHRIEK
uncontrollably.

SELINA
Not so loud, honey!  The neighbors'll get
the wrong idea.
(laughing)
Santa's coming.  Time for all good girls
to go to sleep...

She raises her claw-hand and prepares to slash down at VICKI's
neck.  But an instant before she can strike -- VICKI goes
wide-eyed and shuts up.  A BLACK SHADOW falls across the
moonlit bed.  SELINA tenses --

-- as a BLACK-GLOVED HAND grabs a fistful of her hair --

BATMAN
Miss me, ""Angel""?

He yanks her bodily off the bed.  Before she knows what's
happening, he delivers a POWERHOUSE UPPERCUT.  She flies into
the door and knocks it cleanly off its hinges.

INT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - A MOMENT LATER

BATMAN steps out after SELINA, who's only now picking herself
up.

SELINA
Okay -- let's do it, huh?  You and me...
all the way this time.

She HISSES and jumps him.  They grapple -- a quick flurry of
fists -- and he knocks her ass-over-teakettle down the long
stairway.

She gets to her feet, limping, and darts around a corner.
BATMAN marches implacably down the stairs, taking his time...

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

VICKI rushes out of the bedroom.  She looks down the hall and
sees FRACK flying out of the guest room, UPSIDE DOWN --
slamming into the wall opposite.  He slumps to the carpet, out
cold.

A moment later DICK strolls out.  VICKI rushes to his side --

VICKI
Come on.  We'll be safe in the cave.

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY/ARMORY - A MOMENT LATER

BATMAN PAUSES outside the door to the armory, which is
slightly ajar.  He pushes it in cautiously...

...and a HALBERD smashes through the wood frame -- slicing
down mere inches from his face.  It's the PENGUIN wielding the
ax; he backs off in seeming terror as BATMAN advances on him.
But then --

-- SELINA springs down from a perch above the doors -- landing
on his back -- and the two of them are going at it again.
It's a room full of exotic weaponry, and most of it gets a
good workout in the next thirty seconds.

BATMAN dodges a LANCE -- which embeds itself into the wall
behind him, QUIVERING -- and swings a MACE squarely into
SELINA's ribs.  It's a crippling blow; she flies backward,
knocking over a suit of exotic armor -- which TOPPLES,
knocking over another -- and another --

-- until the various suits of armor have all fallen over,
domino-style -- the last of them landing squarely atop the
cowering PENGUIN.

SELINA is badly hurt now.  She makes it out of a rear door to
the armory.  BATMAN pauses to check on the PENGUIN -- he seems
to be out for the count -- and sets off in pursuit of SELINA.

SEVERAL MOMENTS PASS before the groaning PENGUIN comes around
enough to dig himself out.

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

As the PENGUIN stumbles around a corner, he peers into the
LIBRARY.  VICKI is crouched by BRUCE's desk, reaching into a
bottom drawer.  A hidden panel in the bookcase pops open...

INT. LIBRARY - THAT MOMENT

As she helps ALFRED into the secret passageway, VICKI turns to
DICK:

VICKI
Come on.  Come with us.

DICK
No.  I can still help...

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

The PENGUIN flattens against the wall as DICK sprints out of
the library and heads off in the opposite direction.  There's
a flabbergasted look on his face -- he recognizes this kid.

WIPE TO:

INT. BATCAVE - A MINUTE LATER

At the monitor bank, watching BATMAN's pursuit of SELINA, are
VICKI and ALFRED.  They pivot suddenly at the sound of a
VOICE:

PENGUIN
Such primitive entertainment.

He's holding a gun on the two of them.  He stares about
delightedly, taking in the prehistoric splendor of the cave.
His eyes light up at the sight of the BATMOBILE, parked on its
little plateau.

PENGUIN (cont.)
So Bruce equals Batman.  It seems I've
discovered two treasures!
(an evil smile)
Don't move.  I'd be only too happy to
shoot you both.

He pulls out his packet of photos and begins to scan the cave.
He spots the distinctive ROCK FORMATION in an upper vault of
the cavern.  It's a couple of plateaus over; a long narrow
CATWALK runs past it, some ten or twelve feet below.

PENGUIN
The Gotham City Treasury.  It's about to
be stolen twice.

ALFRED
Don't be absurd. You'll never be able to
get it out of here.

PENGUIN
Oh, I'll manage somehow.  You two are my
guarantee of that.
(nudging VICKI with the gun)
Let's have a look, shall we?  You go
first.

He shoves her.  She starts across the catwalk, his gun at her
head.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

SELINA's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter-
speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes
down the hallway.  She's just passed the balcony overlooking
the entry hall when BATMAN appears dead ahead in her path.

He's ready to rumble -- but instead of responding, she packs
it in.  She stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.

SELINA
It could've been so nice -- you and me --
if only you weren't so screwed up.

BATMAN
It's over.  I don't want to hurt you any
more.

SELINA
Tell me something -- one thing.  If you
don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?

He just looks at her.  He doesn't have an especially good
answer.  She sighs.

SELINA (cont.)
I'll never understand men.

She SPINS SUDDENLY, delivering a high-kick to BATMAN's throat.
As he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the
narrow BANNISTER RAILING some thirty feet above the entry hall
floor and goes into a CROUCH -- preparing to SPRING at the
enormous crystal CHANDELIER mounted to the ceiling --

-- but just as she launches off, BATMAN rolls -- and brings up
a GUN from his belt.  He fires a RAZOR-SHARP DISK which sails
past her head, cleanly SLICING THROUGH the chain which
suspends the chandelier.

The chandelier FALLS just as CATWOMAN catches hold of it --
and she finds herself PLUMMETING to the floor of the entry
hall.  On impact, the chandelier EXPLODES into a thousand
fragments; the CATWOMAN lands hard on her back and lies
sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving.

BATMAN advances slowly down the stairs.  Her arms and legs jut
out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering
YOWL OF PAIN -- a cri du chat.  He stands over her; she glares
up at him.

BATMAN
Nine lives.

CATWOMAN
I can't move.  I can't move.

Her face is cut and bleeding.  She tries to lift an arm and
can't quite manage it.  He crouches down beside her, still
cautious...

CATWOMAN (cont.)
DON'T LOOK AT ME!!
(pleading)
Do me, baby...do me now...that's what I
want.  Please?

BATMAN looks up.  DICK is standing on the balcony overlooking
them, highly curious as to what he'll do.

BATMAN
No.

BATMAN slowly rises to his feet.  She lets out another
gruesome WHINE.

CATWOMAN
COME ON.  Don't stop now.  FINISH ME OFF.
(almost weeping with pain)
Son of a bitch.  You're all alike...

Her STEEL CLAWS snick into place.  With an agonizing effort
she lifts her forearm -- bends her wrist.  She's trying to
slit her own throat.

He reaches for his belt, extracts a GLASSINE CAPSULE, and
breaks it open with his thumb.  He drops it amid the shattered
glass around her face.  A tiny cloud of GREEN GAS plumes out,
and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into
unconsciousness.

BATMAN stands over her for a minute as DICK marches down to
join him.

DICK
You should've done it, man.  You should've
killed her.

BATMAN gives him a long, hard look -- but says nothing.

BATMAN
There's a radio in the cave.  We'll send
for help.

INT. BATCAVE - A MOMENT LATER

The PENGUIN and VICKI are on a catwalk just below the ROCK
FORMATION.  A STONE OUTCROPPING extends toward the catwalk,
and he forces her to JUMP FOR IT.  Now he has to follow; the
prospect makes him nervous, but it's a short hop, and he
clears it okay -- finding his footing on the rocky slope.

They're cautiously making their way up toward the ROCK
FORMATION when BATMAN appears suddenly at the far end of the
catwalk -- sizes up the situation and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

PENGUIN
Ah, the illustrious Mr. Wayne.  Look at
you now.  Whatever would your friends say?
(smiling)
You've been an exceptionally congenial
host -- but I must ask you to back off.

The PENGUIN grabs hold of VICKI and HOLDS HER CLOSE as they
climb the last few feet toward the grotto.  BATMAN swings his
cape around, concealing his hands from view.  He takes a
cautious step backward.

CLOSEUP - BATMAN'S HAND

His free hand closes around a BATARANG -- flicks it open.

ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI

They've pulled almost even with the rock formation.  A LARGE
DANK GROTTO is visible through a small gap in the rocks.

PENGUIN
No sudden moves.  It's a long way down.

Gun at her head, he peers into the grotto...

HIS POV - INSIDE THE GROTTO

A VAST FORTUNE in GOLD and SILVER BULLION, undisturbed in all
these years.  GLINTING in the darkness.  Hanging upside-down,
above it, like silent guardians, are BATS -- DOZENS of them --
their tiny wet red eyes GLIMMERING at the PENGUIN...

He dislodges a rock.  It tumbles into the grotto...

...and a startled BAT comes screeching out of the gap in the
rocks -- FLYING DIRECTLY AT HIS FACE.

ANGLE ON ROCKS - PENGUIN AND VICKI

He BACKS AWAY IN HORROR as the bat streaks past him.  He FIRES
HIS GUN wildly.  The SOUND OF IT rouses MORE BATS, and they
come flying out of the hole -- a VAST, CHITTERING SWARM.
VICKI SHRIEKS; the PENGUIN STUMBLES -- and the two of them
FALL BACK ONTO THE ROCKS, hanging on for dear life.

BATMAN
VICKI!

An instant later BATMAN lets fly with the BATARANG.  Clean
hit; the PENGUIN staggers back, and his GUN skitters down
across the rocks.

With BATS screaming all around her, VICKI takes a deep breath
and VAULTS toward the CATWALK.  She's a foot short; she grabs
hold of the railing and HANGS THERE, over the ABYSS, trying to
pull herself up.  BATMAN races toward her --

-- but the PENGUIN, clambering down across the rocky
outcropping, has managed to grab hold of his GUN.  The BATS
have begun to swirl up toward the higher recesses of the
cavern, and he's able to draw a clean bead on BATMAN.

THUNDEROUS ECHOES reverberate through the cave as the first
shot strikes BATMAN and knocks him backward.  As the second
spins him around.  As the third sends him TOPPLING OVER THE
RAILING.

VICKI screams.  BATMAN manages to grab the rail with one hand.
Now two of them are hanging from the catwalk -- sitting ducks
-- and the PENGUIN is determined to empty the clip.

The ECHOES are cacophanous.  ANCIENT STALACTITES drop from the
vaulted roof of the cavern, PLUMMETING DOWNWARD like deadly
projectiles, shattering agaist the cave floor.  And then --

BATMAN pulls a tiny DEVICE from his utility belt and FLINGS
IT.  It lands in the rocks at the PENGUIN's feet.  He stares
down at it, and two beats later --

-- it begins to emit an EERIE ELECTRONIC WHINE.  Within
moments, EVERY BAT IN THE CAVE is in a FRENZY -- HOMING IN ON
THE SIGNAL.  The PENGUIN looks up sees them coming.  A CHOKED
WAIL emits from his throat as he drops the gun and stands
there, PARALYZED.

He's just been beaten at his own game.  He lets out a last
awful HOWL as HUNDREDS OF BATS ENGULF HIM --

-- and he PLUNGES DOWN INTO THE PIT -- his hideous scream
dwindling to a faint echo, then vanishing altogether...

BATMAN manages to drag himself up onto the catwalk.  He rushes
over to VICKI, pulls her up, drapes his cape around her
protectively.  Gradually, as the BATS recede to their distant
perches, he stands and helps VICKI to her feet.  They embrace
on the edge of the abyss.

On the far plateau, DICK has hooked up with ALFRED.  The
butler is slumped against a lab table, weary and exhausted,
clutching his wounded arm.  DICK slings an arm around him and
helps him to the stairway.

CUT TO:

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

SQUAD CARS everywhere.  FRICK and FRACK emerge in handcuffs,
flanked by COPS.  PARAMEDICS carry the still-unconscious
SELINA past on a stretcher and load her into the back of an
ambulance.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

The place is an utter mess.  Amid the carnage we find BRUCE
conferring with COMMISSIONER GORDON and LT. BULLOCK.  In b.g.,
a POLICE DOCTOR is dressing ALFRED's gunshot wound.

GORDON
...and then Batman showed up?

BRUCE
He saved all our lives, Jim.  I can't say
for sure, but I'd bet she's the one behind
the murders.

GORDON
God -- I pray you're right.
(beat)
One thing before we go, Bruce.  Who's the
kid?

BRUCE looks into the front parlor, where VICKI and DICK are
righting the fallen Christmas tree.

BRUCE
Oh, that's Vicki's little cousin.  He's in
town for the holidays.

GORDON
Well, he picked a hell of a time to visit.
(turning to go)
Merry Christmas, Bruce.  Good luck
cleaning this place up.

GORDON and BULLOCK file out, followed by the POLICE DOCTOR.
BRUCE smiles wearily to himself and strolls into the front
parlor.

INT. FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

ALFRED loads 'SILENT NIGHT' on the CD.  VICKI ambles up to
BRUCE:

VICKI
What are you going to do with all that
gold?

BRUCE
I dunno.  Might be a good start on a place
to live -- for some people who don't have
one.

She hugs him.  DICK plugs in the Christmas-tree lights; they
blink to life just as the GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes twelve.

VICKI
It's Christmas.

BRUCE
Yeah.  Maybe you should -- open your
present.

She runs a hand along his cheek and laughs softly.

VICKI
Oh, Bruce, presents doesn't matter.  None
of it matters.  We're all safe.  We're
together.

BRUCE
...You might as well.

He digs around in his jacket pocket and produces a tiny GIFT
BOX, which he hands to VICKI.  She unwraps it, opens it slowly
-- and sees a DIAMOND RING inside.

She gazes up at him, speechless.  He gazes back.

CAMERA PULLS UP and away until we can see the whole of the
devastated room, and all the people in it -- VICKI, falling
into BRUCE's arms; DICK, off to one side, watching them;
ALFRED, tossing broken furniture into a roaring fireplace.
And on the image of this decidedly eccentric family unit, we

FADE OUT.

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.

THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.


THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.

(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)

THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.
THE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!

THE CHILDREN Where's the great light?

THE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.

(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)

CISSY CAFFREY



I gave it to Molly
Because she was jolly,
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)

THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.

CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.

(She sings.)
I gave it to Nelly
To stick in her belly
The leg of the duck
The leg of the duck.


(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)

PRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.

PRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!

CISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)

She has it, she got it,
Wherever she put it
The leg of the duck.


(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)

STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.

(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)

THE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.
STEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.

THE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.

(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)

EDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.

STEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.

(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)

LYNCH So that?

STEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.

LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!

STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.

LYNCH Ba!

STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.

LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?

STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.

(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)

LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.

(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.

Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.

At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)

BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!

(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)

BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?

(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)

BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.

(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)

BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.

(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)

THE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)

THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.

BLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.

(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)

THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.

(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)

THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?

BLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!

(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)

BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta?

THE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.

BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.

(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)

BLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)

BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.

(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)

BLOOM O!

(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)

BLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.

(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)

RUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.

BLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.

RUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?

BLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.

RUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?

BLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.

RUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.

BLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.

RUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!

BLOOM Mamma!

ELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?

(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)

A VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!

BLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.

(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)

BLOOM Molly!

MARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?

BLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.

(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)

MARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.

(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)

BLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...

MARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.

BLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!

(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)

THE SOAP

We're a capital couple are Bloom and I;
He brightens the earth, I polish the sky.


(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)

SWENY Three and a penny, please.

BLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.

MARION (Softly.) Poldy!

BLOOM Yes, ma'am?

MARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?

(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)

BLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...

(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)

THE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.

(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)

BRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?

(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)

THE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.

(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)

GERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.

BLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.

THE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.

GERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.

(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)

MRS BREEN Mr.

BLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .

MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!

BLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...

MRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

BLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.

(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)

There's someone in the house with Dina
There's someone in the house, I know,
There's someone in the house with Dina
Playing on the old banjo.


(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)

BLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?

MRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!

BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.

MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.

BLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?

MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.

BLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.

MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.

BLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.

MRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.

BLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) Là ci darem la mano.

MRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.

BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)

ALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.

MRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.

BLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?

MRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?

BLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.

(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)

RICHIE Best value in Dub.

(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)

PAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.

RICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...

(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)

RICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!

BLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.

MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.

BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.

MRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.

BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?

MRS BREEN Let's.

(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)

THE BAWD Jewman's melt!

BLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?

MRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.

BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...

MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!

BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.

MRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.

BLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .

MRS BREEN Too.

BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .

MRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)

THE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.

THE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!

(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)

BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.

THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.

(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)

THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.

(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)

THE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?

THE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.

THE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!

PRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.

PRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!

PRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.

THE NAVVY (Shouts.)

We are the boys. Of Wexford.

PRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?

PRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.

THENAVVY (Shouts.)

The galling chain.
And free our native land.


(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)

BLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.

(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)

Odd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)

THE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.

BLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son goût. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.

(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)

THE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.

(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)

FIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.

BLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.

(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)

THE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.

BLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.

(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)

BOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.

(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)

SECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.

BLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.

(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)

SIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.

FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.

BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.

FIRST WATCH Proof.

(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)

BLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.

FIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.

SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.

BLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.

(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)

THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.

MARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.

FIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.

BLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.

MARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.

BLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.

SECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.

BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.

FIRST WATCH Regiment.

BLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.

A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?

BLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.

FIRST WATCH Profession or trade.

BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...

(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)

MYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?

(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)

BEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.

BLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?

BEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.

BLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.

BEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.

A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY

Moses, Moses, king of the jews,
Wiped his arse in the Daily News.


BLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.

BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.

BLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.

FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.

THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!

(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)

SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?

MARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.

FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?

MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.

BLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.

MARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!

FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?

MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.

BLOOM She counterassaulted.

MARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!

(General laughter.)

GEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.

(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )

(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)

LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.

PROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.

(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)

(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.

BLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)

Li li poo lil chile,
Blingee pigfoot evly night.
Payee two shilly...


(He is howled down.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.

BLOOM A penny in the pound.

(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)

DLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.

(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)

J. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)

BLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.

MRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!

(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)

THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!

SECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.

MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.

MRS BELLINGHAM Me too.

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.

(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.

BLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.

MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!

MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!

BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.

MRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.

BLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)

MRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!

THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?

BLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.

(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)

DAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.

(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)

THE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)

Cuckoo
Cuckoo
Cuckoo


(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)

THE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.

(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)

THE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.

THE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?

THE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.

THE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.

FIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.

SECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.

THE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.

(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)

THE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)

(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)

LONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?

(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)

RUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.

(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)

THE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!

BLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .

HYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.

SECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!

(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)

PADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.

(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)

BLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?

PADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!

BLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.

SECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?

FIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.

PADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.

A VOICE O rocks.

PADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.

(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)

FATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.

(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.

PADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.

(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!

JOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.

(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)

PADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.

(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)

TOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.

(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)

THE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!

(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)

BLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.

(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)

ZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.

BLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?

ZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?

BLOOM Not I!

ZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?

(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)

ZOE How's the nuts?

BLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.

ZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.

BLOOM Not likely.

ZOE I feel it.

(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)

BLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.

ZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?

(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)

ZOE You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.

(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)

ZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.

BLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.

ZOE And you know what thought did?

(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)

BLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?

ZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?

BLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.

ZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.

BLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!

(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)

THE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!

BLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...

AN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!

(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)

THE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!

(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)

LATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.

COUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.

BLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...

(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)

BLOOM'S BOYS

The wren, the wren,
The king of all birds,
Saint Stephen's his day,
Was caught in the furze.


A BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.

A PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!

(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)

A MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?

A NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!

A FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!

A BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.

(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)

THE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!

ALL God save Leopold the First!

BLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.

WILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?

BLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.

MICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!

(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)

THE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.

(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)

BLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.

(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)

JOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!

BLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.

(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)

TOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.

BLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.

THE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!

JOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.

A BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!

AN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.

AN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.

BLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.

(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)

THE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)

(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)

THE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.

BLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!

(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth? (historic), Expel that Pain (medic), Infant's Compendium of the Universe (cosmic), Let's All Chortle (hilaric), Canvasser's Vade Mecum (journalic), love-letters of Mother Assistant (erotic), Who's Who in Space (astric), Songs that Reached Our Heart (melodic), Pennywise's Way to Wealth (parsimonic). A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)

THE WOMEN Little father! Little father!

THE BABES AND SUCKLINGS

Clap clap hands till Poldy comes home,
Cakes in his pocket for Leo alone.


(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)


BABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.


BLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends! (He plays pussy fourcorners with ragged boys and girls.) Peep! Bopeep! (He wheels twins in a perambulator.) Ticktacktwo wouldyousetashoe? (He performs juggler's tricks, draws red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet silk handkerchiefs from his mouth.) Roygbiv. 32 feet per second. (He consoles a widow.) Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!


THE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!


(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)


BLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.


(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)


JIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open. His Most Catholic Majesty will now administer open air justice. Free medical and legal advice, solution of doubles and other problems. All cordially invited. Given at this our loyal city of Dublin in the year I of the Paradisiacal Era.


PADDY LEONARD What am I to do about my rates and taxes?


BLOOM Pay them, my friend.


PADDY LEONARD Thank you.


NOSEY FLYNN Can I raise a mortgage on my fire insurance?


BLOOM (Obdurately.) Sirs, take notice that by the law of torts you are bound over in your own recognisances for six months in the sum of five pounds.


J.J. O'MOLLY A Daniel did I say? Nay! A Peter O'Brien!


NOSEY FLYNN Where do I draw the five pounds?

CHRIS CALLINAN What is the parallax of the subsolar ecliptic of Aldebaran?

BLOOM Pleased to hear from you, Chris. K. II.

JOE HYNES Why aren't you in uniform?

BLOOM When my progenitor of sainted memory wore the uniform of the Austrian despot in a dank prison where was yours?

BEN DOLLARD Pansies?

BLOOM Embellish (beautify) suburban gardens.

BEN DOLLARD When twins arrive?

BLOOM Father (pater, dad) starts thinking.

LARRY O'ROURKE An eight day licence for my new premises. You remember me, sir Leo, when you were in number seven. I'm sending around a dozen of stout for the missus.

BLOOM (Coldly.) You have the advantage of me. Lady Bloom accepts no presents.

CROFTON This is indeed a festivity.

BLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.

ALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?

BLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.

O'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.

DAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!

BLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.

LENEHAN What about mixed bathing?

(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)

FATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.

MRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!

MOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!

NOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom. One of the old sweet songs.

BLOOM (With rollicking humour.)

I vowed that I never would leave her,
She turned out a cruel deceiver.
With my tooraloom tooraloom tooralcom tooraloom.


HOPPY HOLOHAN Good old Bloom! There's nobody like him after all.

PADDY LEONARD Stage Irishman!

BLOOM What railway opera is like a tramline in Gibraltar? The Rows of Casteele. (Laughter.)

LENEHAN Plagiarist! Down with Bloom!

THE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.

BLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.

THEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.

THE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)

(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)

ALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!

THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!

(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)

BLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.

DR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.

(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)

DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.

DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.

DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.

DR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.

(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)

BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.

MRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.

(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindorée, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)

A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?

BLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.

BROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.

BANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.

(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)

A DEADHAND (Writes on the wall.) Bloom is a cod. A CRAB (In bush ranger's kit.) What did you do in the cattlecreep behind Kilbarrack?

A FEMALE INFANT (Shakes a rattle.) And under Ballybough bridge?

A HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?

BLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.

THE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!

(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)

THE ARTANE ORPHANS

You big, you bog, you dirty dog!
You think the ladies love you!


THE PRISON GATE GIRLS

If you see kay
Tell him he may
See you in tea
Tell him from me.


HORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.

(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)

MASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!

(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)

MESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.

BLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!

(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)

REUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.

THE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!

BROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.

(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)

THE CITIZEN Thank heaven!

BLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.

(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)

THE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us. Music without Words, pray for us. Reprover of the Citizen, pray for us. Friend of all Frillies, pray for us. Midwife Most Merciful, pray for us. Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.

(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)

ZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.

BLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.

ZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.

BLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.

ZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.

BLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?

ZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?

BLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.

ZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.

BLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.

ZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.

BLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.

ZOE Babby!

BLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.

THE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.

ZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.

(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)

THE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!

(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)

ZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.

BLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.

ZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.

(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)

KITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!

ZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)

KITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?

LYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.

ZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.

(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)

KITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!

ZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.

(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)

STEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?

THE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!

STEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!

THE CAP Bah!

STEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .

THE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.

STEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.

THE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)

STEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!

LYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?

ZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.

(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)

FLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.

KITTY No!

ZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!

FLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.

(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)

THE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.

(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)

STEPHEN A time, times and half a time.

(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)

ALL What?

THE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)

FLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!

(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)

THE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...

(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)

THE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?

(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)

ELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps. (He shouts.) Now then our glory song. All join heartily in the singing. Encore! (He sings.) Jeru...

THE GRAMOPHONE (Drowning his voice.) Whorusalaminyour highhohhhh.

(The disc rasps gratingly against the needle.)

THE THREE' WHORES (Covering their ears, squawk.) Ahhkkk!

ELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.

KITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.

ZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.

FLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.

STEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.

(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)

THE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.

LYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.

(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)

BEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.

(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)

MANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.

(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)

THE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!

(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)

ZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?

LYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.

ZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?

LYNCH I'm not looking.

ZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?

(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)

VIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.

BLOOM Granpapachi. But...

VIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?

BLOOM She is rather lean.

VIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!

BLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.

VIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.

BLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.

VIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...

BLOOM With?...

VIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.

BLOOM The stye I dislike.

VIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.

(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.

BLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .

VIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa è santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.

BLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?

VIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!

(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)

BLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.

VIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!

BLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...

VIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.

BLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.

VIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...

BLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.

VIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.

I'm a tiny tiny thing
Ever flying in the spring
Round and round a ringaring.
Long ago I was a king,
Now I do this kind of thing
On the wing, on the wing!
Bing!


(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.

(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)

HENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.

(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)

STEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.

(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)

ARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.

FLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.

STEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?

FLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.

(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)

PHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.

PHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?

(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?

FLORRY And the song?

STEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.

FLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.

STEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.

PHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.

ZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.

VIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!

LYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.

ZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.

BLOOM Poor man!

ZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.

BLOOM How?

VIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.

KITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.

PHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?

PHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'était le sacré pigeon, Philippe.

(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)

LYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.

FLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.

ZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.

LYNCH Three wise virgins.

VIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!

(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)

BEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.

(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)

THE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!

A VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.

BEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.

HENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.

VIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!

(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)

THE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.

HENRY All is lost now.

(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)

VIRAG'S HEAD Quack!

(Exeunt severally.)

STEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.

LYNCH All one and the same God to her.

STEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.

FLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.

LYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.

STEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.

(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)

THE CARDINAL

Conservio lies captured.
He lies in the lowest dungeon
With manacles and chains around his limbs
Weighing upwards of three tons.


(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.

(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.

(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.

(The trick doorhandle turns.)

THE DOORHANDLE Theeee.

ZOE The devil is in that door.

(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)

ZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.

BLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?

ZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.

(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)

KITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.

BLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.

(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)

BLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.

ZOE Do as you're bid. Here.

(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)

BLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.

(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)

BELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.

(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)

THE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.

BLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .

THE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.

BLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.

THE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?

BLOOM Yes. No.

THE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)

BLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.

THE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.

BLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!

RICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.

THE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.

BLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.

THE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.

BLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.

THE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.

BLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!

(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)

BLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.

THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.

BLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?

THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.

BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!

(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)

BLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.

BELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!

BLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!

BELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!

BLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!

BELLO Dungdevourer!

BLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.

BELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!

BLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!

(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)

BELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.

BLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.

BELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.

(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.

ZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.

BLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.

FLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.

KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.

BELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.

BLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.

BELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.

(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)

BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!

BELLO (Twisting.) Another!

BLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!

BELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)

BLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...

BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.

ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.

FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.

KITTY No, me. Lend him to me.

(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)

MRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)

BELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?

BLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!

BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.

FLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.

ZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?

BLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.

BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.

BLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.

BELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.

BLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?

BELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...

BLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.

BELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?

BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.

BELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?

BLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.

BELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.

BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.

BELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.

THE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?

BELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.

(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )

BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...

BELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !

BLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...

BELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.

BLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!

(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)

BELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.

BLOOM Thank you, mistress.

BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!

A BIDDER A florin!

(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)

A VOICE One and eightpence too much.

THE LACQUEY Barang!

CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.

BELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?

A DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.

VOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.

BELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.

BLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.

BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?

BLOOM Eccles Street.

BELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!

BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.

BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.

BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...

BELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.

(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)

SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!

BLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.

BELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.

(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)

MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!

BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.

BLOOM They... I

BELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.

BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...

A VOICE Swear!

(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)

BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.

BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?

(He bites his thumb.)

BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!

BLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)

BELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)

THE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.

VOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.

(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)

THE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!

BLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.

THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.

BLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.

THE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.

BLOOM You mean Photo Bits?

THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.

BLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.

THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.

BLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.

THE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.

BLOOM You understood them?

THE YEWS Ssh.

THE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?

BLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.

THE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!

BLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.

(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.

JOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!

THE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?

BLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.

(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)

THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!

(They cheer.)

BLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!

THE ECHO Fool!

THE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?

THE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?

THE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.

THE WATERFALL

Poulaphouca Poulaphouca
Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.


THE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!

BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?

(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)

STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.

BLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.

(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)

THE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!

BLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)

THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?

(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)

COUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...

BLOOM Done. Prff.

THE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?

BLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.

THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.

BLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?

(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)

THE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.

THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.

(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)

THE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!

THE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.

THE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!

BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.

THE WATERFALL

Phillaphulla Poulaphouca
Poulaphouca Poulaphouca.


THE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!

THE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.

(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)

THE BUTTON Bip!

(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)

THE SLUTS

O Leopold lost the pin of his drawers
He didn't know what to do,
To keep it up,
To keep it up.


BLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.

THE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!

THE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!

BLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?

THE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !

BLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.

(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)

BELLA You'll know me the next time.

BLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Passée. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.

BELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!

BLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.

BELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!

BLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!

BELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?

ZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.

(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)

BLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.

BLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.

ZOE

Give a thing and take it back
God'll ask you where is that
You'll say you don't know
God'll send you down below.


BLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.

STEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.

ZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.

BELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?

(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)

STEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel où tenons nostre état.

LYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.

STEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.

BELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.

STEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.

(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)

FLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)

BELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.

STEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.

ZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.

LYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!

KITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)

FLORRY And me?

LYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)

STEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.

BLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.

BELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.

ZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)

BLOOM This is yours.

STEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.

BLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.

STEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.

BLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?

STEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.

BLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.

STEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.

BLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.

STEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.

BLOOM No, but...

STEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)

LYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.

STEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.

ZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.

FLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.

STEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.

LYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)

BLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?

ZOE Is he hungry?

STEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)

Hangende Hunger,
Fragende Frau,
Macht uns alle kaput.


ZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.

LYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?

ZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)

LYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.

(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)

FATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.

(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)

DON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.

ZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.

STEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.

ZOE What day were you born?

STEPHEN Thursday. Today.

ZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.

FLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.

ZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?

BLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.

BELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.

ZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.

BLOOM Wrong.

ZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?

(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)

BLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.

(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)

BLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.

ZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.

STEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?

(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)

FLORRY What?

(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)

THE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?

(Bronze by gold they whisper.)

ZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.

(They whisper again.)

(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)

LENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?

BOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.

LENEHAN A good night's work.

BOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.

LENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!

ZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.

BOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?

BLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...

BOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?

BLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.

MARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.

BOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!

BELLA What? What is it?

(Zoe whispers to her.)

MARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.

BELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.

BOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.

BLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...

KITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.

(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)

MINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!

LYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.

KITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.

BOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!

MARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!

BLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!

BELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!

LYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.

(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)

SHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!

BLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?

ZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.

BLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...

(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)

FREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!

SUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!

SHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.

(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)

MRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.

MARTIN CUNNINGHAM

(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!

STEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.

BELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.

LYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.

ZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.

(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)

LYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.

STEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Perfectly shocking terrific of religion's things mockery seen in universal world. All chic womans which arrive full of modesty then disrobe and squeal loud to see vampire man debauch nun very fresh young with dessous troublants. (He clocks his tongue loudly.) Ho, la la! Ce pif qu'il a!

LYNCH Vive le vampire!

THE WHORES Bravo! Parleyvoo!

STEPHEN (Grimacing with head back, laughs loudly, clapping himself) Great success of laughing. Angels much prostitutes like and holy apostles big damn ruffians. Demimondaines nicely handsome sparkling of diamonds very amiable cos turned. Or do you are fond better what belongs they moderns pleasure turpitude of old mans? (He points about him with grotesque gestures which Lynch and the whores reply to.) Caoutchouc statue woman reversible or lifesize tompeeptoms virgins nudities very lesbic the kiss five ten times. Enter gentlemen to see in mirrors every positions trapezes all that machine there besides also if desire act awfully bestial butcher's boy pollutes in warm veal liver or omelette on the belly pièce de Shakespeare.

BELLA (Clapping her belly, sinks back on the sofa with a shout of laughter.) An omelette on the... Ho! ho! ho! ho!... Omelette on the...

STEPHEN (Mincingly.) I love you, Sir darling. Speak you englishman tongue for double entente cordiale. O yes, mon loup. How much cost? Waterloo. Watercloset. (He ceases suddenly and holds up a forefinger.)

BELLA (Laughing.) Omelette...

THE WHORES (Laughing.) Encore! Encore!

STEPHEN Mark me. I dreamt of a watermelon.

ZOE Go abroad and love a foreign lady.

LYNCH Across the world for a wife.

FLORRY Dreams go by contraries.

STEPHEN (Extending his arms.) It was here. Street of harlots. In Serpentine Avenue Beelzebub showed me her, a fubsy widow. Where's the red carpet spread?

BLOOM (Approaching Stephen.) Look.

STEPHEN No, I flew. My foes beneath me. And ever shall be. World without end. (He cries.) Pater! Free!

BLOOM I say, look...

STEPHEN Break my spirit, will he? O merde alors! (He cries, his vulture talons sharpened.) Hola! Hillyho!

(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)

SIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!

(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)

THE CROWD

Card of the races. Racing card!
Ten to one the field!
Tommy on the clay here!
Tommy on the clay!
Ten to one bar one.
Ten to one bar one.
Try your luck on spinning Jenny!
Ten to one bar one!
Sell the monkey, boys!
Sell the monkey!
I'll give ten to one!
Ten to one bar one!


(A dark horse, riderless, bolts like a phantom past the winningpost, his mane moonfoaming, his eyeballs stars. The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)

THE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!

GARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!

(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)

THE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John! Soft day, your honour!

(Private Carr, Private Compton and Cissy Caffrey pass beneath the windows, singing in discord.)

STEPHEN Hark! Our friend, noise in the street!

ZOE (Holds up her hand.) Stop!

PRIVATE CARR, PRIVATE COMPTON and CISSY CAFFREY

Yet I've a sort a
Yorkshire relish for...


ZOE That's me. (She claps her hands.) Dance! Dance! (She runs to the pianola.) Who has twopence?

BLOOM Who'll.

LYNCH (Handing her coins.) Here.

STEPHEN (Cracking his fingers impatiently.) Quick! Quick! Where's my augur's rod? (He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)

ZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.

(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)

ZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?

(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)

MAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! Révérence! Tout le monde en place!

(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)

THE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.

(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)

MAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carré! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!

(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)

HOURS You may touch my.

CAVALIERS May I touch your?

HOURS O, but lightly!

CAVALIERS O, so lightly!

THE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.

(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)

MAGINNI Avant! huit! Traversé! Salut! Cours de mains! Croisé!

(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)

THE BRACELETS Heigho! Heigho!

ZOE (Twisting, her hand to her brow.) O!

MAGINNI Los tiroirs! Chaîne de dames! La corbeille! Dos à dos!

(Arabesquing wearily, they weave a pattern on the floor, weaving, unweaving, curtseying, twisting, simply swirling.)

ZOE I'm giddy.

(She frees herself droops on a chair, Stephen seizes Florry and turns with her.)

MAGINNI Boulangère! Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!

(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements. Stephen and Florry turn cumbrously.)

MAGINNI Dansez avec vos dames! Changes de dames! Donnes le petit bouquet a votre dame! Remerciez!

THE PIANOLA

Best, best of all,
Baraabum!


KITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!

(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)

THE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

ZOE Yorkshire through and through. Come on all!

(She seizes Florry and waltzes her.)

STEPHEN Pas seul!

(He wheels Kitty into Lynch's arm's, snatches up his ashplant from the table and takes the floor. All wheel, whirl, waltz, twirl. Bloombella, Kittylynch, Florryzoe, jujuby women. Stephen with hat ashplant frogsplits in middle highkicks with skykicking mouth shut hand clasp part under thigh, with clang tinkle boomhammer tallyho horn blower blue green yellow flashes. Toft's cumbersome turns with hobbyhorse riders from gilded snakes dangled, bowels fandango leaping spurn soil foot and fall again.)

THE PIANOLA

Though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.


(Closeclutched swift swifter with glareblareflare scudding they scotlootshoot lumbering by. Baraabum!)

TUTTI Encore! Bis! Bravo! Encore!

SIMON Think of your mother's people!

STEPHEN Dance of death.

(Bang fresh barang bang of lacquey's bell, horse, nag, steer piglings, Conmee on Christass lame crutch and leg sailor in cockboat armfolded ropepulling hitching stamp hornpipe' through and through, Baraabum! On nags, hogs, bellhorses, Gadarene swine, Corny in coffin. Steel shark stone one handled Nelson, two trickies Frauenzimmer plumstained from pram falling bawling. Gum, he's a champion. Fuseblue peer from barrel rev. evensong love on hackney jaunt Blazes blind coddoubled bicyclers Dilly with snowcake no fancy clothes. Then in last wiswitchback lumbering up and down bump mash tub sort of viceroy and reine relish for tublumber bumpshire rose. Baraabum!)

(The couples fall aside. Stephen whirls giddily. Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)

STEPHEN Ho!

(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)

THE CHOIR

Liliata rutilantium te confessorum...
Iubilantium te virginum...


(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)


BUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.


THE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.


STEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?


BUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.


THE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.


STEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.


THE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.


STEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.


THE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.


STEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!


THE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.


ZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!


FLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look! He's white.


BLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.


THE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!


STEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!


THE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)


STEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)


BLOOM (At the window.) What?


STEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!


FLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)


THE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!


STEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!


THE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.


STEPHEN Nothung!


(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)


THE GASJET Pwfungg!


BLOOM Stop!


LYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!


BELLA Police!


(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)
BELLA (Screams.) After him!


(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)


THE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.


ZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.


BELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.


BLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?


A WHORE He tore his coat.


BELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.


BLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...


BELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.


BLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...


BELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!


BLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!


FLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?


BELLA Do you want me to call the police?


BLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.


BELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!


BLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.


BELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?


ZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.


BLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

THE HUE AND CRY (Helterskelterelterwelter) He's Bloom! Stop Bloom! Stopabloom! Stopperrobber! Hi! Hi! Stop him on the corner!


(At the corner of Beaver Street beneath the scaffolding Bloom panting stops on the fringe of the noisy quarrelling knot, a lot not knowing a jot what hi! hi! row and wrangle round the whowhat brawlaltogether.)


STEPHEN (With elaborate gestures, breathing deeply and slowly.) You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?


STEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.
VOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.


CISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.


STEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.


VOICES She's faithfultheman.


CISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.


PRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.


PRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?


LORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.


PRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.


STEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.


CISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.


STEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...


PRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?


STEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.


(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?


DOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.


(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)


BLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.


STEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.


(He staggers a pace back.)


BLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.


STEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.


BIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.


CUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.


BIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.


CUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.


PRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?


(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: Défense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.


(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)


PRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.


STEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!


EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)


My methods are new and are causing surprise.
To make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.


STEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...

PRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.

BLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.

STEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.

PRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.

STEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.

(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)

KEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.

(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)

PATRICE Socialiste!

DON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!

BLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.

STEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.

BIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.

THE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.

THE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!

A ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.

THE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)

May the God above
Send down a cove
With teeth as sharp as razors
To slit the throat
Of the English dogs
That hanged our Irish leaders.


THE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)

I bear no hate to a living thing,
But love my country beyond the king.


RUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.

(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)

THE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.

(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)

RUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!

EDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)

On coronation day, on coronation day,
O, Won't We have a merry time,
Drinking whisky, beer and wine!


PRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?

STEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.

PRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?

STEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? ça se voit aussi à Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...

(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)

STEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?

STEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.

CISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!

A ROUGH Our men retreated.

PRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.

BLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.

THE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!

(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)

PRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.

STEPHEN Did I? When?

BLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.

THE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!

(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.

PRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.

PRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.

(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)

CISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!

CUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.

BIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.

CUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!

STEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.

PRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.

BLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.

CISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!

STEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)

White thy fambles, red thy gan
And thy quarrons dainty is.


VOICES Police!

DISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!

(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.

FATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.

THE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.

THE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Dooooooooooog!

THE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!

(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)

ADONAI Goooooooooood!

(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)

PRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!

OLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!

BLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?

LYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)

STEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.

BLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.

STEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.

CISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.

BLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.

PRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.

(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)

MAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!

THE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.

THE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!

(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)

What call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!

THE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.

(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)

THE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.

BLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!

PRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!

(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)

FIRST WATCH What's wrong here?

PRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?

CISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?

A MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.

BLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...

SECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?

PRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.

BLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.

SECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.

PRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.

FIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?

BLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.

FIRST WATCH Name and address.

(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)

BLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.

SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

CORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?

FIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.

(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)

CORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?

FIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.

CORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?

SECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.

CORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.

SECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.

CORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.

BLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.

FIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.

SECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.

FIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.

BLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.

SECOND WATCH It's our duty.

CORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.

THE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)

BLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.

BLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...

CORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!

BLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...

(The horse neighs.)

THE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!

CORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?

BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.

(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)

CORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.

BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.

CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!

THE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.

BLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...

(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)

CORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.

BLOOM Night.

(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)

BLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!

STEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...

(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)

BLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!

(Murmurs.)

... shadows... the woods
... white breast... dim...


(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)

BLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...

(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)

BLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!

RUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"

[Verse 1]
You're all so weak you follow heel and toe
One shepherd to herd the cattle to my throne
Crafted bullshit from the mind of a deluded fool
Millennia have passed yet it remains illogical

A book of lies changed again and again
It told of a great king
It told of endless pain
Forcing the worship of man made currency
Burning knowledge raping collective rationality
Drenched in hypocrisy

It made the world believe
You were created for a purpose
In His image
Protected by His love
Forever watched over
From the heavens above

Your species' freedom was stripped long ago
You are divided, misguided;
There will never come your time
You've missed your chance to rise

Yesterday you were men of ""God""
Now you grovel before me
Begging not to spill your blood

[Verse 2]

Programmed to stick to a linear path
Content to pick at bones force fed synthetic filth

Welcome to hell on earth
The blood of heretics shall feed the birth
Of Dis; the city of evil will rise
To punish these mortals for their lies
One by one forced through the gates
Brought before my wrath to consecrate
Complete control of all mortal fate
I stand above all of creation
They will suffer within my hands
To sustain my undead life I will bathe in the blood of every maggot infested usurper and traitor
Then drain their essence to further the pureness of my true form
The bodies are added to my throne
Hollow and soulless unable to die
From under their flesh more will grow
Forsaken to inhere in my mortuary
The woeful and vile are the foundations of my door to the Promised Land

This is the day subservience will cease to exist
When humanity calls what once was my name
I will not return to be their slave
No longer able to succumb to the story-telling of Man
The need for dependence is amiss
As the world’s deities lay to rest in the deepest graves
Humankind remains oblivious to the price paid
And the reason it must be this way
Focus on my voice for I will only say this once
Your weakness leads to desire for a higher source
You worship the Sun; transform it - believe and become numb
Always, you must follow this mindless herd into darkness
Never to find a way of your own, forever kneeling before material thrones

If you are to have any hope know the divine comes only from your mindYou might also likeEmbed"

Final catch and throw back before today
There's one more thing I'd like to say
Take it from me... lost my heart
Take it from me... my barren soul
Take it from me... you tear it apart
I know exactly what you are

Faith, so blinded by white fears
Words falling on deaf ears
Your sympathy's nothing I need
Flesh and bone and stars watch you fall and sink

It’s that type of off season
Take me out of my feelings

Don’t wanna diss, but at least I hit that
Hate when you talk, I don’t run for the chit chat
Fuck that bitch, Wanna get my shit back

Now that I’m back, I’m squashing this pawn
Wе come and attack 'em, we coming to Swarm
You opеn my portal, I’m raging like spawn
Now can I speak
I’m sick of your lying, your dumber then weak
Eighty percent true, the twenty is sweet
It might be a hunnid if your six feet deep
Oops, I said that, ain’t that cheap

Mr. Lincoln's Reply

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:—I have been somewhat, in my own mind, complimented by a large portion of Judge Douglas's speech,—I mean that portion which he devotes to the controversy between himself and the present Administration. This is the seventh time Judge Douglas and myself have met in these joint discussions, and he has been gradually improving in regard to his war with the Administration. At Quincy, day before yesterday, he was a little more severe upon the Administration than I had heard him upon any occasion, and I took pains to compliment him for it. I then told him to give it to them with all the power he had; and as some of them were present, I told them I would be very much obliged if they would give it to him in about the same way. I take it he has now vastly improved upon the attack he made then upon the Administration. I flatter myself he has really taken my advice on this subject. All I can say now is to re-commend to him and to them what I then commended,—to prosecute the war against one another in the most vigorous manner. I say to them again: ""Go it, husband!—Go it, bear!""

There is one other thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the discussion,—although I do not consider it much of my business, anyway. I refer to that part of the Judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency. He reads something from Mr. Buchanan, from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency; and he gets something of a cheer for having done so. I would only remind the Judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise. I want to know if Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has Douglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all questions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself? Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject?

So far as Judge Douglas addressed his speech to me, or so far as it was about me, it is my business to pay some attention to it. I have heard the Judge state two or three times what he has stated to-day, that in a speech which I made at Springfield, Illinois, I had in a very especial manner complained that the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case had decided that a negro could never be a citizen of the United States. I have omitted by some accident heretofore to analyze this statement, and it is required of me to notice it now. In point of fact it is untrue. I never have complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it held that a negro could not be a citizen, and the Judge is always wrong when he says I ever did so complain of it. I have the speech here, and I will thank him or any of his friends to show where I said that a negro should be a citizen, and complained especially of the Dred Scott decision because it declared he could not be one. I have done no such thing; and Judge Douglas, so persistently insisting that I have done so, has strongly impressed me with the belief of a predetermination on his part to misrepresent me. He could not get his foundation for insisting that I was in favor of this negro equality anywhere else as well as he could by assuming that untrue proposition. Let me tell this audience what is true in regard to that matter; and the means by which they may correct me if I do not tell them truly is by a recurrence to the speech itself. I spoke of the Dred Scott decision in my Springfield speech, and I was then endeavoring to prove that the Dred Scott decision was a portion of a system or scheme to make slavery national in this country. I pointed out what things had been decided by the court. I mentioned as a fact that they had decided that a negro could not be a citizen; that they had done so, as I supposed, to deprive the negro, under all circumstances, of the remotest possibility of ever becoming a citizen and claiming the rights of a citizen of the United States under a certain clause of the Constitution. I stated that, without making any complaint of it at all. I then went on and stated the other points decided in the case; namely, that the bringing of a negro into the State of Illinois and holding him in slavery for two years here was a matter in regard to which they would not decide whether it would make him free or not; that they decided the further point that taking him into a United States Territory where slavery was prohibited by Act of Congress did not make him free, because that Act of Congress, as they held, was unconstitutional. I mentioned these three things as making up the points decided in that case. I mentioned them in a lump, taken in connection with the introduction of the Nebraska Bill, and the amendment of Chase, offered at the time, declaratory of the right of the people of the Territories to exclude slavery, which was voted down by the friends of the bill. I mentioned all these things together, as evidence tending to prove a combination and conspiracy to make the institution of slavery national. In that connection and in that way I mentioned the decision on the point that a negro could not be a citizen, and in no other connection.

Out of this Judge Douglas builds up his beautiful fabrication of my purpose to introduce a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races. His assertion that I made an ""especial objection"" (that is his exact language) to the decision on this account is untrue in point of fact.
Now, while I am upon this subject, and as Henry Clay has been alluded to, I desire to place myself, in connection with Mr. Clay, as nearly right before this people as may be. I am quite aware what the Judge's object is here by all these allusions. He knows that we are before an audience having strong sympathies southward, by relationship, place of birth, and so on. He desires to place me in an extremely Abolition attitude. He read upon a former occasion, and alludes, without reading, to-day to a portion of a speech which I delivered in Chicago. In his quotations from that speech, as he has made them upon former occasions, the extracts were taken in such a way as, I suppose, brings them within the definition of what is called garbling,—taking portions of a speech which, when taken by themselves, do not present the entire sense of the speaker as expressed at the time. I propose, therefore, out of that same speech, to show how one portion of it which he skipped over (taking an extract before and an extract after) will give a different idea, and the true idea I intended to convey. It will take me some little time to read it, but I believe I will occupy the time that way.

You have heard him frequently allude to my controversy with him in regard to the Declaration of Independence. I confess that I have had a struggle with Judge Douglas on that matter, and I will try briefly to place myself right in regard to it on this occasion. I said—and it is between the extracts Judge Douglas has taken from this speech, and put in his published speeches:

""It may be argued that there are certain conditions that make necessities and impose them upon us, and to the extent that a necessity is imposed upon a man he must submit to it. I think that was the condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government. We had slaves among us, we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery, we could not secure the good we did secure if we grasped for more; and having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let the charter remain as our standard.""

Now, I have upon all occasions declared as strongly as Judge Douglas against the disposition to interfere with the existing institution of slavery. You hear me read it from the same speech from which he takes garbled extracts for the purpose of proving upon me a disposition to interfere with the institution of slavery, and establish a perfect social and political equality between negroes and white people.
Allow me while upon this subject briefly to present one other extract from a speech of mine, more than a year ago, at Springfield, in discussing this very same question, soon after Judge Douglas took his ground that negroes were, not included in the Declaration of Independence:

""I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all men were equal in color, size, intellect, moral development, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal,—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This they said, and this they meant. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality, or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. In fact they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the right, so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit.

""They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all,—constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.""

There again are the sentiments I have expressed in regard to the Declaration of Independence upon a former occasion,—sentiments which have been put in print and read wherever anybody cared to know what so humble an individual as myself chose to say in regard to it.

At Galesburgh, the other day, I said, in answer to Judge Douglas, that three years ago there never had been a man, so far as I knew or believed, in the whole world, who had said that the Declaration of Independence did not include negroes in the term ""all men."" I reassert it to-day. I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may search the whole records of the country, and it will be a matter of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the astounding sentiment that the term ""all men"" in the Declaration did not include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood. I know that more than three years ago there were men who, finding this assertion constantly in the way of their schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of slavery, denied the truth of it. I know that Mr. Calhoun and all the politicians of his school denied the truth of the Declaration. I know that it ran along in the mouth of some Southern men for a period of years, ending at last in that shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of Pettit of Indiana, upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the Declaration of Independence was in that respect ""a self-evident lie,"" rather than a self-evident truth. But I say, with a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the Declaration without directly attacking it, that three years ago there never had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking way of pretending to believe it, and then asserting it did not include the negro. I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case, and the next to him was our friend Stephen A. Douglas. And now it has become the catchword of the entire party. I would like to call upon his friends everywhere to consider how they have come in so short a time to view this matter in a way so entirely different from their former belief; to ask whether they are not being borne along by an irresistible current,—whither, they know not.

In answer to my proposition at Galesburgh last week, I see that some man in Chicago has got up a letter, addressed to the Chicago Times, to show, as he professes, that somebody had said so before; and he signs himself ""An Old-Line Whig,"" if I remember correctly. In the first place, I would say he was not an old-line Whig. I am somewhat acquainted with old-line Whigs from the origin to the end of that party; I became pretty well acquainted with them, and I know they always had some sense, whatever else you could ascribe to them. I know there never was one who had not more sense than to try to show by the evidence he produces that some men had, prior to the time I named, said that negroes were not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration of Independence. What is the evidence he produces? I will bring forward his evidence, and let you see what he offers by way of showing that somebody more than three years ago had said negroes were not included in the Declaration. He brings forward part of a speech from Henry Clay,—the part of the speech of Henry Clay which I used to bring forward to prove precisely the contrary. I guess we are surrounded to some extent to-day by the old friends of Mr. Clay, and they will be glad to hear anything from that authority. While he was in Indiana a man presented a petition to liberate his negroes, and he (Mr. Clay) made a speech in answer to it, which I suppose he carefully wrote out himself and caused to be published. I have before me an extract from that speech which constitutes the evidence this pretended ""Old-Line Whig"" at Chicago brought forward to show that Mr. Clay did n't suppose the negro was included in the Declaration of Independence. Hear what Mr. Clay said:

""And what is the foundation of this appeal to me in Indiana to liberate the slaves under my care in Kentucky? It is a general declaration in the act announcing to the world the independence of the thirteen American colonies, that all men are created equal. Now, as an abstract principle, there is no doubt of the truth of that declaration; and it is desirable, in the original construction of society and in organized societies, to keep it in view as a great fundamental principle. But, then, I apprehend that in no society that ever did exist, or ever shall be formed, was or can the equality asserted among the members of the human race be practically enforced and carried out. There are portions, large portions, women, minors, insane, culprits, transient sojourners, that will always probably remain subject to the government of another portion of the community.

""That declaration, whatever may be the extent of its import, was made by the delegations of the thirteen States. In most of them slavery existed, and had long existed, and was established by law. It was introduced and forced upon the colonies by the paramount law of England. Do you believe that in making that declaration the States that concurred in it intended that it should be tortured into a virtual emancipation of all the slaves within their respective limits? Would Virginia and other Southern States have ever united in a declaration which was to be interpreted into an abolition of slavery among them? Did any one of the thirteen colonies entertain such a design or expectation? To impute such a secret and unavowed purpose, would be to charge a political fraud upon the noblest band of patriots that ever assembled in council,—a fraud upon the Confederacy of the Revolution; a fraud upon the union of those States whose Constitution not only recognized the lawfulness of slavery, but permitted the importation of slaves from Africa until the year 1808.""

This is the entire quotation brought forward to prove that somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro was not included in the term ""all men"" in the Declaration. How does it do so? In what way has it a tendency to prove that? Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases. He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; but he says it is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle. Let me read a few words more before I add some comments of my own. Mr. Clay says, a little further on:

""I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is, How can they be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements.""
Now, here in this same book, in this same speech, in this same extract, brought forward to prove that Mr. Clay held that the negro was not included in the Declaration of Independence, is no such statement on his part, but the declaration that it is a great fundamental truth which should be constantly kept in view in the organization of society and in societies already organized. But if I say a word about it; if I attempt, as Mr. Clay said all good men ought to do, to keep it in view; if, in this ""organized society,"" I ask to have the public eye turned upon it; if I ask, in relation to the organization of new Territories, that the public eye should be turned upon it, forthwith I am vilified as you hear me to-day. What have I done that I have not the license of Henry Clay's illustrious example here in doing? Have I done aught that I have not his authority for, while maintaining that in organizing new Territories and societies this fundamental principle should be regarded, and in organized society holding it up to the public view and recognizing what he recognized as the great principle of free government?

And when this new principle—this new proposition that no human being ever thought of three years ago—is brought forward, I combat it as having an evil tendency, if not an evil design. I combat it as having a tendency to dehumanize the negro, to take away from him the right of ever striving to be a man. I combat it as being one of the thousand things constantly done in these days to prepare the public mind to make property, and nothing but property, of the negro in all the States of this Union.
But there is a point that I wish, before leaving this part of the discussion, to ask attention to. I have read and I repeat the words of Henry Clay:

""I desire no concealment of my opinions in regard to the institution of slavery. I look upon it as a great evil, and deeply lament that we have derived it from the parental government and from our ancestors. I wish every slave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors. But here they are, and the question is, How can they be best dealt with? If a state of nature existed, and we were about to lay the foundations of society, no man would be more strongly opposed than I should be to incorporate the institution of slavery amongst its elements.""

The principle upon which I have insisted in this canvass is in relation to laying the foundations of new societies. I have never sought to apply these principles to the old States for the purpose of abolishing slavery in those States. It is nothing but a miserable perversion of what I have said, to assume that I have declared Missouri, or any other slave State, shall emancipate her slaves; I have proposed no such thing. But when Mr. Clay says that in laying the foundations of society in our Territories where it does not exist, he would be opposed to the introduction of slavery as an element, I insist that we have his warrant—his license—for insisting upon the exclusion of that element which he declared in such strong and emphatic language was most hurtful to him.

Judge Douglas has again referred to a Springfield speech in which I said ""a house divided against itself cannot stand."" The Judge has so often made the entire quotation from that speech that I can make it from memory. I used this language:

""We are now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation. Under the operation of this policy, that agitation has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented. In my opinion it will not cease until a crisis shall have been reached and passed. 'A house divided against itself cannot stand.' I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the house to fall, but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South.""

That extract and the sentiments expressed in it have been extremely offensive to Judge Douglas. He has warred upon them as Satan wars upon the Bible. His perversions upon it are endless. Here now are my views upon it in brief:

I said we were now far into the fifth year since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of putting an end to the slavery agitation. Is it not so? When that Nebraska Bill was brought forward four years ago last January, was it not for the ""avowed object"" of putting an end to the slavery agitation? We were to have no more agitation in Congress; it was all to be banished to the Territories. By the way, I will remark here that, as Judge Douglas is very fond of complimenting Mr. Crittenden in these days, Mr. Crittenden has said there was a falsehood in that whole business, for there was no slavery agitation at that time to allay. We were for a little while quiet on the troublesome thing, and that very allaying plaster of Judge Douglas's stirred it up again. But was it not understood or intimated with the ""confident promise"" of putting an end to the slavery agitation? Surely it was. In every speech you heard Judge Douglas make, until he got into this ""imbroglio,"" as they call it, with the Administration about the Lecompton Constitution, every speech on that Nebraska Bill was full of his felicitations that we were just at the end of the slavery agitation. The last tip of the last joint of the old serpent's tail was just drawing out of view. But has it proved so? I have asserted that under that policy that agitation ""has not only not ceased, but has constantly augmented."" When was there ever a greater agitation in Congress than last winter? When was it as great in the country as to-day?

There was a collateral object in the introduction of that Nebraska policy, which was to clothe the people of the Territories with a superior degree of self-government, beyond what they had ever had before. The first object and the main one of conferring upon the people a higher degree of ""self-government"" is a question of fact to be determined by you in answer to a single question. Have you ever heard or known of a people anywhere on earth who had as little to do as, in the first instance of its use, the people of Kansas had with this same right of ""self-government ""? In its main policy and in its collateral object, it has been nothing but a living, creeping lie from the time of its introduction till to-day.

I have intimated that I thought the agitation would not cease until a crisis should have been reached and passed. I have stated in what way I thought it would be reached and passed. I have said that it might go one way or the other. We might, by arresting the further spread of it, and placing it where the fathers originally placed it, put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. Thus the agitation may cease. It may be pushed forward until it shall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North as well as South. I have said, and I repeat, my wish is that the further spread of it may be arrested, and that it may be where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction—I have expressed that as my wish I entertain the opinion, upon evidence sufficient to my mind, that the fathers of this government placed that institution where the public mind did rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction. Let me ask why they made provision that the source of slavery—the African slave-trade—should be cut off at the end of twenty years? Why did they make provision that in all the new territory we owned at that time slavery should be forever inhibited? Why stop its spread in one direction, and cut off its source in another, if they did not look to its being placed in the course of its ultimate extinction?

Again: the institution of slavery is only mentioned in the Constitution of the United States two or three times, and in neither of these cases does the word ""slavery"" or ""negro race"" occur; but covert language is used each time, and for a purpose full of significance. What is the language in regard to the prohibition of the African slave-trade? It runs in about this way:

""The migration or importation of such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight.""

The next allusion in the Constitution to the question of slavery and the black race is on the subject of the basis of representation, and there the language used is:
""Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all other persons.""

It says ""persons,"" not slaves, not negroes; but this ""three-fifths"" can be applied to no other class among us than the negroes.

Lastly, in the provision for the reclamation of fugitive slaves, it is said:

""No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.""
There again there is no mention of the word ""negro"" or of slavery. In all three of these places, being the only allusions to slavery in the instrument, covert language is used. Language is used not suggesting that slavery existed or that the black race were among us. And I understand the contemporaneous history of those times to be that covert language was used with a purpose, and that purpose was that in our Constitution, which it was hoped and is still hoped will endure forever,—when it should be read by intelligent and patriotic men, after the institution of slavery had passed from among us,—there should be nothing on the face of the great charter of liberty suggesting that such a thing as negro slavery had ever existed among us. This is part of the evidence that the fathers of the government expected and intended the institution of slavery to come to an end. They expected and intended that it should be in the course of ultimate extinction. And when I say that I desire to see the further spread of it arrested, I only say I desire to see that done which the fathers have first done. When I say I desire to see it placed where the public mind will rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction, I only say I desire to see it placed where they placed it. It is not true that our fathers, as Judge Douglas assumes, made this government part slave and part free. Understand the sense in which he puts it. He assumes that slavery is a rightful thing within itself,—was introduced by the framers of the Constitution. The exact truth is, that they found the institution existing among us, and they left it as they found it. But in making the government they left this institution with many clear marks of disapprobation upon it. They found slavery among them, and they left it among them because of the difficulty—the absolute impossibility—of its immediate removal. And when Judge Douglas asks me why we cannot let it remain part slave and part free, as the fathers of the government made it, he asks a question based upon an assumption which is itself a falsehood; and I turn upon him and ask him the question, when the policy that the fathers of the government had adopted in relation to this element among us was the best policy in the world, the only wise policy, the only policy that we can ever safely continue upon that will ever give us peace, unless this dangerous element masters us all and becomes a national institution,—I turn upon him and ask him why he could not leave it alone. I turn and ask him why he was driven to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to it. He has himself said he introduced a new policy. He said so in his speech on the 22d of March of the present year, 1858. I ask him why he could not let it remain where our fathers placed it. I ask, too, of Judge Douglas and his friends why we shall not again place this institution upon the basis on which the fathers left it. I ask you, when he infers that I am in favor of setting the free and slave States at war, when the institution was placed in that attitude by those who made the Constitution, did they make any war? If we had no war out of it when thus placed, wherein is the ground of belief that we shall have war out of it if we return to that policy? Have we had any peace upon this matter springing from any other basis? I maintain that we have not. I have proposed nothing more than a return to the policy of the fathers.

I confess, when I propose a certain measure of policy, it is not enough for me that I do not intend anything evil in the result, but it is incumbent on me to show that it has not a tendency to that result. I have met Judge Douglas in that point of view. I have not only made the declaration that I do not mean to produce a conflict between the States, but I have tried to show by fair reasoning, and I think I have shown to the minds of fair men, that I propose nothing but what has a most peaceful tendency. The quotation that I happened to make in that Springfield Speech, that ""a house divided against itself cannot stand,"" and which has proved so offensive to the judge, was part and parcel of the same thing. He tries to show that variety in the democratic institutions of the different States is necessary and indispensable. I do not dispute it. I have no controversy with Judge Douglas about that. I shall very readily agree with him that it would be foolish for us to insist upon having a cranberry law here in Illinois, where we have no cranberries, because they have a cranberry law in Indiana, where they have cranberries. I should insist that it would be exceedingly wrong in us to deny to Virginia the right to enact oyster laws, where they have oysters, because we want no such laws here. I understand, I hope, quite as well as Judge Douglas or anybody else, that the variety in the soil and climate and face of the country, and consequent variety in the industrial pursuits and productions of a country, require systems of law conforming to this variety in the natural features of the country. I understand quite as well as Judge Douglas that if we here raise a barrel of flour more than we want, and the Louisianians raise a barrel of sugar more than they want, it is of mutual advantage to exchange. That produces commerce, brings us together, and makes us better friends. We like one another the more for it. And I understand as well as Judge Douglas, or anybody else, that these mutual accommodations are the cements which bind together the different parts of this Union; that instead of being a thing to ""divide the house,""—figuratively expressing the Union,—they tend to sustain it; they are the props of the house, tending always to hold it up.

But when I have admitted all this, I ask if there is any parallel between these things and this institution of slavery? I do not see that there is any parallel at all between them. Consider it. When have we had any difficulty or quarrel amongst ourselves about the cranberry laws of Indiana, or the oyster laws of Virginia, or the pine-lumber laws of Maine, or the fact that Louisiana produces sugar, and Illinois flour? When have we had any quarrels over these things? When have we had perfect peace in regard to this thing which I say is an element of discord in this Union? We have sometimes had peace, but when was it? It was when the institution of slavery remained quiet where it was. We have had difficulty and turmoil whenever it has made a struggle to spread itself where it was not. I ask, then, if experience does not speak in thunder-tones telling us that the policy which has given peace to the country heretofore, being returned to, gives the greatest promise of peace again. You may say, and Judge Douglas has intimated the same thing, that all this difficulty in regard to the institution of slavery is the mere agitation of office-seekers and ambitious Northern politicians. He thinks we want to get ""his place,"" I suppose. I agree that there are office-seekers amongst us. The Bible says somewhere that we are desperately selfish. I think we would have discovered that fact without the Bible. I do not claim that I am any less so than the average of men, but I do claim that I am not more selfish than Judge Douglas.
But is it true that all the difficulty and agitation we have in regard to this institution of slavery spring from office-seeking, from the mere ambition of politicians? Is that the truth? How many times have we had danger from this question? Go back to the day of the Missouri Compromise. Go back to the nullification question, at the bottom of which lay this same slavery question. Go back to the time of the annexation of Texas. Go back to the troubles that led to the Compromise of 1850. You will find that every time, with the single exception of the Nullification question, they sprung from an endeavor to spread this institution. There never was a party in the history of this country, and there probably never will be, of sufficient strength to disturb the general peace of the country. Parties themselves may be divided and quarrel on minor questions, yet it extends not beyond the parties themselves. But does not this question make a disturbance outside of political circles? Does it not enter into the churches and rend them asunder? What divided the great Methodist Church into two parts, North and South? What has raised this constant disturbance in every Presbyterian General Assembly that meets? What disturbed the Unitarian Church in this very city two years ago? What has jarred and shaken the great American Tract Society recently, not yet splitting it, but sure to divide it in the end? Is it not this same mighty, deep-seated power that somehow operates on the minds of men, exciting and stirring them up in every avenue of society,—in politics, in religion, in literature, in morals, in all the manifold relations of life? Is this the work of politicians? Is that irresistible power, which for fifty years has shaken the government and agitated the people, to be stifled and subdued by pretending that it is an exceedingly simple thing, and we ought not to talk about it? If you will get everybody else to stop talking about it, I assure you I will quit before they have half done so. But where is the philosophy or statesmanship which assumes that you can quiet that disturbing element in our society which has disturbed us for more than half a century, which has been the only serious danger that has threatened our institutions,—I say, where is the philosophy or the statesmanship based on the assumption that we are to quit talking about it, and that the public mind is all at once to cease being agitated by it? Yet this is the policy here in the North that Douglas is advocating, that we are to care nothing about it! I ask you if it is not a false philosophy. Is it not a false statesmanship that undertakes to build up a system of policy upon the basis of caring nothing about the very thing that everybody does care the most about—a thing which all experience has shown we care a very great deal about?

The Judge alludes very often in the course of his remarks to the exclusive right which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves. I agree with him very readily that the different States have that right. He is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please about it. Our controversy with him is in regard to the new Territories. We agree that when the States come in as States they have the right and the power to do as they please. We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or in our Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union through the General Government, to disturb slavery in the States where it exists. We profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the Sates. What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free from it while in the Territorial condition. Judge Douglas assumes that we have no interest in them,—that we have no right whatever to interfere. I think we have some interest. I think that as white men we have. Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself? Do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there? If you go to the Territory opposed to slavery, and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave, upon the assumption that the things are equal, it turns out that he has the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it your way. If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and by consequence a slave State, is it not time that those who desire to have it a free State were on equal ground? Let me suggest it in a different way. How many Democrats are there about here [""A thousand""] who have left slave States and come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery? [Another voice: ""A thousand and one.""] I reckon there are a thousand and one. I will ask you, if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a Territorial condition, where would you have gone to get rid of it? Where would you have found your free State or Territory to go to? And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to?

Now, irrespective of the moral aspect of this question as to whether there is a right or wrong in enslaving a negro, I am still in favor of our new Territories being in such a condition that white men may find a home,—may find some spot where they can better their condition; where they can settle upon new soil and better their condition in life. I am in favor of this, not merely (I must say it here as I have elsewhere) for our own people who are born amongst us, but as an outlet for free white people everywhere the world over—in which Hans, and Baptiste, and Patrick, and all other men from all the world, may find new homes and better their conditions in life.

I have stated upon former occasions, and I may as well state again, what I understand to be the real issue in this controversy between Judge Douglas and myself. On the point of my wanting to make war between the free and the slave States, there has been no issue between us. So, too, when he assumes that I am in favor of producing a perfect social and political equality between the white and black races. These are false issues, upon which Judge Douglas has tried to force the controversy. There is no foundation in truth for the charge that I maintain either of these propositions. The real issue in this controversy—the one pressing upon every mind—is the sentiment on the part of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong, and of another class that does not look upon it as a wrong. The sentiment that contemplates the institution of slavery in this country as a wrong is the sentiment of the Republican party. It is the sentiment around which all their actions, all their arguments, circle, from which all their propositions radiate. They look upon it as being a moral, social, and political wrong; and while they contemplate it as such, they nevertheless have due regard for its actual existence among us, and the difficulties of getting rid of it in any satisfactory way, and to all the constitutional obligations thrown about it. Yet, having a due regard for these, they desire a policy in regard to it that looks to its not creating any more danger. They insist that it should, as far as may be, be treated as a wrong; and one of the methods of treating it as a wrong is to make provision that it shall grow no larger. They also desire a policy that looks to a peaceful end of slavery at some time. These are the views they entertain in regard to it as I understand them; and all their sentiments, all their arguments and propositions, are brought within this range. I have said, and I repeat it here, that if there be a man amongst us who does not think that the institution of slavery is wrong in any one of the aspects of which I have spoken, he is misplaced, and ought not to be with us. And if there be a man amongst us who is so impatient of it as a wrong as to disregard its actual presence among us and the difficulty of getting rid of it suddenly in a satisfactory way, and to disregard the constitutional obligations thrown about it, that man is misplaced if he is on our platform. We disclaim sympathy with him in practical action. He is not placed properly with us.

On this subject of treating it as a wrong, and limiting its spread, let me say a word. Has anything ever threatened the existence of this Union save and except this very institution of slavery? What is it that we hold most dear amongst us? Our own liberty and prosperity. What has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity, save and except this institution of slavery? If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery, by spreading it out and making it bigger? You may have a wen or cancer upon your person, and not be able to cut it out, lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft it and spread it over your whole body. That is no proper way of treating what you regard a wrong. You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong, restricting the spread of it, and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed. That is the peaceful way, the old-fashioned way, the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example.

On the other hand, I have said there is a sentiment which treats it as not being wrong. That is the Democratic sentiment of this day. I do not mean to say that every man who stands within that range positively asserts that it is right. That class will include all who positively assert that it is right, and all who, like Judge Douglas, treat it as indifferent and do not say it is either right or wrong. These two classes of men fall within the general class of those who do not look upon it as a wrong. And if there be among you anybody who supposes that he, as a Democrat, can consider himself ""as much opposed to slavery as anybody,"" I would like to reason with him. You never treat it as a wrong. What other thing that you consider as a wrong do you deal with as you deal with that? Perhaps you say it is wrong—but your leader never does, and you quarrel with anybody who says it is wrong. Although you pretend to say so yourself, you can find no fit place to deal with it as a wrong. You must not say anything about it in the free States, because it is not here. You must not say anything about it in the slave States, because it is there. You must not say anything about it in the pulpit, because that is religion, and has nothing to do with it. You must not say anything about it in politics, because that will disturb the security of ""my place."" There is no place to talk about it as being a wrong, although you say yourself it is a wrong. But, finally, you will screw yourself up to the belief that if the people of the slave States should adopt a system of gradual emancipation on the slavery question, you would be in favor of it. You would be in favor of it. You say that is getting it in the right place, and you would be glad to see it succeed. But you are deceiving yourself. You all know that Frank Blair and Gratz Brown, down there in St. Louis, undertook to introduce that system in Missouri. They fought as valiantly as they could for the system of gradual emancipation which you pretend you would be glad to see succeed. Now, I will bring you to the test. After a hard fight they were beaten, and when the news came over here, you threw up your hats and hurrahed for Democracy. More than that, take all the argument made in favor of the system you have proposed, and it carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in the institution of slavery. The arguments to sustain that policy carefully exclude it. Even here to-day you heard Judge Douglas quarrel with me because I uttered a wish that it might sometime come to an end. Although Henry Clay could say he wished every slave in the United States was in the country of his ancestors, I am denounced by those pretending to respect Henry Clay for uttering a wish that it might sometime, in some peaceful way, come to an end. The Democratic policy in regard to that institution will not tolerate the merest breath, the slightest hint, of the least degree of wrong about it. Try it by some of Judge Douglas's arguments. He says he ""don't care whether it is voted up or voted down"" in the Territories. I do not care myself, in dealing with that expression, whether it is intended to be expressive of his individual sentiments on the subject, or only of the national policy he desires to have established. It is alike valuable for my purpose. Any man can say that who does not see anything wrong in slavery; but no man can logically say it who does see a wrong in it, because no man can logically say he don't care whether a wrong is voted up or voted down. He may say he don't care whether an indifferent thing is voted up or down, but he must logically have a choice between a right thing and a wrong thing. He contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them. So they have, if it is not a wrong. But if it is a wrong, he cannot say people have a right to do wrong. He says that upon the score of equality slaves should be allowed to go in a new Territory, like other property. This is strictly logical if there is no difference between it and other property. If it and other property are equal, this argument is entirely logical. But if you insist that one is wrong and the other right, there is no use to institute a comparison between right and wrong. You may turn over everything in the Democratic policy from beginning to end, whether in the shape it takes on the statute book, in the shape it takes in the Dred Scott decision, in the shape it takes in conversation, or the shape it takes in short maxim-like arguments,—it everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in it.

That is the real issue. That is the issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Judge Douglas and myself shall be silent. It is the eternal struggle between these two principles—right and wrong—throughout the world. They are the two principles that have stood face to face from the beginning of time, and will ever continue to struggle. The one is the common right of humanity, and the other the divine right of kings. It is the same principle in whatever shape it develops itself. It is the same spirit that says, ""You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it."" No matter in what shape it comes, whether from the mouth of a king who seeks to bestride the people of his own nation and live by the fruit of their labor, or from one race of men as an apology for enslaving another race, it is the same tyrannical principle. I was glad to express my gratitude at Quincy, and I re-express it here, to Judge Douglas,—that he looks to no end of the institution of slavery. That will help the people to see where the struggle really is. It will hereafter place with us all men who really do wish the wrong may have an end. And whenever we can get rid of the fog which obscures the real question, when we can get Judge Douglas and his friends to avow a policy looking to its perpetuation,—we can get out from among that class of men and bring them to the side of those who treat it as a wrong. Then there will soon be an end of it, and that end will be its ""ultimate extinction."" Whenever the issue can be distinctly made, and all extraneous matter thrown out so that men can fairly see the real difference between the parties, this controversy will soon be settled, and it will be done peaceably too. There will be no war, no violence. It will be placed again where the wisest and best men of the world placed it. Brooks of South Carolina once declared that when this Constitution was framed its framers did not look to the institution existing until this day. When he said this, I think he stated a fact that is fully borne out by the history of the times. But he also said they were better and wiser men than the men of these days, yet the men of these days had experience which they had not, and by the invention of the cotton-gin it became a necessity in this country that slavery should be perpetual. I now say that, willingly or unwillingly—purposely or without purpose, Judge Douglas has been the most prominent instrument in changing the position of the institution of slavery,—which the fathers of the government expected to come to an end ere this, and putting it upon Brooks's cotton-gin basis; placing it where he openly confesses he has no desire there shall ever be an end of it.

I understand I have ten minutes yet. I will employ it in saying something about this argument Judge Douglas uses, while he sustains the Dred Scott decision, that the people of the Territories can still somehow exclude slavery. The first thing I ask attention to is the fact that Judge Douglas constantly said, before the decision, that whether they could or not, was a question for the Supreme Court. But after the court had made the decision he virtually says it is not a question for the Supreme Court, but for the people. And how is it he tells us they can exclude it? He says it needs ""police regulations,"" and that admits of ""unfriendly legislation."" Although it is a right established by the Constitution of the United States to take a slave into a Territory of the United States and hold him as property, yet unless the Territorial Legislature will give friendly legislation, and more especially if they adopt unfriendly legislation, they can practically exclude him. Now, without meeting this proposition as a matter of fact, I pass to consider the real constitutional obligation. Let me take the gentleman who looks me in the face before me, and let us suppose that he is a member of the Territorial Legislature. The first thing he will do will be to swear that he will support the Constitution of the United States. His neighbor by his side in the Territory has slaves and needs Territorial legislation to enable him to enjoy that constitutional right. Can he withhold the legislation which his neighbor needs for the enjoyment of a right which is fixed in his favor in the Constitution of the United States which he has sworn to support? Can he withhold it without violating his oath? And, more especially, can he pass unfriendly legislation to violate his oath? Why, this is a monstrous sort of talk about the Constitution of the United States! There has never been as outlandish or lawless a doctrine from the mouth of any respectable man on earth. I do not believe it is a constitutional right to hold slaves in a Territory of the United States. I believe the decision was improperly made and I go for reversing it. Judge Douglas is furious against those who go for reversing a decision. But he is for legislating it out of all force while the law itself stands. I repeat that there has never been so monstrous a doctrine uttered from the mouth of a respectable man.

I suppose most of us (I know it of myself) believe that the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law,—that is a right fixed in the Constitution. But it cannot be made available to them without Congressional legislation. In the Judge's language, it is a ""barren right,"" which needs legislation before it can become efficient and valuable to the persons to whom it is guaranteed. And as the right is constitutional, I agree that the legislation shall be granted to it, and that not that we like the institution of slavery. We profess to have no taste for running and catching niggers, at least, I profess no taste for that job at all. Why then do I yield support to a Fugitive Slave law? Because I do not understand that the Constitution, which guarantees that right, can be supported without it. And if I believed that the right to hold a slave in a Territory was equally fixed in the Constitution with the right to reclaim fugitives, I should be bound to give it the legislation necessary to support it. I say that no man can deny his obligation to give the necessary legislation to support slavery in a Territory, who believes it is a constitutional right to have it there. No man can, who does not give the Abolitionists an argument to deny the obligation enjoined by the Constitution to enact a Fugitive State law. Try it now. It is the strongest Abolition argument ever made. I say if that Dred Scott decision is correct, then the right to hold slaves in a Territory is equally a constitutional right with the right of a slaveholder to have his runaway returned. No one can show the distinction between them. The one is express, so that we cannot deny it. The other is construed to be in the Constitution, so that he who believes the decision to be correct believes in the right. And the man who argues that by unfriendly legislation, in spite of that constitutional right, slavery may be driven from the Territories, cannot avoid furnishing an argument by which Abolitionists may deny the obligation to return fugitives, and claim the power to pass laws unfriendly to the right of the slaveholder to reclaim his fugitive. I do not know how such an arguement may strike a popular assembly like this, but I defy anybody to go before a body of men whose minds are educated to estimating evidence and reasoning, and show that there is an iota of difference between the constitutional right to reclaim a fugitive and the constitutional right to hold a slave, in a Territory, provided this Dred Scott decision is correct, I defy any man to make an argument that will justify unfriendly legislation to deprive a slaveholder of his right to hold his slave in a Territory, that will not equally, in all its length, breadth, and thickness, furnish an argument for nullifying the Fugitive Slave law. Why, there is not such an Abolitionist in the nation as Douglas, after all!Embed"

Over the last 50 years (that is, since present management took over), per-share book value has grown from $19 to $146,186, a rate of 19.4% compounded annually.*

During our tenure, we have consistently compared the yearly performance of the S&P 500 to the change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. We’ve done that because book value has been a crude, but useful, tracking device for the number that really counts: intrinsic business value.

In our early decades, the relationship between book value and intrinsic value was much closer than it is now. That was true because Berkshire’s assets were then largely securities whose values were continuously restated to reflect their current market prices. In Wall Street parlance, most of the assets involved in the calculation of book value were “marked to market.”

Today, our emphasis has shifted in a major way to owning and operating large businesses. Many of these are worth far more than their cost-based carrying value. But that amount is never revalued upward no matter how much the value of these companies has increased. Consequently, the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its book value has materially widened.

With that in mind, we have added a new set of data — the historical record of Berkshire’s stock price — to the performance table on the facing page. Market prices, let me stress, have their limitations in the short term. Monthly or yearly movements of stocks are often erratic and not indicative of changes in intrinsic value. Over time, however, stock prices and intrinsic value almost invariably converge. Charlie Munger, Berkshire Vice Chairman and my partner, and I believe that has been true at Berkshire: In our view, the increase in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value over the past 50 years is roughly equal to the 1,826,163% gain in market price of the company’s shares.

    * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of those shown for A.The Year at Berkshire It was a good year for Berkshire on all major fronts, except one. Here are the important developments:Our “Powerhouse Five” — a collection of Berkshire’s largest non-insurance businesses — had a record $12.4 billion of pre-tax earnings in 2014, up $1.6 billion from 2013.* The companies in this sainted group are Berkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly MidAmerican Energy), BNSF, IMC (I’ve called it Iscar in the past), Lubrizol and Marmon.

Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us a decade ago. Subsequently we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the number outstanding by 6.1%. In other words, the $12 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire by the five companies over the ten-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfies our goal of not simply increasing earnings, but making sure we also increase per-shareresults.

If the U.S. economy continues to improve in 2015, we expect earnings of our Powerhouse Five to improve as well. The gain could reach $1 billion, in part because of bolt-on acquisitions by the group that have already closed or are under contract.Our bad news from 2014 comes from our group of five as well and is unrelated to earnings. During the year, BNSF disappointed many of its customers. These shippers depend on us, and service failures can badly hurt their businesses.

BNSF is, by far, Berkshire’s most important non-insurance subsidiary and, to improve its performance, we will spend $6 billion on plant and equipment in 2015. That sum is nearly 50% more than any other railroad has spent in a single year and is a truly extraordinary amount, whether compared to revenues, earnings or depreciation charges.

Though weather, which was particularly severe last year, will always cause railroads a variety of operating problems, our responsibility is to do whatever it takesto restore our service to industry-leading levels. That can’t be done overnight: The extensive work required to increase system capacity sometimes disrupts operations while it is underway. Recently, however, our outsized expenditures are beginning to show results. During the last three months, BNSF’s performance metrics have materially improved from last year’s figures.Our many dozens of smaller non-insurance businesses earned $5.1 billion last year, up from $4.7 billion in 2013. Here, as with our Powerhouse Five, we expect further gains in 2015. Within this group, we have two companies that last year earned between $400 million and $600 million, six that earned between $250 million and $400 million, and seven that earned between $100 million and $250 million. This collection of businesses will increase in both number and earnings. Our ambitions have no finish line.    Berkshire’s huge and growing insurance operation again operated at an underwriting profit in 2014 — that makes 12 years in a row — and increased its float. During that 12-year stretch, our float — money that doesn’t belong to us but that we can invest for Berkshire’s benefit — has grown from $41 billion to $84 billion. Though neither that gain nor the size of our float is reflected in Berkshire’s earnings, float generates significant investment income because of the assets it allows us to hold.

Meanwhile, our underwriting profit totaled $24 billion during the twelve-year period, including $2.7 billion earned in 2014. And all of this began with our 1967 purchase of National Indemnity for $8.6 million.While Charlie and I search for new businesses to buy, our many subsidiaries are regularly making bolt-on acquisitions. Last year was particularly fruitful: We contracted for 31 bolt-ons, scheduled to cost $7.8 billion in aggregate. The size of these transactions ranged from $400,000 to $2.9 billion. However, the largest acquisition, Duracell, will not close until the second half of this year. It will then be placed under Marmon’s jurisdiction.

Charlie and I encourage bolt-ons, if they are sensibly-priced. (Most deals offered us aren’t.) They deploy capital in activities that fit with our existing businesses and that will be managed by our corps of expert managers. This means no more work for us, yet more earnings, a combination we find particularly appealing. We will make many more of these bolt-on deals in future years.             Two years ago my friend, Jorge Paulo Lemann, asked Berkshire to join his 3G Capital group in the acquisition of Heinz. My affirmative response was a no-brainer: I knew immediately that this partnership would work well from both a personal and financial standpoint. And it most definitely has.

I’m not embarrassed to admit that Heinz is run far better under Alex Behring, Chairman, and Bernardo Hees, CEO, than would be the case if I were in charge. They hold themselves to extraordinarily high performance standards and are never satisfied, even when their results far exceed those of competitors.

We expect to partner with 3G in more activities. Sometimes our participation will only involve a financing role, as was the case in the recent acquisition of Tim Hortons by Burger King. Our favored arrangement, however, will usually be to link up as a permanent equity partner (who, in some cases, contributes to the financing of the deal as well). Whatever the structure, we feel good when working with Jorge Paulo.

Berkshire also has fine partnerships with Mars and Leucadia, and we may form new ones with them or with other partners. Our participation in any joint activities, whether as a financing or equity partner, will be limited to friendly transactions.            In October, we contracted to buy Van Tuyl Automotive, a group of 78 automobile dealerships that is exceptionally well-run. Larry Van Tuyl, the company’s owner, and I met some years ago. He then decided that if he were ever to sell his company, its home should be Berkshire. Our purchase was recently completed, and we are now “car guys.”

Larry and his dad, Cecil, spent 62 years building the group, following a strategy that made owner-partners of all local managers. Creating this mutuality of interests proved over and over to be a winner. Van Tuyl is now the fifth-largest automotive group in the country, with per-dealership sales figures that are outstanding.

In recent years, Jeff Rachor has worked alongside Larry, a successful arrangement that will continue. There are about 17,000 dealerships in the country, and ownership transfers always require approval by the relevant auto manufacturer. Berkshire’s job is to perform in a manner that will cause manufacturers to welcome further purchases by us. If we do this — and if we can buy dealerships at sensible prices — we will build a business that before long will be multiples the size of Van Tuyl’s $9 billion of sales.

With the acquisition of Van Tuyl, Berkshire now owns 9½ companies that would be listed on the Fortune 500 were they independent (Heinz is the ½). That leaves 490½ fish in the sea. Our lines are out.     Our subsidiaries spent a record $15 billion on plant and equipment during 2014, well over twice their depreciation charges. About 90% of that money was spent in the United States. Though we will always invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America. The treasures that have been uncovered up to now are dwarfed by those still untapped. Through dumb luck, Charlie and I were born in the United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has given us.    Berkshire’s yearend employees — including those at Heinz — totaled a record 340,499, up 9,754 from last year. The increase, I am proud to say, included no gain at headquarters (where 25 people work). No sense going crazy.            Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments — American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our ownership to 7.8% versus 6.3% at yearend 2013). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola, American Express and Wells Fargo raised our percentage ownership of each. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 9.1% to 9.2%, our interest in American Express increased from 14.2% to 14.8% and our ownership of Wells Fargo grew from 9.2% to 9.4%. And, if you think tenths of a percent aren’t important, ponder this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one-tenth of a percent in our ownership raises Berkshire’s portion of their annual earnings by $50 million.
These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire, we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100% of a so-so business. It’s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone.

If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2014 earnings before discontinued operations amounted to $4.7 billion (compared to $3.3 billion only three years ago). In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends we receive — about $1.6 billion last year. (Again, three years ago the dividends were $862 million.) But make no mistake: The $3.1 billion of these companies’ earnings we don’t report are every bit as valuable to us as the portion Berkshire records.

The earnings these investees retain are often used for repurchases of their own stock — a move that enhances Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Their retained earnings also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expect that the per-share earnings of these four investees, in aggregate, will grow substantially over time (though 2015 will be a tough year for the group, in part because of the strong dollar). If the expected gains materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains. (For the package of four, our unrealized gains already totaled $42 billion at yearend.)

Our flexibility in capital allocation — our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses — gives us a significant advantage over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they can operate. Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash.  I’ve mentioned in the past that my experience in business helps me as an investor and that my investment experience has made me a better businessman. Each pursuit teaches lessons that are applicable to the other. And some truths can only be fully learned through experience. (In Fred Schwed’s wonderful book, Where Are the Customers’ Yachts?, a Peter Arno cartoon depicts a puzzled Adam looking at an eager Eve, while a caption says, “There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin either by words or pictures.” If you haven’t read Schwed’s book, buy a copy at our annual meeting. Its wisdom and humor are truly priceless.)

Among Arno’s “certain things,” I would include two separate skills, the evaluation of investments and the management of businesses. I therefore think it’s worthwhile for Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our two investment managers, to each have oversight of at least one of our businesses. A sensible opportunity for them to do so opened up a few months ago when we agreed to purchase two companies that, though smaller than we would normally acquire, have excellent economic characteristics. Combined, the two earn $100 million annually on about $125 million of net tangible assets.

I’ve asked Todd and Ted to each take on one as Chairman, in which role they will function in the very limited way that I do with our larger subsidiaries. This arrangement will save me a minor amount of work and, more important, make the two of them even better investors than they already are (which is to say among the best).    ************

Late in 2009, amidst the gloom of the Great Recession, we agreed to buy BNSF, the largest purchase in Berkshire’s history. At the time, I called the transaction an “all-in wager on the economic future of the United States.”

That kind of commitment was nothing new for us. We’ve been making similar wagers ever since Buffett Partnership Ltd. acquired control of Berkshire in 1965. For good reason, too: Charlie and I have always considered a “bet” on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be very close to a sure thing.

Indeed, who has ever benefited during the past 238 years by betting against America? If you compare our country’s present condition to that existing in 1776, you have to rub your eyes in wonder. In my lifetime alone, real per-capita U.S. output has sextupled. My parents could not have dreamed in 1930 of the world their son would see. Though the preachers of pessimism prattle endlessly about America’s problems, I’ve never seen one who wishes to emigrate (though I can think of a few for whom I would happily buy a one-way ticket).

The dynamism embedded in our market economy will continue to work its magic. Gains won’t come in a smooth or uninterrupted manner; they never have. And we will regularly grumble about our government. But, most assuredly, America’s best days lie ahead.

With this tailwind working for us, Charlie and I hope to build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by

(1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5) making an occasional large acquisition. We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever, issuing Berkshire shares.

Those building blocks rest on a rock-solid foundation. A century hence, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy will still be playing vital roles in our economy. Homes and autos will remain central to the lives of most families. Insurance will continue to be essential for both businesses and individuals. Looking ahead, Charlie and I see a world made to order for Berkshire. We feel fortunate to be entrusted with its management.Intrinsic Business Value As much as Charlie and I talk about intrinsic business value, we cannot tell you precisely what that number is for Berkshire shares (nor, in fact, for any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the three elements — one of them qualitative — that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsic value. That discussion is reproduced in full on pages 123-124.
Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2014 our per-share investments increased 8.4% to $140,123, and our earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments increased 19% to $10,847 per share.

Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19% compounded annually, and our earnings figure has grown at a 20.6% clip. It is no coincidence that the price of Berkshire stock over the ensuing 44 years has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main focus is to build operating earnings. That’s why we were pleased to exchange our Phillips 66 and Graham Holdings stock for operating businesses last year and to contract with Procter and Gamble to acquire Duracell by means of a similar exchange set to close in 2015.

************

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. So we’ll present them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them (though there are important and enduring advantages to having them all under one roof). Our goal is to provide you with the information we would wish to have if our positions were reversed, with you being the reporting manager and we the absentee shareholders. (But don’t get any ideas!)Insurance Let’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation. That industry has been the engine that has propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Though that purchase had monumental consequences for Berkshire, its execution was simplicity itself.

Jack Ringwalt, a friend of mine who was the controlling shareholder of the two companies, came to my office saying he would like to sell. Fifteen minutes later, we had a deal. Neither of Jack’s companies had ever had an audit by a public accounting firm, and I didn’t ask for one. My reasoning: (1) Jack was honest and (2) He was also a bit quirky and likely to walk away if the deal became at all complicated.

On pages 128-129, we reproduce the 1½-page purchase agreement we used to finalize the transaction. That contract was homemade: Neither side used a lawyer. Per page, this has to be Berkshire’s best deal: National Indemnity today has GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net worth of $111 billion, which exceeds that of any other insurer in the world.

One reason we were attracted to the property-casualty business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums — money we call “float” — that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown, as the following table shows:Year Float (in $ millions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2014 83,921 Further gains in float will be tough to achieve. On the plus side, GEICO and our new commercial insurance operation are almost certain to grow at a good clip. National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do in time experience a decline in float, it will be very gradual — at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate demands for sums that are large compared to our cash resources. This strength is a key pillar in Berkshire’s economic fortress.

If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money — and, better yet, get paid for holding it.

Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous indeed that it frequently causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangible net worth as compared to other American businesses. The prolonged period of low interest rates our country is now dealing with causes earnings on float to decrease, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of the industry.

As noted in the first section of this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for twelve consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $24 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will continue to underwrite profitably in most years. Doing so is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, who know that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. That message is given at least lip service by all insurers; at Berkshire it is a religion.

So how does our float affect intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to think of float as strictly a liability is incorrect; it should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. Daily, we pay old claims and related expenses — a huge $22.7 billion to more than six million claimants in 2014 — and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business and thereby generate new claims that add to float.

If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability. Owing $1 that in effect will never leave the premises — because new business is almost certain to deliver a substitute — is worlds different from owing $1 that will go out the door tomorrow and not be replaced. The two types of liabilities are treated as equals, however, under GAAP.

A partial offset to this overstated liability is a $15.5 billion “goodwill” asset that we incurred in buying our insurance companies and that increases book value. In very large part, this goodwill represents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost.

Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill — what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it — to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. Under present accounting rules (with which we agree) this excess value will never be entered on our books. But I can assure you that it’s real. That’s one reason — a huge reason — why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantially exceeds its book value.

************

Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the major units.

First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.

Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe — a loss about triple anything it has ever experienced — Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities in a market that might well have gone into shock. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers would be far in the red, if not facing insolvency.

Ajit’s underwriting skills are unmatched. His mind, moreover, is an idea factory that is always looking for more lines of business he can add to his current assortment. Last year I told you about his formation of Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”). This initiative took us into commercial insurance, where we were instantly welcomed by both major insurance brokers and corporate risk managers throughout America. Previously, we had written only a few specialized lines of commercial insurance.

BHSI is led by Peter Eastwood, an experienced underwriter who is widely respected in the insurance world. During 2014, Peter expanded his talented group, moving into both international business and new lines of insurance. We repeat last year’s prediction that BHSI will be a major asset for Berkshire, one that will generate volume in the billions within a few years.

************

We have another reinsurance powerhouse in General Re, managed by Tad Montross.

At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premium can’t be obtained.

Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.

Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge float has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistently and profitably since we acquired the company in 1998.

It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused commentators — and me as well, briefly — to believe I had made a huge mistake. That day is long gone. General Re is now a gem.

************

Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 64 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18 and completed 53 years of service in 2014. Tony became CEO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony.

When I was first introduced to GEICO in January 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed compared to the expenses borne by the giants of the industry. It was clear to me that GEICO would succeed because it deserved to succeed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently needed is a major expenditure for most families. Savings matter to them — and only a low-cost operation can deliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stop reading and go to geico.com or call 800-368-2734.

GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. (We ended 2014 at 10.8% compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.) The company’s low costs create a moat — an enduring one — that competitors are unable to cross. Our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. The gecko, I should add, has one particularly endearing quality — he works without pay. Unlike a human spokesperson, he never gets a swelled head from his fame nor does he have an agent to constantly remind us how valuable he is. I love the little guy.

************

In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies, most of them plying their trade in odd corners of the insurance world. In aggregate, these companies are a growing operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit. Indeed, over the past decade, they have earned $2.95 billion from underwriting while growing their float from $1.7 billion to $8.6 billion. Charlie and I treasure these companies and their managers.

[[ INSURANCE PERFORMANCE TABLE ]]

************

Simply put, insurance is the sale of promises. The “customer” pays money now; the insurer promises to pay money in the future should certain unwanted events occur.

Sometimes, the promise will not be tested for decades. (Think of life insurance bought by people in their 20s.) Therefore, both the ability and willingness of the insurer to pay, even if economic chaos prevails when payment time arrives, is all-important.

Berkshire’s promises have no equal, a fact affirmed in recent years by certain of the world’s largest and most sophisticated P/C insurers, who wished to shed themselves of huge and exceptionally long-lived liabilities. That is, these insurers wished to “cede” these liabilities — most of them potential losses from asbestos claims — to a reinsurer. They needed the right one, though: If a reinsurer fails to pay a loss, the original insurer is still on the hook for it. Choosing a reinsurer, therefore, that down the road proves to be financially strapped or a bad actor threatens the original insurer with getting huge liabilities right back in its lap.

Last year, our premier position in reinsurance was reaffirmed by our writing a policy carrying a $3 billion single premium. I believe that the policy’s size has only been exceeded by our 2007 transaction with Lloyd’s, in which the premium was $7.1 billion.

In fact, I know of only eight P/C policies in history that had a single premium exceeding $1 billion. And, yes, all eight were written by Berkshire. Certain of these contracts will require us to make substantial payments 50 years or more from now. When major insurers have needed an unquestionable promise that payments of this type will be made, Berkshire has been the party — the only party — to call.

************

Berkshire’s great managers, premier financial strength and a variety of business models protected by wide moats amount to something unique in the insurance world. This assemblage of strengths is a huge asset for Berkshire shareholders that will only get more valuable with time.Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses We have two major operations, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), that share important characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement.

A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each company has earning power that even under terrible economic conditions will far exceed its interest requirements. Last year, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was more than 8:1. (Our definition of coverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly used measure we view as seriously flawed.)

At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great diversity of earnings streams, which shield us from being seriously harmed by any single regulatory body. Recently, we have further broadened that base through our $3 billion (Canadian) acquisition of AltaLink, an electric transmission system serving 85% of Alberta’s population. This multitude of profit streams, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, has enabled BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower their cost of debt. This economic fact benefits both us and our customers.

Every day, our two subsidiaries power the American economy in major ways:BNSF carries about 15% (measured by ton-miles) of all inter-city freight, whether it is transported by truck, rail, water, air, or pipeline. Indeed, we move more ton-miles of goods than anyone else, a fact establishing BNSF as the most important artery in our economy’s circulatory system.BNSF, like all railroads, also moves its cargo in an extraordinarily fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly way, carrying a ton of freight about 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. Trucks taking on the same job guzzle about four times as much fuel.BHE’s utilities serve regulated retail customers in eleven states. No utility company stretches further. In addition, we are a leader in renewables: From a standing start ten years ago, BHE now accounts for 6% of the country’s wind generation capacity and 7% of its solar generation capacity. Beyond these businesses, BHE owns two large pipelines that deliver 8% of our country’s natural gas consumption; the recently-purchased electric transmission operation in Canada; and major electric businesses in the U.K. and Philippines. And the beat goes on: We will continue to buy and build utility operations throughout the world for decades to come.
BHE can make these investments because it retains all of its earnings. In fact, last year the company retained more dollars of earnings — by far — than any other American electric utility. We and our regulators see this 100% retention policy as an important advantage — one almost certain to distinguish BHE from other utilities for many years to come.When BHE completes certain renewables projects that are underway, the company’s renewables portfolio will have cost $15 billion. In addition, we have conventional projects in the works that will also cost many billions. We relish making such commitments as long as they promise reasonable returns — and, on that front, we put a large amount of trust in future regulation.

Our confidence is justified both by our past experience and by the knowledge that society will forever need massive investments in both transportation and energy. It is in the self-interest of governments to treat capital providers in a manner that will ensure the continued flow of funds to essential projects. It is concomitantly in our self-interest to conduct our operations in a way that earns the approval of our regulators and the people they represent.

Last year we fully met this objective at BHE, just as we have in every year of our ownership. Our rates remain low, our customer satisfaction is high and our record for employee safety is among the best in the industry.

The story at BNSF, however — as I noted earlier — was not good in 2014, a year in which the railroad disappointed many of its customers. This problem occurred despite the record capital expenditures that BNSF has made in recent years, with those having far exceeded the outlays made by Union Pacific, our principal competitor.

The two railroads are of roughly equal size measured by revenues, though we carry considerably more freight (measured either by carloads or ton-miles). But our service problems exceeded Union Pacific’s last year, and we lost market share as a result. Moreover, U.P.’s earnings beat ours by a record amount. Clearly, we have a lot of work to do.

We are wasting no time: As I also mentioned earlier, we will spend $6 billion in 2015 on improving our railroad’s operation. That will amount to about 26% of estimated revenues (a calculation that serves as the industry’s yardstick). Outlays of this magnitude are largely unheard of among railroads. For us, this percentage compares to our average of 18% in 2009-2013 and to U.P.’s projection for the near future of 16-17%. Our huge investments will soon lead to a system with greater capacity and much better service. Improved profits should follow.

Here are the key figures for Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF:

[[ BHE and BNSF PERFORMANCE TABLE ]]Manufacturing, Service and Retailing Operations Our activities in this part of Berkshire cover the waterfront. Let’s look, though, at a summary balance sheet and earnings statement for the entire group.

[[ MANUFACTURING, SERVICE, RETAIL PERFORMANCE TABLE ]]

* Earnings for 2012 and 2013 have been restated to exclude Marmon’s leasing operations, which are now included in the Finance and Financial Products section.

Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 49. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP and exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAP figures.

I won’t explain all of the adjustments — some are tiny and arcane — but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. The concept of making charges against other intangibles, such as the amortization of customer relationships, however, arises through purchase-accounting rules and clearly does not reflect reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated — even though from an investor’s viewpoint they could not be more different.

In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 49, amortization charges of $1.15 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once nonexistent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real amortization charges will almost certainly rise further as we acquire more companies.

The GAAP-compliant table on page 67 gives you the current status of our intangible assets. We now have $7.4 billion left to amortize, of which $4.1 billion will be charged over the next five years. Eventually, of course, every dollar of non-real costs becomes entirely charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increase even if true earnings are flat.

Depreciation charges, we want to emphasize, are different: Every dime of depreciation expense we report is a real cost. That’s true, moreover, at most other companies. When CEOs tout EBITDA as a valuation guide, wire them up for a polygraph test.

Our public reports of earnings will, of course, continue to conform to GAAP. To embrace reality, however, you should remember to add back most of the amortization charges we report.

To get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, they sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generate good returns in the area of 12% to 20%. A few, however, have very poor returns, the result of some serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation. I was not misled: I simply was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates.

Fortunately, my blunders normally involved relatively small acquisitions. Our large buys have generally worked out well and, in a few cases, more than well. I have not, nonetheless, made my last mistake in purchasing either businesses or stocks. Not everything works out as planned.

Viewed as a single entity, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employed an average of $24 billion of net tangible assets during 2014 and, despite their holding large quantities of excess cash and using little leverage, earned 18.7% after-tax on that capital.

Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought for too high a price. We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses, a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill. Overall, however, we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed in this sector. Furthermore, the intrinsic value of these businesses, in aggregate, exceeds their carrying value by a good margin, and that premium is likely to widen. Even so, the difference between intrinsic value and carrying value in both the insurance and regulated-industry segments is far greater. It is there that the truly big winners reside.

************

We have far too many companies in this group to comment on them individually. Moreover, their competitors — both current and potential — read this report. In a few of our businesses we might be disadvantaged if others knew our numbers. In some of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, therefore, we only disclose what is required. You can find a good bit of detail about many of our operations, however, on pages 97-100.Finance and Financial Products This year we include in this section Marmon’s very sizable leasing operations, whose wares are railcars, containers and cranes. We have also restated the previous two years to reflect that change. Why have we made it? At one time there was a large minority ownership at Marmon, and I felt it was more understandable to include all of the company’s operations in one place. Today we own virtually 100% of Marmon, which makes me think you will gain more insight into our various businesses if we include Marmon’s leasing operations under this heading. (The figures for the many dozens of Marmon’s other businesses remain in the previous section.)

Our other leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture) and XTRA (semi-trailers). These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. Both companies have invested more money in new equipment than have many of their competitors, and that’s paying off.

Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the largest home builder in America. Last year, Clayton sold 30,871 homes, about 45% of the manufactured homes bought by Americans. When we purchased Clayton in 2003 for $1.7 billion, its share was 14%.

Key to Clayton’s earnings is the company’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. During the financial panic of 2008 and 2009, when funding for the industry dried up, Clayton was able to keep lending because of Berkshire’s backing. In fact, we continued during that period to finance our competitors’ retail sales as well as our own.

Many of Clayton’s borrowers have low incomes and mediocre FICO scores. But thanks to the company’s sensible lending practices, its portfolio performed well during the recession, meaning a very high percentage of our borrowers kept their homes. Our blue-collar borrowers, in many cases, proved much better credit risks than their higher-income brethren.

At Marmon’s railroad-car operation, lease rates have improved substantially over the past few years. The nature of this business, however, is that only 20% or so of our leases expire annually. Consequently, improved pricing only gradually works its way into our revenue stream. The trend, though, is strong. Our 105,000-car fleet consists largely of tank cars, but only 8% of those transport crude oil.

One further fact about our rail operation is important for you to know: Unlike many other lessors, we manufacture our own tank cars, about 6,000 of them in a good year. We do not book any profit when we transfer cars from our manufacturing division to our leasing division. Our fleet is consequently placed on our books at a “bargain” price. The difference between that figure and a “retail” price is only slowly reflected in our earnings through smaller annual depreciation charges that we enjoy over the 30-year life of the car. Because of that fact as well as others, Marmon’s rail fleet is worth considerably more than the $5 billion figure at which it is carried on our books.

Here’s the earnings recap for this sector:

[[ FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TABLE ]]Investments Below we list our fifteen common stock investments that at yearend had the largest market value.

[[ COMMON STOCK PERFORMANCE TABLE ]]

Berkshire has one major equity position that is not included in the table: We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At yearend these shares were worth $12.5 billion. We are likely to purchase the shares just before expiration of our option. In the meantime, it is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth largest equity investment — and one we value highly.

************

Attentive readers will notice that Tesco, which last year appeared in the list of our largest common stock investments, is now absent. An attentive investor, I’m embarrassed to report, would have sold Tesco shares earlier. I made a big mistake with this investment by dawdling.

At the end of 2012 we owned 415 million shares of Tesco, then and now the leading food retailer in the

U.K. and an important grocer in other countries as well. Our cost for this investment was $2.3 billion, and the market value was a similar amount.

In 2013, I soured somewhat on the company’s then-management and sold 114 million shares, realizing a profit of $43 million. My leisurely pace in making sales would prove expensive. Charlie calls this sort of behavior “thumb-sucking.” (Considering what my delay cost us, he is being kind.)

During 2014, Tesco’s problems worsened by the month. The company’s market share fell, its margins contracted and accounting problems surfaced. In the world of business, bad news often surfaces serially: You see a cockroach in your kitchen; as the days go by, you meet his relatives.

We sold Tesco shares throughout the year and are now out of the position. (The company, we should mention, has hired new management, and we wish them well.) Our after-tax loss from this investment was $444 million, about 1/5 of 1% of Berkshire’s net worth. In the past 50 years, we have only once realized an investment loss that at the time of sale cost us 2% of our net worth. Twice, we experienced 1% losses. All three of these losses occurred in the 1974-1975 period, when we sold stocks that were very cheap in order to buy others we believed to be even cheaper.

************

Our investment results have been helped by a terrific tailwind. During the 1964-2014 period, the S&P 500 rose from 84 to 2,059, which, with reinvested dividends, generated the overall return of 11,196% shown on page 2. Concurrently, the purchasing power of the dollar declined a staggering 87%. That decrease means that it now takes $1 to buy what could be bought for 13¢ in 1965 (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).

There is an important message for investors in that disparate performance between stocks and dollars. Think back to our 2011 annual report, in which we defined investing as “the transfer to others of purchasing power now with the reasoned expectation of receiving more purchasing power — after taxes have been paid on nominal gains — in the future.”

The unconventional, but inescapable, conclusion to be drawn from the past fifty years is that it has been far safer to invest in a diversified collection of American businesses than to invest in securities — Treasuries, for example — whose values have been tied to American currency. That was also true in the preceding half-century, a period including the Great Depression and two world wars. Investors should heed this history. To one degree or another it is almost certain to be repeated during the next century.

Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments are riskier investments — far riskier investments — than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That lesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for risk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.

It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and purchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors — say, investment banks — whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell securities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds should keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.

For the great majority of investors, however, who can — and should — invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing power over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less risky than dollar-based securities.

If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may, ironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned falling stock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this sermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (The S&P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these investors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund whose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and downs, to be sure).

Investors, of course, can, by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active trading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees to managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of equities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has no place in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can happen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator — and definitely not Charlie nor I — can tell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.

The commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to “the little guy.” Huge institutional investors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits tight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn, recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.

There are a few investment managers, of course, who are very good — though in the short run, it’s difficult to determine whether a great record is due to luck or talent. Most advisors, however, are far better at generating high fees than they are at generating high returns. In truth, their core competence is salesmanship. Rather than listen to their siren songs, investors — large and small — should instead read Jack Bogle’s The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.

Decades ago, Ben Graham pinpointed the blame for investment failure, using a quote from Shakespeare: “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”The Annual Meeting The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, May 2nd at the CenturyLink Center. Last year’s attendance of 39,000 set a record, and we expect a further increase this year as we celebrate our Golden Anniversary. Be there when the doors open at 7 a.m.

Berkshire’s talented Carrie Sova will again be in charge. Carrie joined us six years ago at the age of 24 as a secretary. Then, four years ago, I asked her to take charge of the meeting — a huge undertaking, requiring a multitude of skills — and she jumped at the chance. Carrie is unflappable, ingenious and expert at bringing out the best in the hundreds who work with her. She is aided by our entire home office crew who enjoy pitching in to make the weekend fun and informative for our owners.

And, yes, we also try to sell our visiting shareholders our products while they’re here. In fact, this year we will substantially increase the hours available for purchases, opening for business at the CenturyLink on Friday, May 1st, from noon to 5 p.m. as well as the usual 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on meeting day. So bring a smile to Charlie’s face and do some serious shopping.

Get up early on Saturday morning. At 6:20 a.m., Norman and Jake, two Texas longhorns each weighing about a ton, will proceed down 10th Street to the CenturyLink. Aboard them will be a couple of our Justin Boot executives, who do double duty as cowboys. Following the steers will be four horses pulling a Wells Fargo stagecoach. Berkshire already markets planes, trains and automobiles. Adding steers and stagecoaches to our portfolio should seal our reputation as America’s all-purpose transportation company.

At about 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, we will have our fourth International Newspaper Tossing Challenge. Our target again will be a Clayton Home porch, located precisely 35 feet from the throwing line. When I was a teenager — in my one brief flirtation with honest labor — I tossed about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! I’ll buy a Dilly Bar for anyone who lands his or her throw closer to the doorstep than I do. The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and you must fold them yourself (no rubber bands allowed). I’ll present a special prize to the 12-or-under contestant who makes the best toss. Deb Bosanek will be the judge.

At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at CenturyLink’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45 p.m. This business session typically lasts only a half hour or so.

Your venue for shopping will be the 194,300-square-foot hall that adjoins the meeting and in which products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries will be for sale. If you don’t get your shopping done on Friday, slip out while Charlie’s talking on Saturday and binge on our bargains. Check the terrific BNSF railroad layout also. Even though I’m 84, it still excites me.

Last year you did your part as a shopper, and most of our businesses racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period on Saturday, we sold 1,385 pairs of Justin boots (that’s a pair every 23 seconds), 13,440 pounds of See’s candy, 7,276 pairs of Wells Lamont work gloves and 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup. Heinz has a new mustard product, so both mustard and ketchup will be available this year. (Buy both!) Now that we are open for business on Friday as well, we expect new records in every precinct.

Brooks, our running-shoe company, will again have a special commemorative shoe to offer at the meeting. After you purchase a pair, wear them the next day at our third annual “Berkshire 5K,” an 8 a.m. race starting at the CenturyLink. Full details for participating will be included in the Visitor’s Guide that will be sent to you with your credentials for the meeting. Entrants in the race will find themselves running alongside many of Berkshire’s managers, directors and associates. (Charlie and I, however, will sleep in.)

A GEICO booth in the shopping area will be staffed by a number of the company’s top counselors from around the country. Stop by for a quote. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another discount, such as that available to certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out our price. We can save many of you real money.

Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry about 35 books and DVDs, among them a couple of new titles. Last year, many shareholders purchased Max Olson’s compilation of Berkshire letters going back to 1965, and he has produced an updated edition for the meeting. We also expect to be selling an inexpensive book commemorating our fifty years. It’s currently a work in process, but I expect it to contain a wide variety of historical material, including documents from the 19th Century.

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the credential you will need for admission to both the meeting and other events. Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs. Omaha. The drive between the two cities is about 2½ hours, and it may be that Kansas City can save you significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha. The savings for a couple could run to $1,000 or more. Spend that money with us.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the week surrounding the meeting, the store did a record $40,481,817 of business. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store is about $9 million.)

To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, April 28th and Monday, May 4th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday. From 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturday, NFM is having a picnic to which you are all invited.

At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 1st. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 3rd, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will remain open until 6 p.m. In recent years, our three-day volume has far exceeded our sales in all of December, normally a jeweler’s best month.

We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 27th through Saturday, May 9th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder.

On Sunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, Norman Beck, a remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of the world’s top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. Don’t play them for money.

My friend, Ariel Hsing, will be in the mall as well on Sunday, taking on challengers at table tennis. I met Ariel when she was nine and even then I was unable to score a point against her. Now, she’s a sophomore at Princeton, having already represented the United States in the 2012 Olympics. If you don’t mind embarrassing yourself, test your skills against her, beginning at 1 p.m. Bill Gates and I will lead off and try to soften her up.

Gorat’s and Piccolo’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 3rd. Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat’s opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo’s opening at 4 p.m. These restaurants are my favorites, and I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before); for Piccolo’s, call 402-346-2865. At Piccolo’s, order a giant root beer float for dessert. Only sissies get the small one.

We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, who retired last year after sixty years at Fortune, but remains the

From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the six he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than two questions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your question is asked.)

We will also have a panel of three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will be Gary Ransom of Dowling & Partners. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hope is that the analysts and journalists will ask questions that add to our owners’ understanding and knowledge of their investment.

Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough, for sure, and that’s the way we like it. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for 18 from the audience. (Last year we had 62 in total.) The questioners from the audience will be chosen by means of 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installed in the arena and main overflow room will host, so to speak, a drawing.

While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and should also have adequate time to analyze it. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We do not talk one-on-one to large institutional investors or analysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders.

************

We get terrific help at meeting time from literally thousands of Omaha residents and businesses who want you to enjoy yourselves. This year, because we expect record attendance, we have worried about a shortage of hotel rooms. To deal with that possible problem, Airbnb is making a special effort to obtain listings for the period around meeting time and is likely to have a wide array of accommodations to offer. Airbnb’s services may be especially helpful to shareholders who expect to spend only a single night in Omaha and are aware that last year a few hotels required guests to pay for a minimum of three nights. That gets expensive. Those people on a tight budget should check the Airbnb website.

************

For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I believe the mindset of our managers also to be as shareholder-oriented as can be found in the universe of large publicly-owned companies. Most of our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as their paycheck.

Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 24,100-page Federal income tax return and oversees the filing of 3,400 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities — and the list goes on and on.

They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy and pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work every day.

Last year, for the annual report, we dropped our 48-year-old “no pictures” policy — who says I’m not flexible? — and ran a photo of our remarkable home-office crew that was taken at our Christmas lunch. I didn’t warn the gang of the public exposure they were to receive, so they didn’t have on their Sunday best. This year was a different story: On the facing page you will see what our group looks like when they think someone will be noticing. However they dress, their performance is mind-boggling.

Come meet them on May 2nd and enjoy our Woodstock for Capitalists.

February 27, 2015
Warren E. Buffett

Chairman of the BoardBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.ACQUISITION CRITERIA We are eager to hear from principals or their representatives about businesses that meet all of the following criteria:Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units), Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are “turnaround” situations), Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt,  Management in place (we can’t supply it),  Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it),  An offering price (we don’t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction when price is unknown). The larger the company, the greater will be our interest: We would like to make an acquisition in the $5-20 billion range. We are not interested, however, in receiving suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock market.

We will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise complete confidentiality and a very fast answer — customarily within five minutes — as to whether we’re interested. We prefer to buy for cash, but will consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic business value as we give. We don’t participate in auctions.

Charlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions that don’t come close to meeting our tests: We’ve found that if you advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a country song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds, or auction-like sales: “When the phone don’t ring, you’ll know it’s me.”Berkshire — Past, Present and Future In the BeginningOn May 6, 1964, Berkshire Hathaway, then run by a man named Seabury Stanton, sent a letter to its shareholders offering to buy 225,000 shares of its stock for $11.375 per share. I had expected the letter; I was surprised by the price.

Berkshire then had 1,583,680 shares outstanding. About 7% of these were owned by Buffett Partnership Ltd. (“BPL”), an investing entity that I managed and in which I had virtually all of my net worth. Shortly before the tender offer was mailed, Stanton had asked me at what price BPL would sell its holdings. I answered $11.50, and he said, “Fine, we have a deal.” Then came Berkshire’s letter, offering an eighth of a point less. I bristled at Stanton’s behavior and didn’t tender.

That was a monumentally stupid decision.

Berkshire was then a northern textile manufacturer mired in a terrible business. The industry in which it operated was heading south, both metaphorically and physically. And Berkshire, for a variety of reasons, was unable to change course.

That was true even though the industry’s problems had long been widely understood. Berkshire’s own Board minutes of July 29, 1954, laid out the grim facts: “The textile industry in New England started going out of business forty years ago. During the war years this trend was stopped. The trend must continue until supply and demand have been balanced.”

About a year after that board meeting, Berkshire Fine Spinning Associates and Hathaway Manufacturing — both with roots in the 19th Century — joined forces, taking the name we bear today. With its fourteen plants and 10,000 employees, the merged company became the giant of New England textiles. What the two managements viewed as a merger agreement, however, soon morphed into a suicide pact. During the seven years following the consolidation, Berkshire operated at an overall loss, and its net worth shrunk by 37%.

Meanwhile, the company closed nine plants, sometimes using the liquidation proceeds to repurchase shares. And that pattern caught my attention.

I purchased BPL’s first shares of Berkshire in December 1962, anticipating more closings and more repurchases. The stock was then selling for $7.50, a wide discount from per-share working capital of $10.25 and book value of $20.20. Buying the stock at that price was like picking up a discarded cigar butt that had one puff remaining in it. Though the stub might be ugly and soggy, the puff would be free. Once that momentary pleasure was enjoyed, however, no more could be expected.

Berkshire thereafter stuck to the script: It soon closed another two plants, and in that May 1964 move, set out to repurchase shares with the shutdown proceeds. The price that Stanton offered was 50% above the cost of our original purchases. There it was — my free puff, just waiting for me, after which I could look elsewhere for other discarded butts.

Instead, irritated by Stanton’s chiseling, I ignored his offer and began to aggressively buy more Berkshire shares.

By April 1965, BPL owned 392,633 shares (out of 1,017,547 then outstanding) and at an early-May board meeting we formally took control of the company. Through Seabury’s and my childish behavior — after all, what was an eighth of a point to either of us? — he lost his job, and I found myself with more than 25% of BPL’s capital invested in a terrible business about which I knew very little. I became the dog who caught the car.

Because of Berkshire’s operating losses and share repurchases, its net worth at the end of fiscal 1964 had fallen to $22 million from $55 million at the time of the 1955 merger. The full $22 million was required by the textile operation: The company had no excess cash and owed its bank $2.5 million. (Berkshire’s 1964 annual report is reproduced on pages 130-142.)

For a time I got lucky: Berkshire immediately enjoyed two years of good operating conditions. Better yet, its earnings in those years were free of income tax because it possessed a large loss carry-forward that had arisen from the disastrous results in earlier years.

Then the honeymoon ended. During the 18 years following 1966, we struggled unremittingly with the textile business, all to no avail. But stubbornness — stupidity? — has its limits. In 1985, I finally threw in the towel and closed the operation.

************

Undeterred by my first mistake of committing much of BPL’s resources to a dying business, I quickly compounded the error. Indeed, my second blunder was far more serious than the first, eventually becoming the most costly in my career.

Early in 1967, I had Berkshire pay $8.6 million to buy National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a small but promising Omaha-based insurer. (A tiny sister company was also included in the deal.) Insurance was in my sweet spot: I understood and liked the industry.

Jack Ringwalt, the owner of NICO, was a long-time friend who wanted to sell to me — me, personally. In no way was his offer intended for Berkshire. So why did I purchase NICO for Berkshire rather than for BPL? I’ve had 48 years to think about that question, and I’ve yet to come up with a good answer. I simply made a colossal mistake.

If BPL had been the purchaser, my partners and I would have owned 100% of a fine business, destined to form the base for building the company Berkshire has become. Moreover, our growth would not have been impeded for nearly two decades by the unproductive funds imprisoned in the textile operation. Finally, our subsequent acquisitions would have been owned in their entirety by my partners and me rather than being 39%-owned by the legacy shareholders of Berkshire, to whom we had no obligation. Despite these facts staring me in the face, I opted to marry 100% of an excellent business (NICO) to a 61%-owned terrible business (Berkshire Hathaway), a decision that eventually diverted $100 billion or so from BPL partners to a collection of strangers.

************

One more confession and then I’ll go on to more pleasant topics: Can you believe that in 1975 I bought Waumbec Mills, another New England textile company? Of course, the purchase price was a “bargain” based on the assets we received and the projected synergies with Berkshire’s existing textile business. Nevertheless — surprise, surprise — Waumbec was a disaster, with the mill having to be closed down not many years later.

And now some good news: The northern textile industry is finally extinct. You need no longer panic if you hear that I’ve been spotted wandering around New England.Charlie Straightens Me Out My cigar-butt strategy worked very well while I was managing small sums. Indeed, the many dozens of free puffs I obtained in the 1950s made that decade by far the best of my life for both relative and absolute investment performance.

Even then, however, I made a few exceptions to cigar butts, the most important being GEICO. Thanks to a 1951 conversation I had with Lorimer Davidson, a wonderful man who later became CEO of the company, I learned that GEICO was a terrific business and promptly put 65% of my $9,800 net worth into its shares. Most of my gains in those early years, though, came from investments in mediocre companies that traded at bargain prices. Ben Graham had taught me that technique, and it worked.

But a major weakness in this approach gradually became apparent: Cigar-butt investing was scalable only to a point. With large sums, it would never work well.

In addition, though marginal businesses purchased at cheap prices may be attractive as short-term investments, they are the wrong foundation on which to build a large and enduring enterprise. Selecting a marriage partner clearly requires more demanding criteria than does dating. (Berkshire, it should be noted, would have been a highly satisfactory “date”: If we had taken Seabury Stanton’s $11.375 offer for our shares, BPL’s weighted annual return on its Berkshire investment would have been about 40%.)

************

It took Charlie Munger to break my cigar-butt habits and set the course for building a business that could combine huge size with satisfactory profits. Charlie had grown up a few hundred feet from where I now live and as a youth had worked, as did I, in my grandfather’s grocery store. Nevertheless, it was 1959 before I met Charlie, long after he had left Omaha to make Los Angeles his home. I was then 28 and he was 35. The Omaha doctor who introduced us predicted that we would hit it off — and we did.

If you’ve attended our annual meetings, you know Charlie has a wide-ranging brilliance, a prodigious memory, and some firm opinions. I’m not exactly wishy-washy myself, and we sometimes don’t agree. In 56 years, however, we’ve never had an argument. When we differ, Charlie usually ends the conversation by saying: “Warren, think it over and you’ll agree with me because you’re smart and I’m right.”

What most of you do not know about Charlie is that architecture is among his passions. Though he began his career as a practicing lawyer (with his time billed at $15 per hour), Charlie made his first real money in his 30s by designing and building five apartment projects near Los Angeles. Concurrently, he designed the house that he lives in today — some 55 years later. (Like me, Charlie can’t be budged if he is happy in his surroundings.) In recent years, Charlie has designed large dorm complexes at Stanford and the University of Michigan and today, at age 91, is working on another major project.

From my perspective, though, Charlie’s most important architectural feat was the design of today’s Berkshire. The blueprint he gave me was simple: Forget what you know about buying fair businesses at wonderful prices; instead, buy wonderful businesses at fair prices.

Altering my behavior is not an easy task (ask my family). I had enjoyed reasonable success without Charlie’s input, so why should I listen to a lawyer who had never spent a day in business school (when — ahem — I had attended three). But Charlie never tired of repeating his maxims about business and investing to me, and his logic was irrefutable. Consequently, Berkshire has been built to Charlie’s blueprint. My role has been that of general contractor, with the CEOs of Berkshire’s subsidiaries doing the real work as sub-contractors.

The year 1972 was a turning point for Berkshire (though not without occasional backsliding on my part — remember my 1975 purchase of Waumbec). We had the opportunity then to buy See’s Candy for Blue Chip Stamps, a company in which Charlie, I and Berkshire had major stakes, and which was later merged into Berkshire.

See’s was a legendary West Coast manufacturer and retailer of boxed chocolates, then annually earning about $4 million pre-tax while utilizing only $8 million of net tangible assets. Moreover, the company had a huge asset that did not appear on its balance sheet: a broad and durable competitive advantage that gave it significant pricing power. That strength was virtually certain to give See’s major gains in earnings over time. Better yet, these would materialize with only minor amounts of incremental investment. In other words, See’s could be expected to gush cash for decades to come.

The family controlling See’s wanted $30 million for the business, and Charlie rightly said it was worth that much. But I didn’t want to pay more than $25 million and wasn’t all that enthusiastic even at that figure. (A price that was three times net tangible assets made me gulp.) My misguided caution could have scuttled a terrific purchase. But, luckily, the sellers decided to take our $25 million bid.

To date, See’s has earned $1.9 billion pre-tax, with its growth having required added investment of only $40 million. See’s has thus been able to distribute huge sums that have helped Berkshire buy other businesses that, in turn, have themselves produced large distributable profits. (Envision rabbits breeding.) Additionally, through watching See’s in action, I gained a business education about the value of powerful brands that opened my eyes to many other profitable investments.

************

Even with Charlie’s blueprint, I have made plenty of mistakes since Waumbec. The most gruesome was Dexter Shoe. When we purchased the company in 1993, it had a terrific record and in no way looked to me like a cigar butt. Its competitive strengths, however, were soon to evaporate because of foreign competition. And I simply didn’t see that coming.

Consequently, Berkshire paid $433 million for Dexter and, rather promptly, its value went to zero. GAAP accounting, however, doesn’t come close to recording the magnitude of my error. The fact is that I gave Berkshire stock to the sellers of Dexter rather than cash, and the shares I used for the purchase are now worth about $5.7 billion. As a financial disaster, this one deserves a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Several of my subsequent errors also involved the use of Berkshire shares to purchase businesses whose earnings were destined to simply limp along. Mistakes of that kind are deadly. Trading shares of a wonderful business — which Berkshire most certainly is — for ownership of a so-so business irreparably destroys value.

We’ve also suffered financially when this mistake has been committed by companies whose shares Berkshire has owned (with the errors sometimes occurring while I was serving as a director). Too often CEOs seem blind to an elementary reality: The intrinsic value of the shares you give in an acquisition must not be greater than the intrinsic value of the business you receive.

I’ve yet to see an investment banker quantify this all-important math when he is presenting a stock-forstock deal to the board of a potential acquirer. Instead, the banker’s focus will be on describing “customary” premiums-to-market-price that are currently being paid for acquisitions — an absolutely asinine way to evaluate the attractiveness of an acquisition — or whether the deal will increase the acquirer’s earnings-per-share (which in itself should be far from determinative). In striving to achieve the desired per-share number, a panting CEO and his “helpers” will often conjure up fanciful “synergies.” (As a director of 19 companies over the years, I’ve never heard “dis-synergies” mentioned, though I’ve witnessed plenty of these once deals have closed.) Post mortems of acquisitions, in which reality is honestly compared to the original projections, are rare in American boardrooms. They should instead be standard practice.

I can promise you that long after I’m gone, Berkshire’s CEO and Board will carefully make intrinsic value calculations before issuing shares in any acquisitions. You can’t get rich trading a hundred-dollar bill for eight tens (even if your advisor has handed you an expensive “fairness” opinion endorsing that swap).

************

Overall, Berkshire’s acquisitions have worked out well — and very well in the case of a few large ones. So, too, have our investments in marketable securities. The latter are always valued on our balance sheet at their market prices so any gains — including those unrealized — are immediately reflected in our net worth. But the businesses we buy outright are never revalued upward on our balance sheet, even when we could sell them for many billions of dollars more than their carrying value. The unrecorded gains in the value of Berkshire’s subsidiaries have become huge, with these growing at a particularly fast pace in the last decade.

Listening to Charlie has paid off.Berkshire Today Berkshire is now a sprawling conglomerate, constantly trying to sprawl further.

Conglomerates, it should be acknowledged, have a terrible reputation with investors. And they richly deserve it. Let me first explain why they are in the doghouse, and then I will go on to describe why the conglomerate form brings huge and enduring advantages to Berkshire.

Since I entered the business world, conglomerates have enjoyed several periods of extreme popularity, the silliest of which occurred in the late 1960s. The drill for conglomerate CEOs then was simple: By personality, promotion or dubious accounting — and often by all three — these managers drove a fledgling conglomerate’s stock to, say, 20 times earnings and then issued shares as fast as possible to acquire another business selling at ten-or-so times earnings. They immediately applied “pooling” accounting to the acquisition, which — with not a dime’s worth of change in the underlying businesses — automatically increased per-share earnings, and used the rise as proof of managerial genius. They next explained to investors that this sort of talent justified the maintenance, or even the enhancement, of the acquirer’s p/e multiple. And, finally, they promised to endlessly repeat this procedure and thereby create ever-increasing per-share earnings.

Wall Street’s love affair with this hocus-pocus intensified as the 1960s rolled by. The Street’s denizens are always ready to suspend disbelief when dubious maneuvers are used to manufacture rising per-share earnings, particularly if these acrobatics produce mergers that generate huge fees for investment bankers. Auditors willingly sprinkled their holy water on the conglomerates’ accounting and sometimes even made suggestions as to how to further juice the numbers. For many, gushers of easy money washed away ethical sensitivities.

Since the per-share earnings gains of an expanding conglomerate came from exploiting p/e differences, its CEO had to search for businesses selling at low multiples of earnings. These, of course, were characteristically mediocre businesses with poor long-term prospects. This incentive to bottom-fish usually led to a conglomerate’s collection of underlying businesses becoming more and more junky. That mattered little to investors: It was deal velocity and pooling accounting they looked to for increased earnings.

The resulting firestorm of merger activity was fanned by an adoring press. Companies such as ITT, Litton Industries, Gulf & Western, and LTV were lionized, and their CEOs became celebrities. (These once-famous conglomerates are now long gone. As Yogi Berra said, “Every Napoleon meets his Watergate.”)

Back then, accounting shenanigans of all sorts — many of them ridiculously transparent — were excused or overlooked. Indeed, having an accounting wizard at the helm of an expanding conglomerate was viewed as a huge plus: Shareholders in those instances could be sure that reported earnings would never disappoint, no matter how bad the operating realities of the business might become.

In the late 1960s, I attended a meeting at which an acquisitive CEO bragged of his “bold, imaginative accounting.” Most of the analysts listening responded with approving nods, seeing themselves as having found a manager whose forecasts were certain to be met, whatever the business results might be.

Eventually, however, the clock struck twelve, and everything turned to pumpkins and mice. Once again, it became evident that business models based on the serial issuances of overpriced shares — just like chain-letter models — most assuredly redistribute wealth, but in no way create it. Both phenomena, nevertheless, periodically blossom in our country — they are every promoter’s dream — though often they appear in a carefully-crafted disguise. The ending is always the same: Money flows from the gullible to the fraudster. And with stocks, unlike chain letters, the sums hijacked can be staggering.

At both BPL and Berkshire, we have never invested in companies that are hell-bent on issuing shares. That behavior is one of the surest indicators of a promotion-minded management, weak accounting, a stock that is overpriced and — all too often — outright dishonesty.

************

So what do Charlie and I find so attractive about Berkshire’s conglomerate structure? To put the case simply: If the conglomerate form is used judiciously, it is an ideal structure for maximizing long-term capital growth.

One of the heralded virtues of capitalism is that it efficiently allocates funds. The argument is that markets will direct investment to promising businesses and deny it to those destined to wither. That is true: With all its excesses, market-driven allocation of capital is usually far superior to any alternative.

Nevertheless, there are often obstacles to the rational movement of capital. As those 1954 Berkshire minutes made clear, capital withdrawals within the textile industry that should have been obvious were delayed for decades because of the vain hopes and self-interest of managements. Indeed, I myself delayed abandoning our obsolete textile mills for far too long.

A CEO with capital employed in a declining operation seldom elects to massively redeploy that capital into unrelated activities. A move of that kind would usually require that long-time associates be fired and mistakes be admitted. Moreover, it’s unlikely that CEO would be the manager you would wish to handle the redeployment job even if he or she was inclined to undertake it.

At the shareholder level, taxes and frictional costs weigh heavily on individual investors when they attempt to reallocate capital among businesses and industries. Even tax-free institutional investors face major costs as they move capital because they usually need intermediaries to do this job. A lot of mouths with expensive tastes then clamor to be fed — among them investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and such capital-reallocators as leveraged buyout operators. Money-shufflers don’t come cheap.

In contrast, a conglomerate such as Berkshire is perfectly positioned to allocate capital rationally and at minimal cost. Of course, form itself is no guarantee of success: We have made plenty of mistakes, and we will make more. Our structural advantages, however, are formidable.

At Berkshire, we can — without incurring taxes or much in the way of other costs — move huge sums from businesses that have limited opportunities for incremental investment to other sectors with greater promise. Moreover, we are free of historical biases created by lifelong association with a given industry and are not subject to pressures from colleagues having a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. That’s important: If horses had controlled investment decisions, there would have been no auto industry.

Another major advantage we possess is the ability to buy pieces of wonderful businesses — a.k.a. common stocks. That’s not a course of action open to most managements. Over our history, this strategic alternative has proved to be very helpful; a broad range of options always sharpens decision-making. The businesses we are offered by the stock market every day — in small pieces, to be sure — are often far more attractive than the businesses we are concurrently being offered in their entirety. Additionally, the gains we’ve realized from marketable securities have helped us make certain large acquisitions that would otherwise have been beyond our financial capabilities.

In effect, the world is Berkshire’s oyster — a world offering us a range of opportunities far beyond those realistically open to most companies. We are limited, of course, to businesses whose economic prospects we can evaluate. And that’s a serious limitation: Charlie and I have no idea what a great many companies will look like ten years from now. But that limitation is much smaller than that borne by an executive whose experience has been confined to a single industry. On top of that, we can profitably scale to a far larger size than the many businesses that are constrained by the limited potential of the single industry in which they operate.

I mentioned earlier that See’s Candy had produced huge earnings compared to its modest capital requirements. We would have loved, of course, to intelligently use those funds to expand our candy operation. But our many attempts to do so were largely futile. So, without incurring tax inefficiencies or frictional costs, we have used the excess funds generated by See’s to help purchase other businesses. If See’s had remained a stand-alone company, its earnings would have had to be distributed to investors to redeploy, sometimes after being heavily depleted by large taxes and, almost always, by significant frictional and agency costs.

************

Berkshire has one further advantage that has become increasingly important over the years: We are now the home of choice for the owners and managers of many outstanding businesses.

Families that own successful businesses have multiple options when they contemplate sale. Frequently, the best decision is to do nothing. There are worse things in life than having a prosperous business that one understands well. But sitting tight is seldom recommended by Wall Street. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.)

When one part of a family wishes to sell while others wish to continue, a public offering often makes sense. But, when owners wish to cash out entirely, they usually consider one of two paths.

The first is sale to a competitor who is salivating at the possibility of wringing “synergies” from the combining of the two companies. This buyer invariably contemplates getting rid of large numbers of the seller’s associates, the very people who have helped the owner build his business. A caring owner, however — and there are plenty of them — usually does not want to leave his long-time associates sadly singing the old country song: “She got the goldmine, I got the shaft.”

The second choice for sellers is the Wall Street buyer. For some years, these purchasers accurately called themselves “leveraged buyout firms.” When that term got a bad name in the early 1990s — remember RJR and Barbarians at the Gate? — these buyers hastily relabeled themselves “private-equity.”

The name may have changed but that was all: Equity is dramatically reduced and debt is piled on in virtually all private-equity purchases. Indeed, the amount that a private-equity purchaser offers to the seller is in part determined by the buyer assessing the maximum amount of debt that can be placed on the acquired company.

Later, if things go well and equity begins to build, leveraged buy-out shops will often seek to re-leverage with new borrowings. They then typically use part of the proceeds to pay a huge dividend that drives equity sharply downward, sometimes even to a negative figure.

In truth, “equity” is a dirty word for many private-equity buyers; what they love is debt. And, because debt is currently so inexpensive, these buyers can frequently pay top dollar. Later, the business will be resold, often to another leveraged buyer. In effect, the business becomes a piece of merchandise.

Berkshire offers a third choice to the business owner who wishes to sell: a permanent home, in which the company’s people and culture will be retained (though, occasionally, management changes will be needed). Beyond that, any business we acquire dramatically increases its financial strength and ability to grow. Its days of dealing with banks and Wall Street analysts are also forever ended.

Some sellers don’t care about these matters. But, when sellers do, Berkshire does not have a lot of competition.

************

Sometimes pundits propose that Berkshire spin-off certain of its businesses. These suggestions make no sense. Our companies are worth more as part of Berkshire than as separate entities. One reason is our ability to move funds between businesses or into new ventures instantly and without tax. In addition, certain costs duplicate themselves, in full or part, if operations are separated. Here’s the most obvious example: Berkshire incurs nominal costs for its single board of directors; were our dozens of subsidiaries to be split off, the overall cost for directors would soar. So, too, would regulatory and administration expenditures.

Finally, there are sometimes important tax efficiencies for Subsidiary A because we own Subsidiary B. For example, certain tax credits that are available to our utilities are currently realizable only because we generate huge amounts of taxable income at other Berkshire operations. That gives Berkshire Hathaway Energy a major advantage over most public-utility companies in developing wind and solar projects.

Investment bankers, being paid as they are for action, constantly urge acquirers to pay 20% to 50% premiums over market price for publicly-held businesses. The bankers tell the buyer that the premium is justified for “control value” and for the wonderful things that are going to happen once the acquirer’s CEO takes charge. (What acquisition-hungry manager will challenge that assertion?)

A few years later, bankers — bearing straight faces — again appear and just as earnestly urge spinning off the earlier acquisition in order to “unlock shareholder value.” Spin-offs, of course, strip the owning company of its purported “control value” without any compensating payment. The bankers explain that the spun-off company will flourish because its management will be more entrepreneurial, having been freed from the smothering bureaucracy of the parent company. (So much for that talented CEO we met earlier.)

If the divesting company later wishes to reacquire the spun-off operation, it presumably would again be urged by its bankers to pay a hefty “control” premium for the privilege. (Mental “flexibility” of this sort by the banking fraternity has prompted the saying that fees too often lead to transactions rather than transactions leading to fees.)

It’s possible, of course, that someday a spin-off or sale at Berkshire would be required by regulators. Berkshire carried out such a spin-off in 1979, when new regulations for bank holding companies forced us to divest a bank we owned in Rockford, Illinois.

Voluntary spin-offs, though, make no sense for us: We would lose control value, capital-allocation flexibility and, in some cases, important tax advantages. The CEOs who brilliantly run our subsidiaries now would have difficulty in being as effective if running a spun-off operation, given the operating and financial advantages derived from Berkshire’s ownership. Moreover, the parent and the spun-off operations, once separated, would likely incur moderately greater costs than existed when they were combined.

************

Before I depart the subject of spin-offs, let’s look at a lesson to be learned from a conglomerate mentioned earlier: LTV. I’ll summarize here, but those who enjoy a good financial story should read the piece about Jimmy Ling that ran in the October 1982 issue of D Magazine. Look it up on the Internet.

Through a lot of corporate razzle-dazzle, Ling had taken LTV from sales of only $36 million in 1965 to number 14 on the Fortune 500 list just two years later. Ling, it should be noted, had never displayed any managerial skills. But Charlie told me long ago to never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. And Ling had no peer in that respect.

Ling’s strategy, which he labeled “project redeployment,” was to buy a large company and then partially spin off its various divisions. In LTV’s 1966 annual report, he explained the magic that would follow: “Most importantly, acquisitions must meet the test of the 2 plus 2 equals 5 (or 6) formula.” The press, the public and Wall Street loved this sort of talk.

In 1967 Ling bought Wilson & Co., a huge meatpacker that also had interests in golf equipment and pharmaceuticals. Soon after, he split the parent into three businesses, Wilson & Co. (meatpacking), Wilson Sporting Goods and Wilson Pharmaceuticals, each of which was to be partially spun off. These companies quickly became known on Wall Street as Meatball, Golf Ball and Goof Ball.

Soon thereafter, it became clear that, like Icarus, Ling had flown too close to the sun. By the early 1970s, Ling’s empire was melting, and he himself had been spun off from LTV . . . that is, fired.

Periodically, financial markets will become divorced from reality — you can count on that. More Jimmy Lings will appear. They will look and sound authoritative. The press will hang on their every word. Bankers will fight for their business. What they are saying will recently have “worked.” Their early followers will be feeling very clever. Our suggestion: Whatever their line, never forget that 2+2 will always equal 4. And when someone tells you how old-fashioned that math is ---zip up your wallet, take a vacation and come back in a few years to buy stocks at cheap prices.

************

Today Berkshire possesses (1) an unmatched collection of businesses, most of them now enjoying favorable economic prospects; (2) a cadre of outstanding managers who, with few exceptions, are unusually devoted to both the subsidiary they operate and to Berkshire; (3) an extraordinary diversity of earnings, premier financial strength and oceans of liquidity that we will maintain under all circumstances; (4) a first-choice ranking among many owners and managers who are contemplating sale of their businesses and (5) in a point related to the preceding item, a culture, distinctive in many ways from that of most large companies, that we have worked 50 years to develop and that is now rock-solid.

These strengths provide us a wonderful foundation on which to build.The Next 50 Years at Berkshire Now let’s take a look at the road ahead. Bear in mind that if I had attempted 50 years ago to gauge what was coming, certain of my predictions would have been far off the mark. With that warning, I will tell you what I would say to my family today if they asked me about Berkshire’s future.        First and definitely foremost, I believe that the chance of permanent capital loss for patient Berkshire shareholders is as low as can be found among single-company investments. That’s because our per-share intrinsic business value is almost certain to advance over time.

This cheery prediction comes, however, with an important caution: If an investor’s entry point into Berkshire stock is unusually high — at a price, say, approaching double book value, which Berkshire shares have occasionally reached — it may well be many years before the investor can realize a profit. In other words, a sound investment can morph into a rash speculation if it is bought at an elevated price. Berkshire is not exempt from this truth.

Purchases of Berkshire that investors make at a price modestly above the level at which the company would repurchase its shares, however, should produce gains within a reasonable period of time. Berkshire’s directors will only authorize repurchases at a price they believe to be well below intrinsic value. (In our view, that is an essential criterion for repurchases that is often ignored by other managements.)

For those investors who plan to sell within a year or two after their purchase, I can offer no assurances, whatever the entry price. Movements of the general stock market during such abbreviated periods will likely be far more important in determining your results than the concomitant change in the intrinsic value of your Berkshire shares. As Ben Graham said many decades ago: “In the short-term the market is a voting machine; in the long-run it acts as a weighing machine.” Occasionally, the voting decisions of investors — amateurs and professionals alike — border on lunacy.

Since I know of no way to reliably predict market movements, I recommend that you purchase Berkshire shares only if you expect to hold them for at least five years. Those who seek short-term profits should look elsewhere.

Another warning: Berkshire shares should not be purchased with borrowed money. There have been three times since 1965 when our stock has fallen about 50% from its high point. Someday, something close to this kind of drop will happen again, and no one knows when. Berkshire will almost certainly be a satisfactory holding for investors. But it could well be a disastrous choice for speculators employing leverage.             I believe the chance of any event causing Berkshire to experience financial problems is essentially zero. We will always be prepared for the thousand-year flood; in fact, if it occurs we will be selling life jackets to the unprepared. Berkshire played an important role as a “first responder” during the 2008-2009 meltdown, and we have since more than doubled the strength of our balance sheet and our earnings potential. Your company is the Gibraltar of American business and will remain so.

Financial staying power requires a company to maintain three strengths under all circumstances: (1) a large and reliable stream of earnings; (2) massive liquid assets and (3) no significant near-term cash requirements. Ignoring that last necessity is what usually leads companies to experience unexpected problems: Too often, CEOs of profitable companies feel they will always be able to refund maturing obligations, however large these are. In 2008-2009, many managements learned how perilous that mindset can be.

Here’s how we will always stand on the three essentials. First, our earnings stream is huge and comes from a vast array of businesses. Our shareholders now own many large companies that have durable competitive advantages, and we will acquire more of those in the future. Our diversification assures Berkshire’s continued profitability, even if a catastrophe causes insurance losses that far exceed any previously experienced.

Next up is cash. At a healthy business, cash is sometimes thought of as something to be minimized — as an unproductive asset that acts as a drag on such markers as return on equity. Cash, though, is to a business as oxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present, the only thing in mind when it is absent.

American business provided a case study of that in 2008. In September of that year, many long-prosperous companies suddenly wondered whether their checks would bounce in the days ahead. Overnight, their financial oxygen disappeared.

At Berkshire, our “breathing” went uninterrupted. Indeed, in a three-week period spanning late September and early October, we supplied $15.6 billion of fresh money to American businesses.

We could do that because we always maintain at least $20 billion — and usually far more — in cash equivalents. And by that we mean U.S. Treasury bills, not other substitutes for cash that are claimed to deliver liquidity and actually do so, except when it is truly needed. When bills come due, only cash is legal tender. Don’t leave home without it.

Finally — getting to our third point — we will never engage in operating or investment practices that can result in sudden demands for large sums. That means we will not expose Berkshire to short-term debt maturities of size nor enter into derivative contracts or other business arrangements that could require large collateral calls.

Some years ago, we became a party to certain derivative contracts that we believed were significantly mispriced and that had only minor collateral requirements. These have proved to be quite profitable. Recently, however, newly-written derivative contracts have required full collateralization. And that ended our interest in derivatives, regardless of what profit potential they might offer. We have not, for some years, written these contracts, except for a few needed for operational purposes at our utility businesses.

Moreover, we will not write insurance contracts that give policyholders the right to cash out at their option. Many life insurance products contain redemption features that make them susceptible to a “run” in times of extreme panic. Contracts of that sort, however, do not exist in the property-casualty world that we inhabit. If our premium volume should shrink, our float would decline — but only at a very slow pace.

The reason for our conservatism, which may impress some people as extreme, is that it is entirely predictable that people will occasionally panic, but not at all predictable when this will happen. Though practically all days are relatively uneventful, tomorrow is always uncertain. (I felt no special apprehension on December 6, 1941 or September 10, 2001.) And if you can’t predict what tomorrow will bring, you must be prepared for whatever it does.

A CEO who is 64 and plans to retire at 65 may have his own special calculus in evaluating risks that have only a tiny chance of happening in a given year. He may, in fact, be “right” 99% of the time. Those odds, however, hold no appeal for us. We will never play financial Russian roulette with the funds you’ve entrusted to us, even if the metaphorical gun has 100 chambers and only one bullet. In our view, it is madness to risk losing what you need in pursuing what you simply desire.             Despite our conservatism, I think we will be able every year to build the underlying per-share earning power of Berkshire. That does not mean operating earnings will increase each year — far from it. The U.S. economy will ebb and flow — though mostly flow — and, when it weakens, so will our current earnings. But we will continue to achieve organic gains, make bolt-on acquisitions and enter new fields. I believe, therefore, that Berkshire will annually add to its underlying earning power.

In some years the gains will be substantial, and at other times they will be minor. Markets, competition, and chance will determine when opportunities come our way. Through it all, Berkshire will keep moving forward, powered by the array of solid businesses we now possess and the new companies we will purchase. In most years, moreover, our country’s economy will provide a strong tailwind for business. We are blessed to have the United States as our home field.             The bad news is that Berkshire’s long-term gains — measured by percentages, not by dollars — cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years. The numbers have become too big. I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be great.

Eventually — probably between ten and twenty years from now — Berkshire’s earnings and capital resources will reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company’s earnings. At that time our directors will need to determine whether the best method to distribute the excess earnings is through dividends, share repurchases or both. If Berkshire shares are selling below intrinsic business value, massive repurchases will almost certainly be the best choice. You can be comfortable that your directors will make the right decision.             No company will be more shareholder-minded than Berkshire. For more than 30 years, we have annually reaffirmed our Shareholder Principles (see page 117), always leading off with: “Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership.” This covenant with you is etched in stone.

We have an extraordinarily knowledgeable and business-oriented board of directors ready to carry out that promise of partnership. None took the job for the money: In an arrangement almost non-existent elsewhere, our directors are paid only token fees. They receive their rewards instead through ownership of Berkshire shares and the satisfaction that comes from being good stewards of an important enterprise.

The shares that they and their families own — which, in many cases, are worth very substantial sums — were purchased in the market (rather than their materializing through options or grants). In addition, unlike almost all other sizable public companies, we carry no directors and officers liability insurance. At Berkshire, directors walk in your shoes.

To further ensure continuation of our culture, I have suggested that my son, Howard, succeed me as a non-executive Chairman. My only reason for this wish is to make change easier if the wrong CEO should ever be employed and there occurs a need for the Chairman to move forcefully. I can assure you that this problem has a very low probability of arising at Berkshire — likely as low as at any public company. In my service on the boards of nineteen public companies, however, I’ve seen how hard it is to replace a mediocre CEO if that person is also Chairman. (The deed usually gets done, but almost always very late.)

If elected, Howard will receive no pay and will spend no time at the job other than that required of all directors. He will simply be a safety valve to whom any director can go if he or she has concerns about the CEO and wishes to learn if other directors are expressing doubts as well. Should multiple directors be apprehensive, Howard’s chairmanship will allow the matter to be promptly and properly addressed.             Choosing the right CEO is all-important and is a subject that commands much time at Berkshire board meetings. Managing Berkshire is primarily a job of capital allocation, coupled with the selection and retention of outstanding managers to captain our operating subsidiaries. Obviously, the job also requires the replacement of a subsidiary’s CEO when that is called for. These duties require Berkshire’s CEO to be a rational, calm and decisive individual who has a broad understanding of business and good insights into human behavior. It’s important as well that he knows his limits. (As Tom Watson, Sr. of IBM said, “I’m no genius, but I’m smart in spots and I stay around those spots.”)

Character is crucial: A Berkshire CEO must be “all in” for the company, not for himself. (I’m using male pronouns to avoid awkward wording, but gender should never decide who becomes CEO.) He can’t help but earn money far in excess of any possible need for it. But it’s important that neither ego nor avarice motivate him to reach for pay matching his most lavishly-compensated peers, even if his achievements far exceed theirs. A CEO’s behavior has a huge impact on managers down the line: If it’s clear to them that shareholders’ interests are paramount to him, they will, with few exceptions, also embrace that way of thinking.

My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency. When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter. The examples available to prove the point are legion, but to maintain friendships I will exhume only cases from the distant past.

In their glory days, General Motors, IBM, Sears Roebuck and U.S. Steel sat atop huge industries. Their strengths seemed unassailable. But the destructive behavior I deplored above eventually led each of them to fall to depths that their CEOs and directors had not long before thought impossible. Their one-time financial strength and their historical earning power proved no defense.

Only a vigilant and determined CEO can ward off such debilitating forces as Berkshire grows ever larger. He must never forget Charlie’s plea: “Tell me where I’m going to die, so I’ll never go there.” If our noneconomic values were to be lost, much of Berkshire’s economic value would collapse as well. “Tone at the top” will be key to maintaining Berkshire’s special culture.

Fortunately, the structure our future CEOs will need to be successful is firmly in place. The extraordinary delegation of authority now existing at Berkshire is the ideal antidote to bureaucracy. In an operating sense, Berkshire is not a giant company but rather a collection of large companies. At headquarters, we have never had a committee nor have we ever required our subsidiaries to submit budgets (though many use them as an important internal tool). We don’t have a legal office nor departments that other companies take for granted: human relations, public relations, investor relations, strategy, acquisitions, you name it.

We do, of course, have an active audit function; no sense being a dammed fool. To an unusual degree, however, we trust our managers to run their operations with a keen sense of stewardship. After all, they were doing exactly that before we acquired their businesses. With only occasional exceptions, furthermore, our trust produces better results than would be achieved by streams of directives, endless reviews and layers of bureaucracy. Charlie and I try to interact with our managers in a manner consistent with what we would wish for, if the positions were reversed.             Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire board has grown to know well. Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job. Berkshire will operate best if its CEOs average well over ten years at the helm. (It’s hard to teach a new dog old tricks.) And they are not likely to retire at 65 either (or have you noticed?).

In both Berkshire’s business acquisitions and large, tailored investment moves, it is important that our counterparties be both familiar with and feel comfortable with Berkshire’s CEO. Developing confidence of that sort and cementing relationships takes time. The payoff, though, can be huge.

Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO — a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down. In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing.     Investments will always be of great importance to Berkshire and will be handled by several specialists. They will report to the CEO because their investment decisions, in a broad way, will need to be coordinated with Berkshire’s operating and acquisition programs. Overall, though, our investment managers will enjoy great autonomy. In this area, too, we are in fine shape for decades to come. Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, each of whom has spent several years on Berkshire’s investment team, are first-rate in all respects and can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions.

All told, Berkshire is ideally positioned for life after Charlie and I leave the scene. We have the right people in place — the right directors, managers and prospective successors to those managers. Our culture, furthermore, is embedded throughout their ranks. Our system is also regenerative. To a large degree, both good and bad cultures self-select to perpetuate themselves. For very good reasons, business owners and operating managers with values similar to ours will continue to be attracted to Berkshire as a one-of-a-kind and permanent home.    I would be remiss if I didn’t salute another key constituency that makes Berkshire special: our shareholders. Berkshire truly has an owner base unlike that of any other giant corporation. That fact was demonstrated in spades at last year’s annual meeting, where the shareholders were offered a proxy resolution:

    RESOLVED: Whereas the corporation has more money than it needs and since the owners unlike Warren are not multi billionaires, the board shall consider paying a meaningful annual dividend on the shares.

The sponsoring shareholder of that resolution never showed up at the meeting, so his motion was not officially proposed. Nevertheless, the proxy votes had been tallied, and they were enlightening.

Not surprisingly, the A shares — owned by relatively few shareholders, each with a large economic interest — voted “no” on the dividend question by a margin of 89 to 1.

The remarkable vote was that of our B shareholders. They number in the hundreds of thousands — perhaps even totaling one million — and they voted 660,759,855 “no” and 13,927,026 “yes,” a ratio of about 47 to 1.

Our directors recommended a “no” vote but the company did not otherwise attempt to influence shareholders. Nevertheless, 98% of the shares voting said, in effect, “Don’t send us a dividend but instead reinvest all of the earnings.” To have our fellow owners — large and small — be so in sync with our managerial philosophy is both remarkable and rewarding.

I am a lucky fellow to have you as partners.    Warren E. BuffettVice Chairman’s Thoughts — Past and Future To the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:

I closely watched the 50-year history of Berkshire’s uncommon success under Warren Buffett. And it now seems appropriate that I independently supplement whatever celebratory comment comes from him. I will try to do five things.Describe the management system and policies that caused a small and unfixably-doomed commodity textile business to morph into the mighty Berkshire that now exists,  Explain how the management system and policies came into being,  Explain, to some extent, why Berkshire did so well,  Predict whether abnormally good results would continue if Buffett were soon to depart, and  Consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful elsewhere. The management system and policies of Berkshire under Buffett (herein together called “the Berkshire system”) were fixed early and are described below:Berkshire would be a diffuse conglomerate, averse only to activities about which it could not make useful predictions. Its top company would do almost all business through separately incorporated subsidiaries whose CEOs would operate with very extreme autonomy. There would be almost nothing at conglomerate headquarters except a tiny office suite containing a Chairman, a CFO, and a few assistants who mostly helped the CFO with auditing, internal control, etc. Berkshire subsidiaries would always prominently include casualty insurers. Those insurers as a group would be expected to produce, in due course, dependable underwriting gains while also producing substantial “float” (from unpaid insurance liabilities) for investment. There would be no significant system-wide personnel system, stock option system, other incentive system, retirement system, or the like, because the subsidiaries would have their own systems, often different. Berkshire’s Chairman would reserve only a few activities for himself. He would manage almost all security investments, with these normally residing in Berkshire’s casualty insurers.  He would choose all CEOs of important subsidiaries, and he would fix their compensation and obtain from each a private recommendation for a successor in case one was suddenly needed.  He would deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.  He would make himself promptly available for almost any contact wanted by any subsidiary’s CEO, and he would require almost no additional contact.  He would write a long, logical, and useful letter for inclusion in his annual report, designed as he would wish it to be if he were only a passive shareholder, and he would be available for hours of answering questions at annual shareholders’ meetings.  He would try to be an exemplar in a culture that would work well for customers, shareholders, and other incumbents for a long time, both before and after his departure.  His first priority would be reservation of much time for quiet reading and thinking, particularly that which might advance his determined learning, no matter how old he became; and He would also spend much time in enthusiastically admiring what others were accomplishing.  New subsidiaries would usually be bought with cash, not newly issued stock. Berkshire would not pay dividends so long as more than one dollar of market value for shareholders was being created by each dollar of retained earnings. In buying a new subsidiary, Berkshire would seek to pay a fair price for a good business that the Chairman could pretty well understand. Berkshire would also want a good CEO in place, one expected to remain for a long time and to manage well without need for help from headquarters. In choosing CEOs of subsidiaries, Berkshire would try to secure trustworthiness, skill, energy, and love for the business and circumstances the CEO was in. As an important matter of preferred conduct, Berkshire would almost never sell a subsidiary. Berkshire would almost never transfer a subsidiary’s CEO to another unrelated subsidiary. Berkshire would never force the CEO of a subsidiary to retire on account of mere age. Berkshire would have little debt outstanding as it tried to maintain (i) virtually perfect creditworthiness under all conditions and (ii) easy availability of cash and credit for deployment in times presenting unusual opportunities. Berkshire would always be user-friendly to a prospective seller of a large business. An offer of such a business would get prompt attention. No one but the Chairman and one or two others at Berkshire would ever know about the offer if it did not lead to a transaction. And they would never tell outsiders about it.Both the elements of the Berkshire system and their collected size are quite unusual. No other large corporation I know of has half of such elements in place.

How did Berkshire happen to get a corporate personality so different from the norm?

Well, Buffett, even when only 34 years old, controlled about 45% of Berkshire’s shares and was completely trusted by all the other big shareholders. He could install whatever system he wanted. And he did so, creating the Berkshire system.

Almost every element was chosen because Buffett believed that, under him, it would help maximize Berkshire’s achievement. He was not trying to create a one-type-fits-all system for other corporations. Indeed, Berkshire’s subsidiaries were not required to use the Berkshire system in their own operations. And some flourished while using different systems.

What was Buffett aiming at as he designed the Berkshire system?

Well, over the years I diagnosed several important themes:He particularly wanted continuous maximization of the rationality, skills, and devotion of the most important people in the system, starting with himself.  He wanted win/win results everywhere—in gaining loyalty by giving it, for instance. He wanted decisions that maximized long-term results, seeking these from decision makers who usually stayed long enough in place to bear the consequences of decisions.  He wanted to minimize the bad effects that would almost inevitably come from a large bureaucracy at headquarters.  He wanted to personally contribute, like Professor Ben Graham, to the spread of wisdom attained. When Buffett developed the Berkshire system, did he foresee all the benefits that followed? No. Buffett stumbled into some benefits through practice evolution. But, when he saw useful consequences, he strengthened their causes.

Why did Berkshire under Buffett do so well? Only four large factors occur to me:The constructive peculiarities of Buffett, The constructive peculiarities of the Berkshire system,  Good luck, and The weirdly intense, contagious devotion of some shareholders and other admirers, including some in the press.I believe all four factors were present and helpful. But the heavy freight was carried by the constructive peculiarities, the weird devotion, and their interactions.

In particular, Buffett’s decision to limit his activities to a few kinds and to maximize his attention to them, and to keep doing so for 50 years, was a lollapalooza. Buffett succeeded for the same reason Roger Federer became good at tennis.

Buffett was, in effect, using the winning method of the famous basketball coach, John Wooden, who won most regularly after he had learned to assign virtually all playing time to his seven best players. That way, opponents always faced his best players, instead of his second best. And, with the extra playing time, the best players improved more than was normal.

And Buffett much out-Woodened Wooden, because in his case the exercise of skill was concentrated in one person, not seven, and his skill improved and improved as he got older and older during 50 years, instead of deteriorating like the skill of a basketball player does.

Moreover, by concentrating so much power and authority in the often-long-serving CEOs of important subsidiaries, Buffett was also creating strong Wooden-type effects there. And such effects enhanced the skills of the CEOs and the achievements of the subsidiaries.

Then, as the Berkshire system bestowed much-desired autonomy on many subsidiaries and their CEOs, and Berkshire became successful and well known, these outcomes attracted both more and better subsidiaries into Berkshire, and better CEOs as well.

And the better subsidiaries and CEOs then required less attention from headquarters, creating what is often called a “virtuous circle.”

How well did it work out for Berkshire to always include casualty insurers as important subsidiaries?

Marvelously well. Berkshire’s ambitions were unreasonably extreme and, even so, it got what it wanted.

Casualty insurers often invest in common stocks with a value amounting roughly to their shareholders’ equity, as did Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries. And the S&P 500 Index produced about 10% per annum, pre-tax, during the last 50 years, creating a significant tailwind.

And, in the early decades of the Buffett era, common stocks within Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries greatly outperformed the index, exactly as Buffett expected. And, later, when both the large size of Berkshire’s stockholdings and income tax considerations caused the index-beating part of returns to fade to insignificance (perhaps not forever), other and better advantage came. Ajit Jain created out of nothing an immense reinsurance business that produced both a huge “float” and a large underwriting gain. And all of GEICO came into Berkshire, followed by a quadrupling of GEICO’s market share. And the rest of Berkshire’s insurance operations hugely improved, largely by dint of reputational advantage, underwriting discipline, finding and staying within good niches, and recruiting and holding outstanding people.

Then, later, as Berkshire’s nearly unique and quite dependable corporate personality and large size became well known, its insurance subsidiaries got and seized many attractive opportunities, not available to others, to buy privately issued securities. Most of these securities had fixed maturities and produced outstanding results.

Berkshire’s marvelous outcome in insurance was not a natural result. Ordinarily, a casualty insurance business is a producer of mediocre results, even when very well managed. And such results are of little use. Berkshire’s better outcome was so astoundingly large that I believe that Buffett would now fail to recreate it if he returned to a small base while retaining his smarts and regaining his youth.

Did Berkshire suffer from being a diffuse conglomerate? No, its opportunities were usefully enlarged by a widened area for operation. And bad effects, common elsewhere, were prevented by Buffett’s skills.

Why did Berkshire prefer to buy companies with cash, instead of its own stock? Well, it was hard to get anything in exchange for Berkshire stock that was as valuable as what was given up.

Why did Berkshire’s acquisition of companies outside the insurance business work out so well for Berkshire shareholders when the normal result in such acquisitions is bad for shareholders of the acquirer?

Well, Berkshire, by design, had methodological advantages to supplement its better opportunities. It never had the equivalent of a “department of acquisitions” under pressure to buy. And it never relied on advice from “helpers” sure to be prejudiced in favor of transactions. And Buffett held self-delusion at bay as he underclaimed expertise while he knew better than most corporate executives what worked and what didn’t in business, aided by his long experience as a passive investor. And, finally, even when Berkshire was getting much better opportunities than most others, Buffett often displayed almost inhuman patience and seldom bought. For instance, during his first ten years in control of Berkshire, Buffett saw one business (textiles) move close to death and two new businesses come in, for a net gain of one.

What were the big mistakes made by Berkshire under Buffett? Well, while mistakes of commission were common, almost all huge errors were in not making a purchase, including not purchasing Walmart stock when that was sure to work out enormously well. The errors of omission were of much importance. Berkshire’s net worth would now be at least $50 billion higher if it had seized several opportunities it was not quite smart enough to recognize as virtually sure things.

The next to last task on my list was: Predict whether abnormally good results would continue at Berkshire if Buffett were soon to depart.

The answer is yes. Berkshire has in place in its subsidiaries much business momentum grounded in much durable competitive advantage.

Moreover, its railroad and utility subsidiaries now provide much desirable opportunity to invest large sums in new fixed assets. And many subsidiaries are now engaged in making wise “bolt-on” acquisitions.

Provided that most of the Berkshire system remains in place, the combined momentum and opportunity now present is so great that Berkshire would almost surely remain a better-than-normal company for a very long time even if

(1) Buffett left tomorrow, (2) his successors were persons of only moderate ability, and (3) Berkshire never again purchased a large business.

But, under this Buffett-soon-leaves assumption, his successors would not be “of only moderate ability.” For instance, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel are proven performers who would probably be under-described as “world-class.” “World-leading” would be the description I would choose. In some important ways, each is a better business executive than Buffett.

And I believe neither Jain nor Abel would (1) leave Berkshire, no matter what someone else offered or (2) desire much change in the Berkshire system.

Nor do I think that desirable purchases of new businesses would end with Buffett’s departure. With Berkshire now so large and the age of activism upon us, I think some desirable acquisition opportunities will come and that Berkshire’s $60 billion in cash will constructively decrease.

My final task was to consider whether Berkshire’s great results over the last 50 years have implications that may prove useful elsewhere.

The answer is plainly yes. In its early Buffett years, Berkshire had a big task ahead: turning a tiny stash into a large and useful company. And it solved that problem by avoiding bureaucracy and relying much on one thoughtful leader for a long, long time as he kept improving and brought in more people like himself.

Compare this to a typical big-corporation system with much bureaucracy at headquarters and a long succession of CEOs who come in at about age 59, pause little thereafter for quiet thought, and are soon forced out by a fixed retirement age.

I believe that versions of the Berkshire system should be tried more often elsewhere and that the worst attributes of bureaucracy should much more often be treated like the cancers they so much resemble. A good example of bureaucracy fixing was created by George Marshall when he helped win World War II by getting from Congress the right to ignore seniority in choosing generals.
