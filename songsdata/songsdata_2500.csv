I could also rant like I always do about end-of-year lists and how I especially chose to write this on the first day of the new year, because 2014 wasn’t done before all the big magazines and websites started publishing their top 10s. But maybe I could break the general rule of posts appearing on this blog and actually get to the point as soon as I start. This is going to be long, because I tried to make a top 10 and ended up with a top 15 and even more runner-ups just falling out. Yay!

Honorable mentions
These are albums that didn’t make the list, but still deserve a place in this post because they are great for some reason. The list is alphabetically by artist; there’s no ranking here.

Arsenal — Furu: A great, varied fifth album by the world music influenced producer duo, and their best so far. From the softer, guitar-driven “Sharp Teeth” to the memorable electronic “Black Mountain (Beautiful Love)”, Arsenal manage to keep you entertained.
BRNS — Patine: A great set of experimental, inventive Belgian indie rock tracks. Very good overall, especially the first half is quite strong. Not everything is at the same level, but they’ve managed to make it a very enjoyable effort.
Childcare ­ — Flush EP: A great set of punk-influenced indie rock songs, produced by To Kill A King’s Ben Jackson, but ultimately not an album, so not eligible for this list. It’s very promising though, I can’t wait for a proper debut album to come out.
Cloud Boat — Model of You: A very atmospheric but happier follow-up to last year’s debut. Well-crafted and variated.
Damon Albarn — Everyday Robots: The proper debut solo LP from the genius from Gorillaz and Blur. Very emotional and personal, but with some uplifting surprises. If you’re looking for action, you’ll be disappointed, but if you’re relaxing, this is perfect.
Ed Sheeran — ×: A more eclectic and variated album than the British singer-songwriter’s first studio album, and overall more enjoyable. Very realistic and raw lyrics from real life, but usually quite upbeat and even showing off some of his great rap skills.
Febueder — Lilac Lane EP: Brilliant experimental EP, but again too short to be an album and be on this list. It’s still brilliant though, in its style-blending gapless fashion.
Girls In Hawaii — Hello Strange: Awesome live rendition of stuff from their previous albums, everything is reworked with dedication to make the tracks sound great and they shine.
GoGo Penguin — v2.0: Mercury Prize-nominated neo-jazz album. Very original and inventive, but not extremely varied, although still very nice.
The Griswolds ­ — Be Impressive: Long-awaited debut album from the Australian indie pop band. Very catchy and earworm-filled, and everytime you’d think they’re just a one-trick pony they come up with something totally different.
Hozier — Hozier: Take Me to Church was amazing when it came out at the beginning of 2014, now radio has ruined it completely, but this album is Hozier at his best for the whole thing, not just the first track. From bluesrock to gospel, everything’s there.
Jungle — Jungle: A great debut for this British neo-soul collective, but it feels more like a collection of potential singles than a real album, except for the brilliant interlude “Smoking Pixels” then. Most of it is great though, I’d just wish for it to be more varied.
King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard — I’m In Your Mind Fuzz: Starting out with a locked-groove driven 12 and a half minute long jam spread over four tracks, this doesn’t really seem like an all that exciting album on paper, but it’s very variated and twisted and that makes it great.
Magic Man — Before the Waves: Synthrock at its best, although I think this would’ve been even better had they continued the indie rock-influenced sound of “Nova Scotia”, the only EP track not on the album, but still great overall.
Pink Floyd — The Endless River: A beautiful swansong to Richard Wright, Pink Floyd making ambient turns out extremely well and this is a high note to end their career.
Rag’n’Bone Man — Wolves EP: His incredible voice combined with the great style-blending collaborative music makes this EP a must-try.
SOHN — Tremors: Not on the list because I only really started listening to this one in January 2015 (this pick was added later on), but it definitely deserves a place in there. His amazing falsetto combined with the alternative R&B electronica is really great, the only real issue is that the overall theme is quite depressing through the whole album.
To Kill A King — Exit, Pursued by a Bear EP: This has got to be one of the best EPs I’ve ever heard, it feels more like a mini-album than an EP if you get what I mean. The placement of the tracks is perfect and this feels like a cohesive journey. Already a classic.
Tom Vek — Luck: When Tom Vek is good, he’s at his best, but sometimes his lyrics seem quite cliché and unoriginal (even though that is partially due to his extremely clear voice, but the very varied and original thoughts in “The Girl You Wouldn’t Leave for Any Other Girl” don’t really deserve an award). I think this album would’ve been better if some of the tracks were instrumental, but it’s still really good. “Broke” and “Sherman (Animals in the Jungle)” are amazing.
And now, time for the real thing!15
Kasabian — 48:13
Blending their classic swagger rock sound with electronic experimentation, this is the most innovative and memorable Kasabian record so far. Highlights include “Treat”, deluxe bonus track “Gelfling” and “Clouds”.14
Dan Croll — Sweet Disarray
The debut album from a singer-songwriter and musicology student, Sweet Disarray is full of beautiful guitar ballads, electronic experiments and innovative songwriting. You’ve heard “From Nowhere”, also check out “Can You Hear Me”, “Wanna Know”, “Sweet Disarray” and “Nobody Knows”.13
Cheatahs — Cheatahs
Shoegaze at its best. These guys have been around for quite a while now, but only released their debut this year and it’s awesome. You hear their experience. Check out “IV”, “Cut the Grass”, “Mission Creep” and “Loon Calls”.12
We Were Evergreen — Towards
Produced by Charlie Andrew, who is alt-J’s regular, Towards is a sophisticated debut album from French band We Were Evergreen. Highlights are “Cargo Cult”, “Belong”, the amazing jazzy “Eighteen” and “Daughters”.11
Thumpers — Galore
Most of this album is percussive, incredibly catchy indie pop, but although they have their signature elements, the songs are very variated, from sample-heavy (“Sound of Screams”) over epic (“Unkinder”) and emotional (“Now We Are Sixteen”) to euphoric (“Together Now”) and this is the perfect summer album, which is stupid to say at this point, but it’s soundtracked part of mine.10
Zammuto — Anchor
Formerly from the Books and supported by Gotye, Nick Zammuto’s band’s second album is not one to overlook at all. His percussion- and synth- driven experimental music is something to get used to, but once you do that, you’ll keep enjoying it. Highlights are “Great Equator”, “Hegemony”, “Don’t Be a Tool” and “Sinker”.9
Oscar and the Wolf — Entity
I remember seeing this band play at a local festival, when they had only released two EPs. I liked them, but the style was a little too dreamy for me to really love them. But I’ve been following the band, and as soon as Princes came out, I knew that they’d changed, but for the better. The electro-heavy indie pop sound of this debut is amazing and Max Colombie’s voice fits perfectly with it, which is hearable in highlights like “Strange Entity”, “Astriù”, “Undress”, “Nora” and “Killer You”. A great debut.8
Foster the People — Supermodel
Foster the People’s debut was good, but not amazing. The album didn’t sound very organic or cohesive and the dance influence was sometimes a bit too much for my liking. But Supermodel’s lead single “Coming of Age” proved everyone who thought of this band as just good at one thing completely wrong, and other tracks like “Tabloid Super Junkie”, “Pseudologia Fantastica” and “Nevermind” are as different as it can be. This is Foster the People at their highest level.7
Aphex Twin — Syro
Richard James is still the king of intelligent dance music after more than ten years of absence as Aphex Twin, his most popular alias, and that says something. Syro is his most accessible album to date, but it’s one of his best and the album takes you on a journey exclusive to James’ music. Highlights are the 2nd, 6th and last two tracks.6
Bombay Bicycle Club — So Long, See You Tomorrow
The journeys of lead singer Jack Steadman have had a clear influence on the new Bombay Bicycle album, but it’s probably their most innovative and eclectic record yet. The experimentation on banger “Carry Me” and the lighter ballad “Home By Now” shine, as well as the slow build of the closer title track. Mercury Prize-nominated, and a must-listen.5
The War on Drugs — Lost in the Dream
Somehow I only stumbled upon this after multiple sites named this the best album of 2014, but they have a reason to. It’s a gorgeously crafted album that somehow comes up with something new every few seconds, and it gets better with every single listen, with so much buried in the mix that you’ll hear something new everytime. Everything’s a highlight, this works best if listened to as a whole.4
Temples — Sun Structures
An amazing debut from this energetic British psychedelic rock band. There’s a great flow through it and the songs are all different, which makes for an exceptional listen. The guitars and synths take a place up there with the vocals, and the album is full of epic solos and instrumentals. “Sand Dance”, “Sun Structures”, “A Question Isn’t Answered”, “Move With the Season” and essential B-side “Ankh” are a must-listen.3
alt-J — This Is All Yours
An Awesome Wave won the Mercury Prize and alt-J were suddenly given quite a lot of attention, so compared to the long period in which An Awesome Wave was made, This Is All Yours was quite rushed, but it’s definitely as good. Maybe not better, but a worthy second album. If you ignore the existence of the big mistake “Left Hand Free”, this album is perfect. From the genius vocal experiment-driven “Intro” and the unexpectedly light and jazzy “Arrival In Nara” over the classic alt-J “Every Other Freckle” and inventive “Hunger of the Pine” to the beautiful “Bloodflood Pt. II”, alt-J never fail to make this enjoyable.2
Recorders — Above the Tide
To be honest, I wasn’t even looking forward to this album. I heard Beach on the radio, the track piqued my interest and I Shazamed it, only to be left with “no match” and I had to search for it myself. Luckily I found it on the channel’s website and I added Beach to my favourites, read somewhere that their album was due for the autumn, followed them on Spotify, and then completely forgot about it. When at school on the release day, I connected to the teachers’ WiFi network (muhahahahah) and got a notification that said that Above the Tide was released, so I downloaded the thing and went walking to get lunch with the record playing, and I was amazed by how good it was. Colorimetric’s bass line blew my mind completely, as did the overall feel in the album from start to finish. For a few weeks this was literally the only thing I listened to, until alt-J’s This Is All Yours came out, then it was both. The weird thing is that after overplaying the album like I do so often, I’m still not tired of it, unlike a few other albums that were great when they came out but lost their excitingness after I kept listening to them. And that is an achievement itself. Highlights include “Wolf Drums”, “Colorimetric”, “Alone In Reykjavik”, “Dive”, “85 MPH” and everything else.1
East India Youth — Total Strife Forever
When the Mercury Prize nominees were announced, this was one of the underdogs, as the press complained about how much small artists there were in the list. Damon Albarn and Bombay Bicycle Club were some of the only established artists in this and these small artists no one had heard of weren’t that exciting for everyone, looking for bigger names like Kasabian and Coldplay who were all not invited to the party. But is that necessarily a bad thing? No, it isn’t. Some of these could never have won, like GoGo Penguin’s aforementioned v2.0, which is a great album but not comparable to the others and for whom a Mercury Prize nomination is simply a boost for a talented artist, not really giving a chance to win. But out of the whole list of Mercury nominees, the description of this one caught my eye, and I’m quite thankful for that. William Doyle is extremely good at using loads of different styles but creating something using them that is exciting and different but still alike, and you’re not alienated when after the accessible pop of “Dripping Down” you’re presented with the acid techno track “Hinterland”, only to be taken away by the euphoric krautrock track “Heaven, How Long”, which then continues into the ambient “Total Strife Forever II”, you get the idea. This works best as a whole album, although “Heaven, How Long”, “Total Strife Forever I”, “Dripping Down”, “Song for a Granular Piano” and “Looking for Someone” stand out. Must-listen for this year, and no doubt my favourite album of 2014.

I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

[Verse 2]
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try
[Verse 3]
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it
Making love out of nothing at all

[Chorus]
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love)
Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all
(Making love) Out of nothing at all

[Verse 4]
Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it cause everything I know
Well it's nothing 'til I give it to you

I can make the runner stumble
I can make the final block
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone

[Verse 6]
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

I know just how to whisper
And I know just how to cry
I know just where to find the answers
And I know just how to lie
I know just how to fake it
And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream

And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you loose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you
But I know I gotta give it a try

And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall
And I don't know how you do it

Every time I see you all the rays of the sun are all
Streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes
Like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
I've gotta follow it cause everything I know

I don't remember when the music made me cry

And all the things you said to me I want to give to you

And we both wanted - A little bit of everything

We had to close our eyes and turn the lights down low
And when that song would play we stared into the light
And when I held you close we fell into the night

And every tear would be a candle in the dark

While fiddlers played so sweet and low
Their eyes hard fixed upon the other
However, would she let him go?
And when the time it came upon them
She said in case we forget

Every direction brings you back here when you go

The broken bits all made to fit

It's always hot the melting pot
A wagging tail and tongue
We never close the coffers
Make an offer until one
The world is what we've made it and its better upside down
The fastest growing biggest
Little love it-hate it town
So welcome to the chaos

And make a big donation if you want to open doors
And rest assured that your reward will help to bend some laws

And suddenly it all made sense in a weird perverted way
Thank heaven for the mumbo who came to sort it out

I woke up last night from a dream
That we'd grow old on Bleecker Street
Sit by the fire and I'd play my guitar
But dreams are only dreams

Will the moon still be white
And the river green
Sometimes I wonder if we matter at all
If we're not written down
Who will remember now?

Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bail, they can't get me out
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid here
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
S.P.'s the same, I still merk your mans-es
Drug money to rap money, work advances
Niggas ran and told, I should've merked to Kansas
Got popped for a murder attempt
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
Locked up and they won't let me out
When I hit my cellblock, niggas know the dread be out
[Verse 2: Akon]
I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin'
And now they done stopped me
And I get locked up

Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
They puttin' they hood up

I'm here at the crossroad
Where my life is heading? Man, I don't know
Should I stay or should I go?
Cause anything's better than what I've been through

What I would give to get a sign from up above?
Letting me know that everything would be okay
I wish someone would pull me off from out of the mud
Will anyone out there say to me
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here, for you
Don't worry cause I got you
Don't trip, don't stress
My life seems to be heading

[Chorus]
Over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
Feels like I'm heading over the edge
The edge, the edge

[Verse 2]
Now everyday that goes by
I see things that'll make another man cry
I'm sitting wondering why
I can't find that someone to fit in my life
See I was searching, but am I worth it?
And did they ever think I'm good enough for love?
Despite my suffering I felt the loving
The blessing came when I needed it the most

[Bridge]
And that's the sign that I received from up above
Letting me know that everything would be okay
And that was that something
That pulled me out of the mud
And also was the one that said to me

From Senegal, West Africa
To St. Louis, Missouri
Thanks to Katherine Dunham
For giving my pops his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And that's all he ever want
Mom came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
Then all of the pressure
Made 'em fight one another
See the pain would never last
Did the best with what they had
He knew the world was out for grabs
And he searched to find his

As a kid I never knew
I'd have to hustle just to make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Cause the girls don't think I'm cool
And because of that I didn't care
Whether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause that's all I ever knew
Telling me I need to slow down
Cause everybody in the whole town
Cause they know how I get down
Foreigner from another town
Can you believe we still around?
After so many hit the ground
And we ain't gone stop now
Until we get that

And they coming 'round the corner, 5 percent [?]
Chevy creepin' real slow, you know the routine
Don't try to play MacGyver
Sawed of shotgun pointin' out the window (So, Give It To 'Em)

On the side of the road, take all your word
Pocket all your dough

Talkin' Bugatti I blow it all on a vehicle
Millions in real-estate and the work that I administrate

Or else walking on it with no shoes on

Let me get up out of here

My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Pairs listening, and the band recording
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top, trying to skip my fork and
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because

You got the biggest gun, I hope it’s for protection
How you never run, you just count your blessings
Beating down the drum, find me the connection
To get up off the slum, that’s my only investment
Throw you to the ground, book you for possession
Now it’s going down, now I teach them a lesson
Crooked as a clown, wishing I could arrest him
Guess they run the town, from the streets to the correction
So

Is not this vision of loveliness your inspiration for Klingsor?” Wagner muttered something in German. “He say,” said a nearby translator, “‘How about that?’”

How about that indeed, I thought, as I made my way toward a corner of those fabled gardens, where ABC-TV’s Good Morning America and CBS’s Early Show had set up their cameras so that I could appear “live” to viewers back home in God’s country.

This was last May. In a week’s time “the Oklahoma City Bomber,” a decorated hero of the Gulf War, one of Nature’s Eagle Scouts, Timothy McVeigh, was due to be executed by lethal injection in Terre Haute, Indiana, for being, as he himself insisted, the sole maker and detonator of a bomb that blew up a federal building in which died 168 men, women, and children. This was the greatest massacre of Americans by an American since two years earlier, when the federal government decided to take out the compound of a Seventh-Day Adventist cult near Waco, Texas. The Branch Davidians, as the cultists called themselves, were a peaceful group of men, women, and children living and praying together in anticipation of the end of the world, which started to come their way on February 28, 1993. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, exercising its mandate to “regulate” firearms, refused all invitations from cult leader David Koresh to inspect his licensed firearms. The A.T.F. instead opted for fun. More than 100 A.T.F. agents, without proper warrants, attacked the church’s compound while, overhead, at least one A.T.F. helicopter fired at the roof of the main building. Six Branch Davidians were killed that day. Four A.T.F. agents were shot dead, by friendly fire, it was thought.

There was a standoff. Followed by a 51-day siege in which loud music was played 24 hours a day outside the compound. Then electricity was turned off. Food was denied the children. Meanwhile, the Media were briefed regularly on the evils of David Koresh. Apparently, he was making and selling crystal meth; he was also—what else in these sick times?—not a Man of God but a Pedophile. The new attorney general, Janet Reno, then got tough. On April 19 she ordered the F.B.I. to finish up what the A.T.F. had begun. In defiance of the Posse Comitatus Act (a basic bulwark of our fragile liberties that forbids the use of the military against civilians), tanks of the Texas National Guard and the army’s Joint Task Force Six attacked the compound with a gas deadly to children and not too healthy for adults while ramming holes in the building. Some Davidians escaped. Others were shot by F.B.I. snipers. In an investigation six years later, the F.B.I. denied ever shooting off anything much more than a pyrotechnic tear-gas cannister. Finally, during a six-hour assault, the building was set fire to and then bulldozed by Bradley armored vehicles. God saw to it that no F.B.I. man was hurt while more than 80 cult members were killed, of whom 27 were children. It was a great victory for Uncle Sam, as intended by the F.B.I., whose code name for the assault was Show Time.

It wasn’t until May 14, 1995, that Janet Reno, on 60 Minutes, confessed to second thoughts. “I saw what happened, and knowing what happened, I would not do it again.” Plainly, a learning experience for the Florida daughter of a champion lady alligator rassler.

The April 19, 1993, show at Waco proved to be the largest massacre of Americans by their own government since 1890, when a number of Native Americans were slaughtered at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Thus the ante keeps upping.
Although McVeigh was soon to indicate that he had acted in retaliation for what had happened at Waco (he had even picked the second anniversary of the slaughter, April 19, for his act of retribution), our government’s secret police, together with its allies in the Media, put, as it were, a heavy fist upon the scales. There was to be only one story: one man of incredible innate evil wanted to destroy innocent lives for no reason other than a spontaneous joy in evildoing. From the beginning, it was ordained that McVeigh was to have no coherent motive for what he had done other than a Shakespearean motiveless malignity. Iago is now back in town, with a bomb, not a handkerchief. More to the point, he and the prosecution agreed that he had no serious accomplices.

I sat on an uncomfortable chair, facing a camera. Generators hummed amid the delphiniums. Good Morning America was first. I had been told that Diane Sawyer would be questioning me from New York, but ABC has a McVeigh “expert,” one Charles Gibson, and he would do the honors. Our interview would be something like four minutes. Yes, I was to be interviewed In Depth. This means that only every other question starts with “Now, tell us, briefly … ” Dutifully, I told, briefly, how it was that McVeigh, whom I had never met, happened to invite me to be one of the five chosen witnesses to his execution.

Briefly, it all began in the November 1998 issue of Vanity Fair. I had written a piece about “the shredding of our Bill of Rights.” I cited examples of I.R.S. seizures of property without due process of law, warrantless raids and murders committed against innocent people by various drug-enforcement groups, government collusion with agribusiness’s successful attempts to drive small farmers out of business, and so on. (For those who would like further evidence of a government running amok, turn to page 397 of my The Last Empire.) Then, as a coda, I discussed the illegal but unpunished murders at Ruby Ridge, Idaho (a mother and child and dog had been killed in cold blood by the F.B.I.); then, the next year, Waco. The Media expressed little outrage in either case. Apparently, the trigger words had not been spoken. Trigger words? Remember The Manchurian Candidate? George Axelrod’s splendid 1962 film, where the brainwashed (by North Koreans) protagonist can only be set in murderous motion when the gracious garden-club lady, played by Angela Lansbury, says, “Why don’t you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?”

Since we had been told for weeks that the Branch Davidian leader, David Koresh, was not only a drug dealer but the sexual abuser of the 27 children in his compound, the maternal Ms. Reno in essence decreed: Better that they all be dead than defiled. Hence, the attack. Later, 11 members of the Branch Davidian Church were put on trial for the “conspiracy to commit murder” of the federal agents who had attacked them. The jury found all 11 innocent on that charge. But after stating that the defendants were guilty of attempted murder—the very charge of which they had just been acquitted—the judge sentenced eight innocent church members up to 40 years on lesser charges. One disgusted juror said, “The wrong people were on trial.” Show Time!

Personally, I was sufficiently outraged to describe in detail what had actually happened. Meanwhile, the card players of 1998 were busy shuffling and dealing. Since McVeigh had been revealed as evil itself, no one was interested in why he had done what he had done. But then “why” is a question the Media are trained to shy away from. Too dangerous. One might actually learn why something had happened and become thoughtful. I wrote in these pages:

For Timothy McVeigh, [Waco and Ruby Ridge] became the symbol of [federal] oppression and murder. Since he was now suffering from an exaggerated sense of justice, not a common American trait, he went to war pretty much on his own and ended up slaughtering more innocents than the Feds had at Waco. Did he know what he was doing when he blew up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City because it contained the hated [Feds]? McVeigh remained silent throughout his trial. Finally, as he was about to be sentenced, the court asked him if he would like to speak. He did. He rose and said, “I wish to use the words of Justice Brandeis dissenting in Olmstead to speak for me. He wrote, ‘Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.’” Then McVeigh was sentenced to death by the government.

Those present were deeply confused by McVeigh’s quotation. How could the Devil quote so saintly a justice? I suspect that he did it in the same spirit that Iago answered Othello when asked why he had done what he had done: “Demand me nothing, what you know you know, from this time forth I never will speak word.” Now we know, too: or as my grandfather used to say back in Oklahoma, “Every pancake has two sides.”

When McVeigh, on appeal in a Colorado prison, read what I had written he wrote me a letter and …

But I’ve left you behind in the Ravello garden of Klingsor, where, live on television, I mentioned the unmentionable word “why,” followed by the atomic trigger word “Waco.” Charles Gibson, 3,500 miles away, began to hyperventilate. “Now, wait a minute … ” he interrupted. But I talked through him. Suddenly I heard him say, “We’re having trouble with the audio.” Then he pulled the plug that linked ABC and me. The soundman beside me shook his head. “Audio was working perfectly. He just cut you off.” So, in addition to the governmental shredding of Amendments 4, 5, 6, 8, and 14, Mr. Gibson switched off the journalists’ sacred First.

Why? Like so many of his interchangeable TV colleagues, he is in place to tell the viewers that former senator John Danforth had just concluded a 14-month investigation of the F.B.I. that cleared the bureau of any wrongdoing at Waco. Danforth did admit that “it was like pulling teeth to get all this paper from the F.B.I.”

In March 1993, McVeigh drove from Arizona to Waco, Texas, in order to observe firsthand the federal siege. Along with other protesters, he was duly photographed by the F.B.I. During the siege the cultists were entertained with 24-hour ear-shattering tapes (Nancy Sinatra: “These boots are made for walkin’ / And that’s just what they’ll do, / One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you”) as well as the recorded shrieks of dying rabbits, reminiscent of the first George Bush’s undeclared war on Panama, which after several similar concerts outside the Vatican Embassy yielded up the master drug criminal (and former C.I.A. agent) Noriega, who had taken refuge there. Like the TV networks, once our government has a hit it will be repeated over and over again. Oswald? Conspiracy? Studio laughter.

TV-watchers have no doubt noted so often that they are no longer aware of how often the interchangeable TV hosts handle anyone who tries to explain why something happened. “Are you suggesting that there was a conspiracy?” A twinkle starts in a pair of bright contact lenses. No matter what the answer, there is a wriggling of the body, followed by a tiny snort and a significant glance into the camera to show that the guest has just been delivered to the studio by flying saucer. This is one way for the public never to understand what actual conspirators—whether in the F.B.I. or on the Supreme Court or toiling for Big Tobacco—are up to. It is also a sure way of keeping information from the public. The function, alas, of Corporate Media.

In fact, at one point, former senator Danforth threatened the recalcitrant F.B.I. director Louis Freeh with a search warrant. It is a pity that he did not get one. He might, in the process, have discovered a bit more about Freeh’s membership in Opus Dei (meaning “God’s work”), a secretive international Roman Catholic order dedicated to getting its membership into high political, corporate, and religious offices (and perhaps even Heaven too) in various lands to various ends. Lately, reluctant Medialight was cast on the order when it was discovered that Robert Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent, had been a Russian spy for 22 years but also that he and his director, Louis Freeh, in the words of their fellow traveler William Rusher (The Washington Times, March 15, 2001), “not only [were] both members of the same Roman Catholic Church in suburban Virginia but … also belonged to the local chapter of Opus Dei.” Mr. Rusher, once of the devil-may-care National Review, found this “piquant.” Opus Dei was founded in 1928 by Jose-Maria Escrivá. Its lay godfather, in early years, was the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. One of its latest paladins was the corrupt Peruvian president Alberto Fujimoro, still in absentia. Although Opus Dei tends to Fascism, the current Pope has beatified Escrivá, disregarding the caveat of the Spanish theologian Juan Martin Velasco: “We cannot portray as a model of Christian living someone who has served the power of the state [the Fascist Franco] and who used that power to launch his Opus, which he ran with obscure criteria—like a Mafia shrouded in white—not accepting papal magisterium when it failed to coincide with his way of thinking.”
Once, when the mysterious Mr. Freeh was asked whether or not he was a member of Opus Dei, he declined to respond, obliging an F.B.I. special agent to reply in his stead. Special Agent John E. Collingwood said, “While I cannot answer your specific questions, I note that you have been ‘informed’ incorrectly.”

It is most disturbing that in the secular United States, a nation whose Constitution is based upon the perpetual separation of church and state, an absolutist religious order not only has placed one of its members at the head of our secret (and largely unaccountable) police but also can now count on the good offices of at least two members of the Supreme Court.

From Newsweek, March 9, 2001:

[Justice Antonin] Scalia is regarded as the embodiment of the Catholic conservatives.… While he is not a member of Opus Dei, his wife Maureen has attended Opus Dei’s spiritual functions … [while their son], Father Paul Scalia, helped convert Clarence Thomas to Catholicism four years ago. Last month, Thomas gave a fiery speech at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, to an audience full of Bush Administration officials. In the speech Thomas praised Pope John Paul II for taking unpopular stands.

And to think that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams opposed the presence of the relatively benign Jesuit order in our land of laws if not of God. President Bush has said that Scalia and Thomas are the models for the sort of justices that he would like to appoint in his term of office. Lately, in atonement for his wooing during the election of the fundamentalist Protestants at Bob Jones University, Bush has been “reaching out” to the Roman Catholic far right. He is already solid with fundamentalist Protestants. In fact, his attorney general, J. D. Ashcroft, is a Pentecostal Christian who starts each day at eight with a prayer meeting attended by Justice Department employees eager to be drenched in the blood of the lamb. In 1999, Ashcroft told Bob Jones University graduates that America was founded on religious principles (news to Jefferson et al.) and “we have no king but Jesus.”

I have already noted a number of conspiracies that are beginning to register as McVeigh’s highly manipulated story moves toward that ghastly word “closure,” which, in this case, will simply mark a new beginning. The Opus Dei conspiracy is—was?—central to the Justice Department. Then the F.B.I. conspired to withhold documents from the McVeigh defense as well as from the department’s alleged master: We the People in Congress Assembled as embodied by former senator Danforth. Finally, the ongoing spontaneous Media conspiracy to demonize McVeigh, who acted alone, despite contrary evidence.

But let’s return to the F.B.I. conspiracy to cover up its crimes at Waco. Senator Danforth is an honorable man, but then, so was Chief Justice Earl Warren, and the findings of his eponymous commission on the events at Dallas did not, it is said, ever entirely convince even him. On June 1, Danforth told The Washington Post, “I bet that Timothy McVeigh, at some point in time, I don’t know when, will be executed and after the execution there will be some box found, somewhere.” You are not, Senator, just beating your gums. Also, on June 1, The New York Times ran an A.P. story in which lawyers for the Branch Davidians claim that when the F.B.I. agents fired upon the cultists they used a type of short assault rifle that was later not tested. Our friend F.B.I. spokesman John Collingwood said that a check of the bureau’s records showed that “the shorter-barreled rifle was among the weapons tested.” Danforth’s response was pretty much, Well, if you say so. He did note, again, that he had got “something less than total cooperation” from the F.B.I. As H. L. Mencken put it, “[The Department of Justice] has been engaged in sharp practices since the earliest days and remains a fecund source of oppression and corruption today. It is hard to recall an administration in which it was not the center of grave scandal.”

Freeh himself seems addicted to dull sharp practices. In 1996 he was the relentless Javert who came down so hard on an Atlanta security guard, Richard Jewell, over the Olympic Games bombing. Jewell was innocent. Even as he sent out for a new hair shirt (Opus Dei members mortify the flesh) and gave the order to build a new guillotine, the F.B.I. lab was found to have routinely bungled investigations (read Tainting Evidence, by J. F. Kelly and P. K. Wearne). Later, Freeh led the battle to prove Wen Ho Lee a Communist spy. Freeh’s deranged charges against the blameless Los Alamos scientist were thrown out of court by an enraged federal judge who felt that the F.B.I. had “embarrassed the whole nation.” Well, it’s always risky, God’s work.

Even so, the more one learns about the F.B.I., the more one realizes that it is a very dangerous place indeed. Kelly and Wearne, in their investigation of its lab work, literally a life-and-death matter for those under investigation, quote two English forensic experts on the subject of the Oklahoma City bombing. Professor Brian Caddy, after a study of the lab’s findings: “If these reports are the ones to be presented to the courts as evidence then I am appalled by their structure and information content. The structure of the reports seems designed to confuse the reader rather than help him.” Dr. John Lloyd noted, “The reports are purely conclusory in nature. It is impossible to determine from them the chain of custody, on precisely what work has been done on each item.” Plainly, the time has come to replace this vast inept and largely unaccountable secret police with a more modest and more efficient bureau to be called “the United States Bureau of Investigation.”

It is now June 11, a hot, hazy morning here in Ravello. We’ve just watched Son of Show Time in Terre Haute, Indiana. CNN duly reported that I had not been able to be a witness, as McVeigh had requested: the attorney general had given me too short a time to get from here to there. I felt somewhat better when I was told that, lying on the gurney in the execution chamber, he would not have been able to see any of us through the tinted glass windows all around him. But then members of the press who were present said that he had deliberately made “eye contact” with his witnesses and with them. He did see his witnesses, according to Cate McCauley, who was one. “You could tell he was gone after the first shot,” she said. She had worked on his legal case for a year as one of his defense investigators.

I asked about his last hours. He had been searching for a movie on television and all he could find was Fargo, for which he was in no mood. Certainly he died in character; that is, in control. The first shot, of sodium pentothal, knocks you out. But he kept his eyes open. The second shot, of pancuronium bromide, collapsed his lungs. Always the survivalist, he seemed to ration his remaining breaths. When, after four minutes, he was officially dead, his eyes were still open, staring into the ceiling camera that was recording him “live” for his Oklahoma City audience.

McVeigh made no final statement, but he had copied out, it appeared from memory, “Invictus,” a poem by W. E. Henley (1849–1903). Among Henley’s numerous writings was a popular anthology called Lyra Heroica (1892), about those who had done selfless heroic deeds. I doubt if McVeigh ever came across it, but he would, no doubt, have identified with a group of young writers, among them Kipling, who were known as “Henley’s young men,” forever standing on burning decks, each a master of his fate, captain of his soul.

Characteristically, no talking head mentioned Henley’s name, because no one knew who he was. Many thought this famous poem was McVeigh’s work. One irritable woman described Henley as “a 19th-century cripple.” I fiercely E-mailed her network: the one-legged Henley was “extremities challenged.”
The stoic serenity of McVeigh’s last days certainly qualified him as a Henley-style hero. He did not complain about his fate; took responsibility for what he was thought to have done; did not beg for mercy as our always sadistic Media require. Meanwhile, conflicting details about him accumulate—a bewildering mosaic, in fact—and he seems more and more to have stumbled into the wrong American era. Plainly, he needed a self-consuming cause to define him. The abolition of slavery or the preservation of the Union would have been more worthy of his life than anger at the excesses of our corrupt secret police. But he was stuck where he was and so he declared war on a government that he felt had declared war on its own people.

One poetic moment in what was largely an orchestrated hymn of hatred. Outside the prison, a group of anti-death-penalty people prayed together in the dawn’s early light. Suddenly, a bird appeared and settled on the left forearm of a woman, who continued her prayers. When, at last, she rose to her feet the bird remained on her arm—consolation? Ora pro nobis.

CNN gave us bits and pieces of McVeigh’s last morning. Asked why he had not at least said that he was sorry for the murder of innocents, he said that he could say it but he would not have meant it. He was a soldier in a war, not of his making. This was Henleyesque. One biographer described him as honest to a fault. McVeigh had also noted that Harry Truman had never said that he was sorry about dropping two atomic bombs on an already defeated Japan, killing around 200,000 people, mostly collateral women and children. Media howled that that was wartime. But McVeigh considered himself, rightly or wrongly, at war, too. Incidentally, the inexorable beatification of Harry Truman is now an important aspect of our evolving imperial system. It is widely believed that the bombs were dropped to save American lives. This is not true. The bombs were dropped to frighten our new enemy, Stalin. To a man, our leading World War II commanders, including Eisenhower, C. W. Nimitz, and even Curtis LeMay (played so well by George C. Scott in Dr. Strangelove), were opposed to Truman’s use of the bombs against a defeated enemy trying to surrender. A friend from live television, the late Robert Alan Aurthur, made a documentary about Truman. I asked him what he thought of him. “He just gives you all these canned answers. The only time I got a rise out of him was when I suggested that he tell us about his decision to drop the atomic bombs in the actual ruins of Hiroshima. Truman looked at me for the first time. ‘O.K.,’ he said, ‘but I won’t kiss their asses.’” Plainly another Henley hero, with far more collateral damage to his credit than McVeigh. Was it Chaplin’s M. Verdoux who said that when it comes to calibrating liability for murder it is all, finally, a matter of scale?

After my adventures in the Ravello gardens (CBS’s Bryant Gumbel was his usual low-key, courteous self and did not pull the cord), I headed for Terre Haute by way of Manhattan. I did several programs where I was cut off at the word “Waco.” Only CNN’s Greta Van Susteren got the point. “Two wrongs,” she said, sensibly, “don’t make a right.” I quite agreed with her. But then, since I am against the death penalty, I noted that three wrongs are hardly an improvement.

Then came the stay of execution. I went back to Ravello. The Media were now gazing at me. Time and again I would hear or read that I had written McVeigh first, congratulating him, presumably, on his killings. I kept explaining, patiently, how, after he had read me in Vanity Fair, it was he who wrote me, starting an off-and-on three-year correspondence. As it turned out, I could not go so I was not able to see with my own eyes the bird of dawning alight upon the woman’s arm.

The first letter to me was appreciative of what I had written. I wrote him back. To show what an eager commercialite I am—hardly school of Capote—I kept no copies of my letters to him until the last one in May.

The second letter from his Colorado prison is dated “28 Feb 99.” “Mr. Vidal, thank you for your letter. I received your book United States last week and have since finished most of Part 2—your political musings.” I should say that spelling and grammar are perfect throughout, while the handwriting is oddly even and slants to the left, as if one were looking at it in a mirror. “I think you’d be surprised at how much of that material I agree with.…

As to your letter, I fully recognize that “the general rebellion against what our gov’t has become is the most interesting (and I think important) story in our history this century.” This is why I have been mostly disappointed at previous stories attributing the OKC bombing to a simple act of “revenge” for Waco—and why I was most pleased to read your Nov. article in Vanity Fair. In the 4 years since the bombing, your work is the first to really explore the underlying motivations for such a strike against the U.S. Government—and for that, I thank you. I believe that such in-depth reflections are vital if one truly wishes to understand the events of April 1995.

Although I have many observations that I’d like to throw at you, I must keep this letter to a practical length—so I will mention just one: if federal agents are like “so many Jacobins at war” with the citizens of this country, and if federal agencies “daily wage war” against those citizens, then should not the OKC bombing be considered a “counter-attack” rather than a self-declared war? Would it not be more akin to Hiroshima than Pearl Harbor? (I’m sure the Japanese were just as shocked and surprised at Hiroshima—in fact, was that anticipated effect not part and parcel of the overall strategy of that bombing?)

Back to your letter, I had never considered your age as an impediment [here he riots in tact!] until I received that letter—and noted that it was typed on a manual typewriter? Not to worry, recent medical studies tell us that Italy’s taste for canola oil, olive oil and wine helps extend the average lifespan and helps prevent heart disease in Italians—so you picked the right place to retire to.

Again, thank you for dropping me a line—and as far as any concern over what or how to write someone “in my situation,” I think you’d find that many of us are still just “regular Joes”—regardless of public perception—so there need be no special consideration(s) given to whatever you wish to write. Until next time, then …

Under this line he has put in quotes “‘Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats.’ —H. L. Mencken. Take good care.”

He signed off with scribbled initials. Needless to say, this letter did not conform to any notion that I had had of him from reading the rabid U.S. press led, as always, by The New York Times, whose clumsy attempts at Freudian analysis (e.g., he was a broken blossom because his mother left his father in his 16th year—actually he seemed relieved). Later, there was a year or so when I did not hear from him. Two reporters from a Buffalo newspaper (he was born and raised near Buffalo) were at work interviewing him for their book, American Terrorist. I do think I wrote him that Mencken often resorted to Swiftian hyperbole and was not to be taken too literally. Could the same be said of McVeigh? There is always the interesting possibility—prepare for the grandest conspiracy of all—that he neither made nor set off the bomb outside the Murrah building: it was only later, when facing either death or life imprisonment, that he saw to it that he would be given sole credit for hoisting the black flag and slitting throats, to the rising fury of various “militias” across the land who are currently outraged that he is getting sole credit for a revolutionary act organized, some say, by many others. At the end, if this scenario is correct, he and the detested Feds were of a single mind.

As Senator Danforth foresaw, the government would execute McVeigh as soon as possible (within 10 days of Danforth’s statement to The Washington Post) in order not to have to produce so quickly that mislaid box with documents which might suggest that others were involved in the bombing. The fact that McVeigh himself was eager to commit what he called “federally assisted suicide” simply seemed a bizarre twist to a story that no matter how one tries to straighten it out never quite conforms to the Ur-plot of lone crazed killer (Oswald) killed by a second lone crazed killer (Ruby), who would die in stir with, he claimed, a tale to tell. Unlike Lee Harvey (“I’m the patsy”) Oswald, our Henley hero found irresistible the role of lone warrior against a bad state. Where, in his first correspondence with me, he admits to nothing for the obvious reason his lawyers have him on appeal, in his last letter to me, April 20, 2001—“T. McVeigh 12076-064 POB 33 Terre Haute, In. 47808 (USA)”—he writes, “Mr. Vidal, if you have read the recently published ‘American Terrorist’, then you’ve probably realized that you hit the nail on the head with your article ‘The War at Home’. Enclosed is supplemental material to add to that insight.” Among the documents he sent was an ABCNews.com chat transcript of a conversation with Timothy McVeigh’s psychiatrist. The interview with Dr. John Smith was conducted by a moderator, March 29 of this year. Dr. Smith had had only one session with McVeigh, six years earlier. Apparently McVeigh had released him from his medical oath of confidentiality so that he could talk to Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck, authors of American Terrorist.

Moderator: You say that Timothy McVeigh “was not deranged” and that he has “no major mental illness”. So why, in your view, would he commit such a terrible crime?

Dr. John Smith: Well, I don’t think he committed it because he was deranged or misinterpreting reality.… He was overly sensitive, to the point of being a little paranoid, about the actions of the government. But he committed the act mostly out of revenge because of the Waco assault, but he also wanted to make a political statement about the role of the federal government and protest the use of force against the citizens. So to answer your original question, it was a conscious choice on his part, not because he was deranged, but because he was serious.

Dr. Smith then notes McVeigh’s disappointment that the Media had shied away from any dialogue “about the misuse of power by the federal government.” Also, “his statement to me, ‘I did not expect a revolution’. Although he did go on to tell me that he had had discussions with some of the militias who lived in the hills around Kingman, AZ, about how easy it would be, with certain guns in the hills there, to cut interstate 40 in two and in that sense interfere with transportation from between the eastern and western part of the United States—a rather grandiose discussion.”

Grandiose but, I think, in character for those rebels who like to call themselves Patriots and see themselves as similar to the American colonists who separated from England. They are said to number from two to four million, of whom some 400,000 are activists in the militias. Although McVeigh never formally joined any group, for three years he drove all around the country, networking with like-minded gun-lovers and federal-government-haters; he also learned, according to American Terrorist, “that the government was planning a massive raid on gun owners and members of the Patriot community in the spring of 1995.” This was all the trigger that McVeigh needed for what he would do—shuffle the deck, as it were.

The Turner Diaries is a racist daydream by a former physics teacher writing under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. Although McVeigh has no hang-ups about blacks, Jews, and all the other enemies of the various “Aryan” white nations to be found in the Patriots’ ranks, he shares the Diaries’ obsession with guns and explosives and a final all-out war against the “System.” Much has been made, rightly, of a description in the book of how to build a bomb like the one he used at Oklahoma City. When asked if McVeigh acknowledged copying this section from the novel, Dr. Smith said, “Well, sort of. Tim wanted it made clear that, unlike The Turner Diaries, he was not a racist. He made that very clear. He did not hate homosexuals. He made that very clear.” As for the book as an influence, “he’s not going to share credit with anyone.” Asked to sum up, the good doctor said, simply, “I have always said to myself that if there had not been a Waco, there would not have been an Oklahoma City.”

McVeigh also sent me a 1998 piece he had written for Media Bypass. He calls it “Essay on Hypocrisy.”

The administration has said that Iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons … mainly because they have used them in the past. Well, if that’s the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims that this was done for the deterrent purposes during its “Cold War” with the Soviet Union. Why, then, is it invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence)—with respect to Iraq’s (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?…

Yet when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes “a shield.” Think about it. (Actually, there is a difference here. The administration has admitted to knowledge of the presence of children in or near Iraqi government buildings, yet they still proceed with their plans to bomb—saying that they cannot be held responsible if children die. There is no such proof, however, that knowledge of the presence of children existed in relation to the Oklahoma City bombing.)

Thus, he denies any foreknowledge of the presence of children in the Murrah building, unlike the F.B.I., which knew that there were children in the Davidian compound, and managed to kill 27 of them.

McVeigh quotes again from Justice Brandeis: “Our government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or ill it teaches the whole people by its example.” He stops there. But Brandeis goes on to write in his dissent, “Crime is contagious. If the government becomes the law breaker, it breeds contempt for laws; it invites every man to become a law unto himself.” Thus the straight-arrow model soldier unleashed his terrible swift sword and the innocent died. But then a lawless government, Brandeis writes, “invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means—to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would bring terrible retribution.”

One wonders if the Opus Dei plurality of the present Supreme Court’s five-to-four majority has ever pondered these words so different from, let us say, one of its essential thinkers, Machiavelli, who insisted that, above all, the Prince must be feared.

Finally, McVeigh sent me three pages of longhand notes dated April 4, 2001, a few weeks before he was first scheduled to die. It is addressed to “C.J.”(?), whose initials he has struck out.

I explain herein why I bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. I explain this not for publicity, nor seeking to win an argument of right or wrong, I explain so that the record is clear as to my thinking and motivations in bombing a government installation.

I chose to bomb a Federal Building because such an action served more purposes than other options. Foremost, the bombing was a retaliatory strike: a counter-attack, for the cumulative raids (and subsequent violence and damage) that federal agents had participated in over the preceding years (including, but not limited to, Waco). From the formation of such units as the FBI’s “Hostage Rescue” and other assault teams amongst federal agencies during the 80s, culminating in the Waco incident, federal actions grew increasingly militaristic and violent, to the point where at Waco, our government—like the Chinese—was deploying tanks against its own citizens.

… For all intents and purposes, federal agents had become “soldiers” (using military training, tactics, techniques, equipment, language, dress, organization and mindset) and they were escalating their behavior. Therefore, this bombing was also meant as a pre-emptive (or pro-active) strike against those forces and their command and control centers within the federal building. When an aggressor force continually launches attacks from a particular base of operations, it is sound military strategy to take the fight to the enemy. Additionally, borrowing a page from U.S. foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government. Bombing the Murrah Federal Building was morally and strategically equivalent to the U.S. hitting a government building in Serbia, Iraq, or other nations. Based on observations of the policies of my own government, I viewed this action as an acceptable option. From this perspective what occurred in Oklahoma City was no different than what Americans rain on the heads of others all the time, and, subsequently, my mindset was and is one of clinical detachment. (The bombing of the Murrah Building was not personal no more than when Air Force, Army, Navy or Marine personnel bomb or launch cruise missiles against (foreign) government installations and their personnel.)

I hope this clarification amply addresses your question.

Sincerely, T.M., USP Terre Haute (In.)

There were many outraged press notes and letters when I said that McVeigh suffered from “an exaggerated sense of justice.” I did not really need the adjective except that I knew that few Americans seriously believe that anyone is capable of doing anything except out of personal self-interest, while anyone who deliberately risks—and gives—his life to alert his fellow citizens to an onerous government is truly crazy. But the good Dr. Smith put that one in perspective: McVeigh is not deranged. He is serious.

It is June 16. It seems like five years rather than five days since the execution. The day before the execution, June 10, The New York Times discussed “The Future of American Terrorism.” Apparently, terrorism has a real future; hence we must beware Nazi skinheads in the boondocks. The Times is, occasionally, right for the usual wrong reasons. For instance, their current wisdom is to dispel the illusion that “McVeigh is merely a pawn in an expansive conspiracy led by a group of John Does that may even have had government involvement. But only a small fringe will cling to this theory for long.” Thank God: one had feared that rumors of a greater conspiracy would linger on and Old Glory herself would turn to fringe before our eyes. The Times, more in anger than in sorrow, feels that McVeigh blew martyrdom by first pleading not guilty and then by not using his trial to “make a political statement about Ruby Ridge and Waco.” McVeigh agreed with the Times, and blamed his first lawyer, Stephen Jones, in unholy tandem with the judge, for selling him out. During his appeal, his new attorneys claimed that the serious sale took place when Jones, eager for publicity, met with the Times’s Pam Belluck. McVeigh’s guilt was quietly conceded, thus explaining why the defense was so feeble. (Jones claims he did nothing improper.)

Actually, in the immediate wake of the bombing, the Times concedes, the militia movement skyrocketed from 220 anti-government groups in 1995 to more than 850 by the end of ’96. A factor in this growth was the belief circulating among militia groups “that government agents had planted the bomb as a way to justify anti-terrorism legislation. No less than a retired Air Force general has promoted the theory that in addition to Mr. McVeigh’s truck bomb, there were bombs inside the building.” Although the Times likes analogies to Nazi Germany, they are curiously reluctant to draw one between, let’s say, the firing of the Reichstag in 1933 (Göring later took credit for this creative crime), which then allowed Hitler to invoke an Enabling Act that provided him with all sorts of dictatorial powers “for protection of the people and the state” and so on to Auschwitz.

The canny Portland Free Press editor, Ace Hayes, noted that the one absolutely necessary dog in every terrorism case has yet to bark. The point to any terrorist act is that credit must be claimed so that fear will spread throughout the land. But no one took credit until McVeigh did, after the trial, in which he was condemned to death as a result of circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution. Ace Hayes wrote, “If the bombing was not terrorism then what was it? It was pseudo terrorism, perpetrated by compartmentalized covert operators for the purposes of state police power.” Apropos Hayes’s conclusion, Adam Parfrey wrote in Cult Rapture, “[The bombing] is not different from the bogus Viet Cong units that were sent out to rape and murder Vietnamese to discredit the National Liberation Front. It is not different from the bogus ‘finds’ of Commie weapons in El Salvador. It is not different from the bogus Symbionese Liberation Army created by the CIA/FBI to discredit the real revolutionaries.” Evidence of a conspiracy? Edye Smith was interviewed by Gary Tuchman, May 23, 1995, on CNN. She duly noted that the A.T.F. bureau, about 17 people on the ninth floor, suffered no casualities. Indeed they seemed not to have come to work that day. Jim Keith gives details in OKBOMB!, while Smith observed on TV, “Did the A.T.F. have a warning sign? I mean, did they think it might be a bad day to go into the office? They had an option not to go to work that day, and my kids didn’t get that option.” She lost two children in the bombing. A.T.F. has a number of explanations. The latest: five employees were in the offices, unhurt.

Another lead not followed up: McVeigh’s sister read a letter he wrote her to the grand jury stating that he had become a member of a “Special Forces Group involved in criminal activity.”

In the end, McVeigh, already condemned to death, decided to take full credit for the bombing. Was he being a good professional soldier, covering up for others? Or did he, perhaps, now see himself in a historic role with his own private Harper’s Ferry, and though his ashes molder in the grave, his spirit is marching on? We may know—one day.

As for “the purposes of state police power,” after the bombing, Clinton signed into law orders allowing the police to commit all sorts of crimes against the Constitution in the interest of combating terrorism. On April 20, 1996 (Hitler’s birthday of golden memory, at least for the producers of The Producers), President Clinton signed the Anti-Terrorism Act (“for the protection of the people and the state”—the emphasis, of course, is on the second noun), while, a month earlier, the mysterious Louis Freeh had informed Congress of his plans for expanded wiretapping by his secret police. Clinton described his Anti-Terrorism Act in familiar language (March 1, 1993, USA Today): “We can’t be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans.” A year later (April 19, 1994, on MTV): “A lot of people say there’s too much personal freedom. When personal freedom’s being abused, you have to move to limit it.” On that plangent note he graduated cum laude from the Newt Gingrich Academy.

In essence, Clinton’s Anti-Terrorism Act would set up a national police force, over the long-dead bodies of the founders. Details are supplied by H.R. 97, a chimera born of Clinton, Reno, and the mysterious Mr. Freeh. A 2,500-man Rapid Deployment Strike Force would be organized, under the attorney general, with dictatorial powers. The chief of police of Windsor, Missouri, Joe Hendricks, spoke out against this supra-Constitutional police force. Under this legislation, Hendricks said, “an agent of the F.B.I. could walk into my office and commandeer this police department. If you don’t believe that, read the crime bill that Clinton signed into law in 1995. There is talk of the Feds taking over the Washington, D.C., police department. To me this sets a dangerous precedent.” But after a half-century of the Russians are coming, followed by terrorists from proliferating rogue states as well as the ongoing horrors of drug-related crime, there is little respite for a people so routinely—so fiercely—disinformed. Yet there is a native suspicion that seems to be a part of the individual American psyche—as demonstrated in polls, anyway. According to a Scripps Howard News Service poll, 40 percent of Americans think it quite likely that the F.B.I. set the fires at Waco. Fifty-one percent believe federal officials killed Jack Kennedy (Oh, Oliver what hast thou wrought!). Eighty percent believe that the military is withholding evidence that Iraq used nerve gas or something as deadly in the Gulf. Unfortunately, the other side of this coin is troubling. After Oklahoma City, 58 percent of Americans, according to the L.A. Times, were willing to surrender some of their liberties to stop terrorism—including, one wonders, the sacred right to be misinformed by government?

Shortly after McVeigh’s conviction, Director Freeh soothed the Senate Judiciary Committee: “Most of the militia organizations around the country are not, in our view, threatening or dangerous.” But earlier, before the Senate Appropriations Committee, he had “confessed” that his bureau was troubled by “various individuals, as well as organizations, some having an ideology which suspects government of world-order conspiracies—individuals who have organized themselves against the United States.” In sum, this bureaucrat who does God’s Work regards as a threat those “individuals who espouse ideologies inconsistent with principles of Federal Government.” Oddly, for a former judge, Freeh seems not to recognize how chilling this last phrase is.

The C.I.A.’s former director William Colby is also made nervous by the disaffected. In a chat with Nebraska state senator John DeCamp (shortly before the Oklahoma City bombing), he mused, “I watched as the Anti-War movement rendered it impossible for this country to conduct or win the Viet Nam War.… This Militia and Patriot movement … is far more significant and far more dangerous for Americans than the Anti-War movement ever was, if it is not intelligently dealt with.… It is not because these people are armed that America need be concerned.” Colby continues, “They are dangerous because there are so many of them. It is one thing to have a few nuts or dissidents. They can be dealt with, justly or otherwise [my emphasis] so that they do not pose a danger to the system. It is quite another situation when you have a true movement—millions of citizens believing something, particularly when the movement is made up of society’s average, successful citizens.” Presumably one “otherwise” way of handling such a movement is—when it elects a president by a half-million votes—to call in a like-minded Supreme Court majority to stop a state’s recounts, create arbitrary deadlines, and invent delays until our ancient electoral system, by default, must give the presidency to the “system’s” candidate as opposed to the one the people voted for.

Many an “expert” and many an expert believe that McVeigh neither built nor detonated the bomb that blew up a large part of the Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. To start backward—rather the way the F.B.I. conducted this case—if McVeigh was not guilty, why did he confess to the murderous deed? I am convinced from his correspondence and what one has learned about him in an ever lengthening row of books that, once found guilty due to what he felt was the slovenly defense of his principal lawyer, Stephen Jones, so unlike the brilliant defense of his “co-conspirator” Terry Nichols’s lawyer Michael Tigar, McVeigh believed that the only alternative to death by injection was a half-century or more of life in a box. There is another aspect of our prison system (considered one of the most barbaric in the First World) which was alluded to by the British writer John Sutherland in The Guardian. He quoted California’s attorney general, Bill Lockyer, on the subject of the C.E.O. of an electric utility, currently battening on California’s failing energy supply. “‘I would love to personally escort this CEO to an 8 by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says—“Hi, my name is Spike, Honey.”’ … The senior law official in the state was confirming (what we all suspected) that rape is penal policy. Go to prison and serving as a Hell’s Angel sex slave is judged part of your sentence.” A couple of decades fending off Spike is not a Henley hero’s idea of a good time. Better dead than Spiked. Hence, “I bombed the Murrah building.”

Evidence, however, is overwhelming that there was a plot involving militia types and government infiltrators—who knows?—as prime movers to create panic in order to get Clinton to sign that infamous Anti-Terrorism Act. But if, as it now appears, there were many interested parties involved, a sort of unified-field theory is never apt to be found, but should there be one, Joel Dyer may be its Einstein. (Einstein, of course, never got his field quite together, either.) In 1998, I discussed Dyer’s Harvest of Rage in these pages. Dyer was editor of the Boulder Weekly. He writes on the crisis of rural America due to the decline of the family farm, which also coincided with the formation of various militias and religious cults, some dangerous, some merely sad. In Harvest of Rage, Dyer made the case that McVeigh and Terry Nichols could not have acted alone in the Oklahoma City bombing. Now he has, after long investigation, written an epilogue to the trials of the two co-conspirators. Herewith, some of his startling findings.

In the end, on June 2, 1997, Timothy McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts, including conspiracy and eight murder charges pertaining to what the F.B.I. called the “OKBOMB.”

The prosecution did a good job of skirting some of its case’s weaker points, such as the fact that some explosive experts questioned whether a single fertilizer bomb could account for the extensive damage done to the Murrah building, and that no fewer than 10 witnesses claimed to have seen a Ryder truck parked at Geary Lake in Kansas—the location where, the goverment argued, the bomb was assembled—prior to the time McVeigh actually rented the truck used in the bombing. The most damaging testimony against McVeigh came from a former army buddy and his wife, Michael and Lori Fortier. The Fortiers turned State’s evidence, Michael testifying that McVeigh had planned to destroy the Murrah building because he believed that the orders to raid the Branch Davidian compound had originated there. Michael also told the jury that he had helped McVeigh case the Murrah building before the bombing. Despite the evidence to the contrary, the Fortiers claimed that they had not been involved in the bombing plot. Michael was sentenced to 12 years.

Stephen Jones continually pointed out that the Fortiers were liars and methamphetamine users, and so not reliable. But the jury was unmoved. The presentation of McVeigh’s defense was scarcely a week long. Jones often left the jury more confused and bored than convinced of his client’s innocence. Even when he succeeded in his attempts to demonstrate that a large conspiracy was behind the bombing, he did little to show that McVeigh was not at the center of the conspiracy. Jones’s case led some reporters to speculate that McVeigh himself was limiting his own defense in order to prevent evidence that might implicate others in the bombing from entering the record.

Both Playboy and The Dallas Morning News published what they purported to be confessions by McVeigh to his defense team. In both articles, McVeigh admitted to the bombing. In many circles, the confessions have been viewed as proof that only McVeigh and Nichols were directly involved in the bombing. After all, that’s what McVeigh was reported to have claimed. But there is reason for skepticism. I believe that by confessing McVeigh was, once again, playing the soldier, attempting to protect his co-conspirators.

Did the government blow it? Terry Nichols was tried in the fall of 1997. From the beginning, the government’s case against Nichols was more difficult to prove than that against McVeigh. Biggest difference: Nichols was in Kansas at the time of the bombing. Also, Nichols had a good lawyer in Michael Tigar. The jury found Nichols innocent of murder but guilty of planning to bomb the Murrah building and guilty of eight counts of involuntary manslaughter. Next, the jury deadlocked during sentencing, which ruled out the death penalty. After two days of deliberation, the forewoman, Niki Deutchman, informed Judge Richard P. Matsch that the jury was hung. On June 4, 1998, Matsch stepped in and sentenced Terry Nichols to life, but the judge’s decision was not without controversy. Deutchman told the press, “Decisions were probably made very early on that McVeigh and Nichols were who they were looking for, and the same sort of resources were not used to try to find out who else might be involved.… The government really dropped the ball.” Some of the jurors thought that there may have been others involved who are still at large. Shortly after her news conference, Deutchman reportedly received bomb threats.

And then the government responded.

Attorney General Janet Reno blasted Deutchman’s criticism. Reno assured the nation that the F.B.I. had followed every lead in its effort to find those responsible for the blast. She denied a larger conspiracy and said that McVeigh and Nichols were the sole perpetrators of the crime.

Unfortunately, Janet Reno is likely wrong. During my investigation, which included an examination of all the McVeigh discovery materials, I unearthed evidence that the F.B.I. did not follow up on solid leads, or, if they did, failed to turn those over to the defense. I uncovered information provided to the F.B.I. by Kansas law enforcement, and by very reliable eyewitnesses who were apparently disregarded. More important, I found evidence that the F.B.I. may have withheld certain information from the defense teams during discovery, potentially tainting the verdicts against both McVeigh and Nichols.

Subject No. 1. The first time Charles Farley was shown a picture of the man he repeatedly tried to get the F.B.I. to investigate was December 10, 1997. Farley was seated on the witness stand in a federal courtroom in Denver, and the man showing him the photo did not work for the government. He worked for Terry Nichols. “Mr. Farley, … do you recognize the individual depicted in this picture?” asked Adam Thurschwell, one of Nichols’s defense attorneys. “Yes, sir,” answered Farley. “That was the individual that was standing at the door of the truck, the individual that gave me a dirty look,” he said.

Farley was testifying for the defense about his experience a few days before the bombing. Farley, an employee of the Fort Riley Outdoor Recreation Center, near Geary Lake, had already told the F.B.I. that on April 17 or 18, 1995, he had gone to the lake to scout out the fishing potential. After inspecting the lake, Farley drove down the road that led back to the highway, but his departure was slowed by a number of vehicles parked close to the exit—a pickup, a large stakebed truck, a brown car, and a Ryder truck—and standing near the vehicles were several men. The large truck was burdened with what he believed were bags of ammonium nitrate fertilizer. “It looked like it was completely weighted down,” Farley told the jury. He thought the truck was stuck due to the weight of the fertilizer, and decided to offer assistance. He quickly changed his mind when one of the men—the same man, he believed, he was identifying more than two and a half years later in court—shot him a nasty glare. The man was standing practically next to Farley’s car, and he had a number of distinguishing features, including a beard with no mustache. A few days later, after the bombing, Farley claims, he saw the man again. This time on TV, being interviewed about militia issues. By then it was known that the bomb had been detonated in the back of a Ryder truck that had allegedly been rented in Junction City, Kansas, close to Geary Lake. The bomb was said to have been made from ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Thinking that he may have had eyewitness information about the men who built the bomb, Farley called an F.B.I. tip line. Two weeks later an agent appeared at his workplace for an interview, but apparently that visit was as far as the government went in following this important lead, despite the fact that Farley’s information seemed to confirm the government’s suspicions regarding the location where the bomb was constructed. The F.B.I. apparently did not try to identify the individual Farley had seen up close. According to sources close to the defense, Nichols’s attorneys, believing they had learned the identity of the man Farley had seen, asked the F.B.I. during the trial for all of its information on the individual. They were given a file containing nothing more than newspaper clippings. There was nothing in the file to indicate that the F.B.I. had ever attempted to contact the man or to place him in a lineup for Farley to identify. They hadn’t even bothered to contact the Topeka television station to review the footage of Farley’s suspect.

I found this lack of investigation curious. In mid-1997, I decided to attempt to identify the mystery man, based solely on Farley’s description. Within 20 minutes of placing the first phone call to my militia contacts in Kansas, I was able to identify the man in the photo Farley had been shown in the courtroom. Subject No. 1 was hardly low-profile within the anti-government movement.

In addition to appearing on television, the man was quoted in a Kansas City newspaper article after the bombing, bragging that he was using Freemen tactics to pass off bogus liens and checks in Kansas. Several Kansas law-enforcement sources told me that, at the time these quotes were published, there was a massive federal investigation into Freemen-sponsored bank fraud in Kansas—an investigation that included Farley’s man. I have confirmed the existence of this investigation through several sources. Since Subject No. 1 was under investigation, there should have been more in his file than newspaper clippings. Information, it appears, was withheld from the defense team. Why didn’t the F.B.I. pursue Farley’s lead? The best explanation is that it posed a serious problem to the government’s cases against McVeigh and Nichols. You see, Farley saw five people, not two, with ammonium nitrate and a Ryder truck.

Subject No. 2. The day after the bombing, two police sketches were faxed to media organizations and law-enforcement offices across the country. They depicted two men who were believed to have detonated the bomb, John Doe No. 1 and John Doe No. 2. McVeigh, taken into custody 90 minutes after the bombing for driving without a license plate and carrying a concealed weapon, was quickly identified as John Doe No 1. John Doe No. 2 has never been identified by the F.B.I.

Shawnee County, Kansas, sheriff’s deputy Jake Mauck says he nearly fell out of his chair when, shortly after the bombing, he compared the John Doe No. 2 sketch to the photo of a known anti-government activist in his area. Shawnee County is about 50 miles east of Junction City, where the Ryder truck was rented and where McVeigh stayed overnight at the Dreamland Motel with another man, who has never been identified. Mauck says he quickly alerted the F.B.I. about his suspicions concerning Subject No. 2. For reasons that will likely never be known, the F.B.I. apparently failed to respond to Mauck’s information. Nor did it heed similar tips from Suzanne James, an employee of the Shawnee County D.A.’s office. The F.B.I. told her that agents had already investigated Mauck’s John Doe look-alike. So had they? Apparently not. One person who did investigate the man Mauck and James suspected is Mike Tharp, a reporter for U.S. News & World Report. Mauck talked to Tharp after his frustration with the Feds became unbearable. Tharp obtained a photo of Subject No. 2 and started showing it to people known to have seen a man other than Terry Nichols with McVeigh in the days leading up to the bombing. When he showed the photo to Barbara Whittenberg, the owner of the Santa Fe Trail Diner in Herington, who claims she saw John Doe No. 2 with McVeigh, she said, “I’d almost swear that was the guy.” Others to whom Tharp showed the photo believed it was the man they had seen with McVeigh. When Tharp inquired to the F.B.I. about the individual, he was given the line that is becoming all too familiar: “We’ll follow any lead.” There is no evidence the F.B.I. has even bothered to follow a lead regarding Subject No. 2.

Subject No. 3. Within days of the bombing, Russell Roe, an assistant county attorney for Geary County, Kansas, sat down with F.B.I. agents and told them about a man in his area known to be involved in anti-government activities. Roe said that the individual resembled John Doe No. 2, and also that this man was said to have been exploding fertilizer bombs on his eastern-Kansas farm prior to the Murrah-building explosion. Suzanne James, the woman in the Shawnee County D.A.’s office, told the Feds about the same individual. James says that the government was uninterested in her information. After placing approximately five phone calls to the F.B.I., she gave up. Pottawatomie County sheriff Tony Metcalf gave Subject No. 3’s name to the F.B.I. Further, in the fall of 1997, I interviewed Cliff Hall, the owner of The Topeka Metro News. He told me that Subject No. 3 had taken out public notices in his publication. The ads were Freemen-style concoctions dealing with renouncement of citizenship and lien notices. Hall says a Secret Service agent came to his paper to obtain copies of the notices as part of their investigation into Subject No. 3.

Subject No. 3 was also named in a document pertaining to a federal bank-fraud investigation in Texas. The Texas case resulted in federal fraud charges’ being filed against several anti-government Republic of Texas (R.O.T.) members, including the group’s leader, Richard McLaren. As part of its evidence against R.O.T., the government entered videotapes of the group preparing the fraudulent bank warrants. The videos also revealed a surprise. They clearly showed that the person teaching the R.O.T. how to create the bogus documents was none other than Subject No. 3. What McLaren’s defense team couldn’t understand was why their client and virtually every other person on the tape was arrested and charged, whereas Subject No. 3 was never charged in this investigation. The defense team began to suspect a sting operation. According to court documents in the McLaren case, Tom Mills, McLaren’s attorney, asked the government for all of its files pertaining to Subject No. 3. The prosecutors, in a move explained only to the judge, filed a motion to keep Subject No. 3’s files from the McLaren defense team. The government would turn over the files only if they would be held “in camera.” In other words, the F.B.I. would make them available to the judge but not to the defense.

Undaunted by the “in camera” setback, McLaren’s defense team tried a new approach. If they couldn’t see the files, they would subpoena the man. Mills hired an investigator, who quickly located Subject No. 3 in Oregon. Mills asked the court for money to fly the investigator to Oregon to serve the subpoena. The judge agreed, but then the government did something even more unusual than suppressing files. It arrested Subject No. 3 in the middle of the night, just five hours before the subpoena would have been served. Mills spent several hours interviewing Subject No. 3 in a Dallas jail. Afterward, Mills filed yet another motion, which stated that he was more convinced than ever that the man had cooperated with authorities on some level in the past, and therefore the attorney should be allowed to view the “in camera” files. His request was again denied. Subject No. 3 eventually took the stand while the jury was sequestered. The conventional wisdom said that if he was a government agent or informer he would have to take the Fifth. But he didn’t. When asked by the judge if he was the man named in the subpoena, the subject gave a standard Freemen defense. He asked the judge to spell his name and confirm which letters were capitalized. The judge did so and the man said that the judge had spelled his name incorrectly. At that point, the government prosecutors, who had worked so hard to keep Subject No. 3 from testifying, told the judge that the man was in need of psychiatric evaluation. The judge agreed, and Subject No. 3 was never forced to explain his apparent immunity to prosecution. In April 1998, McLaren was found guilty on 27 federal counts. His defense team was never allowed access to Subject No. 3’s files.

Despite the F.B.I.’s continuing denial, what we do know is that the government inexplicably failed to investigate solid leads pertaining to Subjects No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and, I suspect, still others in their organization.

It will be interesting to see if the F.B.I. is sufficiently intrigued by what Joel Dyer has written to pursue the leads that he has so generously given them.

Thus far, David Hoffman’s The Oklahoma City Bombing and the Politics of Terror is the most thorough of a dozen or two accounts of what did and did not happen on that day in April. Hoffman begins his investigation with retired air-force brigadier general Benton K. Partin’s May 17, 1995, letter delivered to each member of the Senate and House of Representatives: “When I first saw the pictures of the truck-bomb’s asymmetrical damage to the Federal Building, my immediate reaction was that the pattern of damage would have been technically impossible without supplementing demolition charges at some of the reinforcing concrete column bases.… For a simplistic blast truck-bomb, of the size and composition reported, to be able to reach out in the order of 60 feet and collapse a reinforced column base the size of column A-7 is beyond credulity.” In separate agreement was Samuel Cohen, father of the neutron bomb and formerly of the Manhattan Project, who wrote an Oklahoma state legislator, “It would have been absolutely impossible and against the laws of nature for a truck full of fertilizer and fuel oil … no matter how much was used … to bring the building down.” One would think that McVeigh’s defense lawyer, restlessly looking for a Middle East connection, could certainly have called these acknowledged experts to testify, but a search of Jones’s account of the case, Others Unknown, reveals neither name.

In the March 20, 1996, issue of Strategic Investment newsletter, it was reported that Pentagon analysts tended to agree with General Partin. “A classified report prepared by two independent Pentagon experts has concluded that the destruction of the Federal building in Oklahoma City last April was caused by five separate bombs.… Sources close to the study say Timothy McVeigh did play a role in the bombing but ‘peripherally,’ as a ‘useful idiot.’” Finally, inevitably—this is wartime, after all—“the multiple bombings have a Middle Eastern ‘signature,’ pointing to either Iraqi or Syrian involvement.”

As it turned out, Partin’s and Cohen’s pro bono efforts to examine the ruins were in vain. Sixteen days after the bombing, the search for victims stopped. In another letter to Congress, Partin stated that the building should not be destroyed until an independent forensic team was brought in to investigate the damage. “It is also easy to cover up crucial evidence as was apparently done in Waco.… Why rush to destroy the evidence?” Trigger words: the Feds demolished the ruins six days later. They offered the same excuse that they had used at Waco, “health hazards.” Partin: “It’s a classic cover-up.”

Partin suspected a Communist plot. Well, nobody’s perfect.

“So what’s the take-away?” was the question often asked by TV producers in the so-called golden age of live television plays. This meant: what is the audience supposed to think when the play is over? The McVeigh story presents us with several take-aways. If McVeigh is simply a “useful idiot,” a tool of what might be a very large conspiracy, involving various homegrown militias working, some think, with Middle Eastern helpers, then the F.B.I.’s refusal to follow up so many promising leads goes quite beyond its ordinary incompetence and smacks of treason. If McVeigh was the unlikely sole mover and begetter of the bombing, then his “inhumane” (the Unabomber’s adjective) destruction of so many lives will have served no purpose at all unless we take it seriously as what it is, a wake-up call to a federal government deeply hated, it would seem, by millions. (Remember that the popular Ronald Reagan always ran against the federal government, though often for the wrong reasons.) Final far-fetched take-away: McVeigh did not make nor deliver nor detonate the bomb but, once arrested on another charge, seized all “glory” for himself and so gave up his life. That’s not a story for W. E. Henley so much as for one of his young men, Rudyard Kipling, author of The Man Who Would Be King.

Finally, the fact that the McVeigh-Nichols scenario makes no sense at all suggests that yet again, we are confronted with a “perfect” crime—thus far.Embed",502000.0,[]

[Verse 1: Papoose
The soldiers get trained by the lieutenant
The lieutenant get all his orders from the Captain
General, when I was young I got drafted
Sent to the army of Brooklyn, those bastards
Fallen soldiers my homies lay in caskets
They couldn't survive the Heat just like the Mavericks
And I don't buy Wolf tickets from niggas
But niggers be wolfin so I walk around with my Clippers
Some of my people was alive for my struggle
But didn't live to see my success
They wanted to see me make it but got stripped naked
And laid in the morgue cause of death
So yo now that I'm successful how could I celebrate it
They died early so in their eyes I never made it
I ain't gonna give you my life you gotta take it
Soldier, I'm goin out blazin

Put my hat on the bed when I walked in the room
Swept my feet and I didn't even spit on the broom
What I'm tryin to say is I'm not superstitious
Akon what am I? (I'm a Ghetto soldier)
My right hand itchin' been had money kid
I even opened the umbrella in the crib
Bought my girl some shoes she didn't walk out of my life
No bad luck I skipped the Po twice
No superstition just wise intuition
On the battlefield, get killed to do the killin
By the way my good luck charm is a biscuit

No pain no gain all the trauma is killin me
Pain can't swim that's why I drown in the Hennessy
Tied to the enemy run in your crib slump you in your fireplace
And have smoke comin out of your chimney
I can see straight through your plot and your trickery
It don't mean shit to me
I'm tryin to get to the bottom of it
But I lost a whole lot of my energy
Tryin to get to the bottom of a bottomless industry
Nowadays all I got is my pride and my dignity
You ridin with sympathy they say misery needs company
Why keep them company you kiddin me?
When I can grab a weapon and put him out of his misery
Send shots at you to tell you I'm not playing
When you fire back you let me know what you saying
This gun bustin it's like an unspoken language
We communicate with our gun this shit is dangerous

Some real niggas that make up my entourage

I got a castle on the hill the game is all panache
A big suite in the front for my ma ma ma
And big screens so I can see some Sha Na Na
A indoor pool to dive in I keep it warm
Your game’s a turn off B see mine I keep it on
You play in this game and sleep it will so you wrong
You got to gorilla this thing I’m a show you all
That hiatus I was on I was stacking chips
I let the weak fall off came back when I was fit
In shape now Mayweather of this rap thing
Ain’t no mistaking my moves see I’m the rap King

Throwing up and passing out in back of cop cars
Somewhere between dirtball & avant garde
You heard the rumors Slug showed up and bought the bar
Read about me in the magazines
The tabloids want to know what happening
Doing anything to get my hands on that cream
Then burn it up like my limousine gasoline
Fuck love tell me what I need a wifey for
I go on tour cause the groupies all like me more
I’m like a whore girl now bite the floor
Won’t even tell you bout the story from the night before
Watch me study me see me fly
I don’t care man I swear I’m a reach the sky
Everybody hates life but I feel alright
Stay bent cause my management keeps me high
Got enough charisma to pass the test
She gonna smile while I autograph the breast
Paparazzi better step back and show respect
Or I’m a sock the damn camera man in his neck
Look mama I’ve reached my goals

Cars and links and rings and clothes
With my fame and my fortune who needs to sew

Four letter fast talk, dripping out my chatter box
No bank account in my name I got a stash box
20 grand underneath the mattress and a black Glock
I’m the have nots mascot everyday plan and plot
Trying to get my hands on what the haves got
Ah
I ain’t  rich but I’m bad and enjoy the shit out the lil’ bit that I have
I know I got it all never kissing no ass
And punching time clocks is just a thing of the past
Blame Rhymesayers for creating a monster
True official Rock Star amongst you impostors
Turned down the sponsors turned up my collar
If I make a jam about you best believe you’ll win an Oscar
Charles D Dutton you nuts
Cause I do it out of nothing but my love and respect
But if I love the way I catch a publishing check
Can’t blame a star for shining what the fuck you expect
You know I’m globally known but the more that I roam
The more that they support at home
Got a life size poster in the store that we own
Lit up on Hennepin so I can always be shown
Couple rap legends like to blow up my phone
I ain’t sold out nothing but the shows that I’ve thrown
Permanent soul glowing I'm holding my own
I’m in The Source and The Rolling Stone
Now let me tell you bout me

The door squeaks
There's a fieldmouse a-nibblin' on a broom
And I set by myself
Like a cobweb on a shelf
By myself in a lonely room

But when there's a moon in my winder
And it slants down a beam 'cross my bed
Then the shadder of a tree starts a-dancin' on the wall
And a dream starts a-dancin' in my head
And all the things that I wish fer
Turn out like I want them to be
And I'm better than that smart-aleck cowhand
Who thinks he is better'n me

And the girl I want
Ain't afraid of my arms
And her own soft arms keep me warm
And her long, yeller hair
Falls across my face
Jist like the rain in a storm

The floor creaks
The door squeaks
And the mouse starts a-nibblin' on the broom
And the sun flicks my eyes—
It was all a pack o' lies
I'm awake in a lonely room

I ain't gonna dream about her arms no more
I ain't gonna leave her alone

The first day in the studio is when the finished track started to come together.\n\nThe next day the guy who was giving us studio time for free said ‘Come on in at eight in the morning.’ We got there at eight in the morning and Al still didn’t have verses for the song yet. So that same guy told us to go grab some breakfast and to come back in an hour. Within that hour is when Al wrote the lyrics for the song. He wrote them on a napkin when we were sitting and eating at McDonalds. Once we returned back to the studio, he put down the verses and that completed the song.']])]"

All our friends are breaking up
Cause they don't never talk things through
All they ever do is making love
Being without you just ain't cool
You're my baby and I'm feeling you
There's no place I'd rather be
Than wrapped up in your arms tonight
Just you and me

[Chorus]
Only you could love me the way you do
Only you would put up with the things I do (yes you would, know you would)
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (ah, ha, ha, ha)
Only you can love me the way do (yes you do, I know you do, I know you want it, ooh)
Girl I like it when you're in the mood
So I play like I'm a drink and you're the food
I turn the phone off so no one disturbs our groove (don't you dare disturb our groov-oo-oo-oove)
Call in sick so we can spend the day
If you don't mind I want the needle in the hay

And if I get it lady I will stay around

[Chorus]
(Cause baby I love you) (Only you can love me the way you do)
(Woo, sometimes I'm so out of control)
Making love to you changes my gray skies to blue (ah, ha, ha, ha)

Only you (you) could love me the way do (take it to the bridge now)
Girl there will be no more lonely nights (girl there will be no more lonely nights)
We'll make love instead of always fighting
So (don't you dare disturb our groove)
Girl you're the only, girl you're the only lips (the only lips I want to kiss)
And I will grant your every wish tonight

If blood will flow, when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the color of the evening sun
Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away
Something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence
And nothing never could
For all those born beneath that angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are, woo
[Chorus]
On and on the rain will fall
Like tears from a star, woo, like tears from a star
On and on the rain will see
How fragile we are (Fragile we are), how fragile we are

Why? Why you?

[Verse 1]
Saw children playing on the swings today
It took me back to an innocent place
Always wanted the children running round me
Life interrupted, crying eyes, I can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to share my days
At least until the sun went down
Or at least until we both turned gray
Girl, I never had a clue that you'd be taken away
No one to conquer life with
[Chorus]
You ain't here no more, I still can't believe it's true
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
No other woman can replace the feelings I feel for you
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
It makes me wanna take a break and walk away from life
Girl, I will never stop loving you (Loving you)
Dreams of marriage put a hole in my heart, I'm missing you
Girl, you're gone too soon

[Verse 2]
It's been so hard not to think about us
Just holding hands and all the plans was like a deep cut
That'll never heal with time, it's sad to say
I lost my friend, not looking forward to those lonely days

[Pre-Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to share my days
At least until the sun went down
Or at least until we both turned gray
Girl, I never had a clue that you'd be taken away
No one to conquer life with, woo

Nobody taught us so we end up in the corporate office
All about the scratching out the DJ in the park with
All the breakers the waves spinning could make us nauseous
The glorious flow euphoria the more that they book it the warrior
Dream big like Notorious footage
Criminal minded I live and put my niggas on it
Here's the reason why they hate me more than the Monday morning
All you new niggas boring how the fuck is you touring
I'm tired of hearing about your watch and how your bitch is foreign
Rakim benz chain puff drop the newest cut
This shit is easy as making all of these groupies blush
Boy in the hood success chooses a few of us
Style furious like they nigga that's lining Cuba up
Ya'll don't do enough
These niggas acting
Until I send them a long clip this ain't no movie stuff
Spice 1 tapes and Pac was the toughest
Doggystyle show and tell teacher was disgusted
By the album cover nostalgia I fell in love with
My career morning sex simply I'm up and coming
Wait
I'm a late bloomer
If ex-nerds wasn't these record execs
My presence would have been felt sooner
Lady killer I laid with a cougar
She got my dick hard as a stare from Medusa
Im Cool J and true but
Cautious your baby mama gets swooped up
Hit her from behind like the Heimlich maneuver
Wu Tang wizard rings duck and Axel Foley
Think I got rigor mortis my diamonds poke out the Rollie
Cars premature seat color Rita Ora
I go Ham could probably make Brother Malcolm eat the pork
Wifey fuck me like a sleazy whore
Mama can't wait til her youngest is at the awards
But niggas snitching the witness that was the viewers choice
I pray to god they don't nominate me and my boys
Sick of all this wack rap shit I get annoyed
I pray you wake up a different man like Caster Troy
I'm Kool G Rap in Gucci
Brad Jordan, Early Eazy in Ralph Lauren peep my performance
Lauryn was ill Ms. Hill shit
I used to hang up pictures of Nas
The legends ain't die they simply live inside of my mind
We live in a time when A&Rs want to be stars
Bought a chain with your advance but did you go far
With ya one hit
Wonder if you gonna make it til next year with dumb shit
Rhyming like a found pun shit
Playing Hov and Cass had me in the best shape
Can't forget Das Effex on my cassette tapes
I'm blessed, was conversing with Heavy before he passed
He told me write every rhyme like it's my last
Pass the Gray Poupon
Bad chick Mulan
Tell her bend it over let me fold it like a futon
Flow stay tight
The sound track to my life
So right now get your money fuck them hoes is my new song
Fuck them then I move on
Green like croutons I'm hood
But I made it to corporate throw the suit on
I got the world tight but fuck 'em
Throw the lube on
Louboutin red bottoms head shot 'em
DMV
Bad bitches from DMV
Tell my niggas fucking with me
Gonna keep 'em in the lead
We are the elite
Don't wonder don't ask questions
Hoppin out the Phantom
Looking like black perfection
My mama can't wait til I cover the front of Essence
I'm black Johnny Depp in the flesh
Question
They are dripping with worship
Cause I smell like Obsession
You know the flow ugly
Like a bad reflection wait
You can't see me boy you too cock eyed
Your bout as real as a 2Pac sighting
Nigga please
I'm two shots shy of a ring
The Shia Lebeouf of the game
Better tuck in your chain
Deebo coming
I'm talking so rich I don't need no money
I need that Deniro Casino money
Fuck outta here
Listening to my tape
She lick it and she gyrate
I'm fucking her to Luther
I'm stickin it to shawty
I'm sticking to the script
The movie's called My Way
I like a Halle Berry
But I prefer her my age
Niggas don't ball they just flop
Vlade Divac, Hicock
Ladies rapping sideways
As a young nigga i was listening to Pete Rock
Somebody tell the doc i'm still waiting to be detoxed
Please tell Hov I got the same flow he got
Never was a pussy
But I be in the g-spot
Man this shit is easy
Damn I'm going hard
Man these niggas tripping like Stanley on the lawn
Baby I'm the truth
Right hand to God
Porsche with the big eyes like Diana Ross
Man them boy sweet like the shit in granny jars
Niggas stay in your lane if you can't stand the charge
I got heart like a nigga met the plug and ran off
You better bust a move or we gonna have a dance off
Annie are you OK
Turn you to a cold case
Bet your baby daddy be number one in the whole race
All I do is doe chase
All I do is Dolce
I been hot since '08
Scratch that
I been hot since momma say go play
Bossin'
Man these niggas awkward
Commander of the starship
I go dumb at will
Call me Karyn Parsons
All I need is new paper like it came with crawfish
If you want the green I'm the freshest on the market
Even white bitches love me like a discount at Target
I'm flawless
First fight I had couldn't run to my dad
Still I always be myself can't succumb to the fad
Supersonic with the flow
Kemp off the glass
Even my past bright like they running my tag

I find my way through the five o'clock rush hour
As daylight slowly leaves the sky
I open the door to that little room
That we call home

And ooh yeah, now
Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there to meet me
At the end of the day
You know it's always been that way
Ooh yeah, now

And then I find my way through the early morning traffic
But someone else is heavy, heavy on my mind
I open the door to our favorite little coffee shop
Ooh, y'all, the girl is right on time now, come on

Her loving arms are there to greet me
Her tender lips are there, always there to meet me
And that's how I start my day
It's just too bad it doesn't end that way

That phrase, however, is derived from a poem that begins:\n\nOh! ‘tis love, 'tis love, 'tis love,\nThat makes the world go round.\n\nThe phrase’s origin is difficult to trace, but one of the oldest sources can be found in Volume 3 of The Universal Songster, or the Museum of Mirth as the beginning of the poem “Oh! ‘Tis Love!” by an unnamed author. A clue is provided by Volume 26 of Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, published in 1829. In it, the author of “Dibdin’s Sea Songs; or, Scenes in the Gun-Room” translates and quotes a French sonneteer saying the lines above.\n\nThe phrase then grew in prominence across many cultural works, including Lewis Carroll’s 1865 novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and later took the simpler, modern form of “Love makes the world go round” through songs written by Perry Como, Bob Merrill (for the musical Carnival!), Deon Jackson, Madonna, Ashlee Simpson and beyond.\n\nThe cruel irony is that the powerful force that “makes the world go round” causes pain and suffering for one whose heart was broken.""]])]"

In the Bible’s Gospel of John it states this,“ Jesus said to the people who believed in him, “You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings. 32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”\n(John 8:31-32 NLT)\n\nAl Green came from a religious upbringing in Arkansas, but moved out of the family home over a dispute with his parents over secular music.\n\n (From http://www.biography.com/)\n\nReverend Al Green\n\nWhile on the road in 1973, Al Green was born again as a Christian. Despite his revived faith, Green continued touring and releasing music much as he had previously, though he did leave audience members taken aback by occasionally pausing to sermonize during performances. But Green’s life changed on October 18, 1974, when Mary Woodson, a woman who had walked away from her family to be with Green, attacked him in his bathroom with a pan of boiling hot grits. Woodson then shot and killed herself in Green’s Memphis home.\n\nDuring the long recovery from his third-degree burns, Green devoted himself to his faith. When Green had healed, he bought a church, the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Memphis, and began leading services there. In addition to becoming a pastor, Green turned back toward spiritual music.']])]"

I'm not causin' no trouble for you baby
This story just can't be true, baby (Just can't be true, baby)
How can I convince you, baby
But just tell you the truth

I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, waitin' for you
(Lemme tell you what I'm doin')
I'm layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you

I'm livin' for you, givin' for you, givin' for you

Layin' for you, prayin' for you, workin' for you

Long lay the world in sin
And error pining
'Til He appeared
And the soul felt
It's worth a thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new
And glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine

He will bless the right
And condemn the wrong
Come my sisters and brothers
And sing this song

I've got a message for you
Gotta have a positive attitude
Nothing my God can not do

The time is now
To reach all the people
Now what I'll do

Jesus is mine
Look beyond my faults
Just one more time
Please Lord, forgive me
Try me one more time
Your truth and devotion

No more tears
Say goodbye to sorrow

Said He would spring forth a well

But now I'm found
God shed His grace on me

I pour out my heart
Now I'm walking out the door
I don't want to cry no more

And misty memories of days gone by

La, yeah9Embed",84260.0,"[('What makes the world go ’round?', [[""The answer here is assumed to be love, derived from the idiom “Love makes the world go ‘round”. That phrase, however, is derived from a poem that begins:\n\nOh! ‘tis love, 'tis love, 'tis love,\nThat makes the world go round.\n\nThe phrase’s origin is difficult to trace, but one of the oldest sources can be found in Volume 3 of The Universal Songster, or the Museum of Mirth as the beginning of the poem “Oh! ‘Tis Love!” by an unnamed author. A clue is provided by Volume 26 of Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine, published in 1829. In it, the author of “Dibdin’s Sea Songs; or, Scenes in the Gun-Room” translates and quotes a French sonneteer saying the lines above.\n\nThe phrase then grew in prominence across many cultural works, including Lewis Carroll’s 1865 novel Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and later took the simpler, modern form of “Love makes the world go round” through songs written by Perry Como, Bob Merrill (for the musical Carnival!), Deon Jackson, Madonna, Ashlee Simpson and beyond.\n\nThe cruel irony is that the powerful force that “makes the world go round” causes pain and suffering for one whose heart was broken.""]])]"

And the crowd was standing near

When I'll no longer have to look less ""intimidating""
When we'll no longer be assaulted and humiliated
The day is coming when our kids won't be afraid, When they'll no longer have to run from pain
And the system protects them from the hurt and the blame
And our young kings and queens can freely reign

[Verse 1: Shunaji]
I'm harsh but gentle
Most days I've been sentimental
Those lyrics in Welcome, I meant 'em
I pray like amen, don't fuck with your man
And I've done things I won't be doing again
Instead, I scribble in pen, rap is my only friend and testimony
Yeah, hile eating lobster with Tony, he adore me, a fan of
We never speak unless we speak Italiano, the mulianos
Se rappo, non vado piano
Volo, un aeroplano, different language (hey)
An alien alienated, come from another planet
I am isolated, Princess Solo stay on my own island
Other rappers wouldn't manage
I found a way through the ice age
And I survived it, I'm the animal adaptable to different climates
I got your tune on iTunes under Various Artists
Don't mind me, that other cypher was manic
Shit you couldn't imagine, I grabbed the mic
And they panicked, jaws droppin' like acid
They tripped on these adlibs, I made a beat and I rapped it
And I will be your favourite rapper
[Chorus: Amahla]
Oh, the rhythm's on my mind
If only I could be defined
With all this time you're wasting here
I'm living life spontaneously

[Verse 2: Shunaji]
I've been reinventing my dreams 'cause demons come in my sleep
There's things you wouldn't believe and you can't see them either
I come in tune through speakers with keys like aphrodisiacs
Don't give a fuck about Stevia, I need my coffee sweeter
I call them how I see them, now my thoughts are buried deep and
I keep losing my breath, vocabularies carry words that go unsaid
I'm blessed but don't forget it
I forged my future so I'll never regret it
Living spontaneously, I've been the little black sheep
So rich with individuality, divided yet united
I am the particles of an atom, can't copy this because it's been copyrighted
Hand me your writing, sitting frantically, typing
Speaking frankly I'm tired, but being tired's inspiring
I'm in the hands of the choir, I sing:
If you don't dig, you're a liar, I set the bar always higher
I'll put these bars up for hire, a poltergeist kind of writer

Too many words could twist my tongue like high schoolers
I'm undercover like Mulan, the elephant in the room and
A Moulin Rouge kind of foolish

Call me Cupid, I could shoot you with arrows
I am the psychic that's been reading your tarots
What do I see? Your mentality's narrow
Narrowed down, kinda shallow
I work on Cinco de Mayo, I'm out here fighting El Paso
It's casual and if I go there's flowers on my altar
My alter ego is un'altra
They worship me like La Blanca
To be alone is a mantra, not at the mall with a tantrum
Runnin' and pantin', I run from humanity like the phantom
I am Sick Ranchez, I'm the rando with hype
And a lay0low kinda type, just work the day then the night
And if I may be then I might provide delight with these rhymes

And even the palms seem to be swaying

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

In her back yard

Bellerin' like a prune-fed calf
With a big gang hanging round
And to that crowd
She hollered loud:

With nothing but a fine-tooth comb?

In an automobile
A great big diamond, coach and footman
Hear that lady squeal
He's all alone

Stop a minute, listen to me
Won't I see you no more?

When I track I flip back like an acrobat
Now due to the bounce and the bass
I got it like that
Dropping shit like Al Bundy
For the money, honey
Now, who's the dummy
Rolls of fresh hundreds in my gunny
Sack, mack, sharp as a tack
So watch where you're steppin
Or your feets'll go flat
So spare me with the drama mama
Trip to the Bahamas
You will not be taken me
Cause ya sugar daddy's awaken
I don't eat pork
So I ain't bringing ya home no bacon
I don't flizz? at you and you in a grunion no what am making
Now that I know, that you know, that I know, what you know
Go with the flow or be heading out the door
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Catch the sucka by the toe
Then if he hollas let him go
Hell no
A lot of rappers do a snitch in the 90's
I'm leaving them bound and gagged
And with ya women you'll find me
[Chorus]
Don't stop me
Not now
Cause I'm a cool brown brother
And I'll show you how
Don't stop me
Not now
Cause I'm a cool brown brother
And I'll show you how

[Verse 2]
Back like the river
This is really in the middle
Coming smooth like a violin
Never play you like a fiddle
6 foot, weight 1-8-5 to be exact
Gold tee, gold shoe
Having like brown black guy
But I don't sing
Swing to the funk rhythm beat
And a bring
Ding ding ding
Ring the alarm
Money in my pocket is my good luck charm
A benny out a pennies from Cali to Hongkong
Up from the Bronx to the roads of Mexico
And of to Jamaica where the big buds grow
And smoke on and on, like a fat blunt
Also catch the rhythm like a pack wild dogs on a fox hunt
I seek and destroy as if I had some Tasmanian in me
And heat the party up like a tree
So tim-ber
When you hear the clamber of the drum
Come from the booming system
And any MC stepping up will discover you'll get smoothered
Word to mother
Cause I'm a bad brown brother

Knock a wild tiger out his cage
Spitting out lyrics like bucks from a gage

So peep a level head

And when Salome danced and had the boys entranced
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality

I used to be a pimpsta, known for my gangsta mentality
Hooked up with Big Chief and Ninety-Three’s, smoke up a scheme with some guns he knew from Sicily
A shipment of coke was comin’ in to Tennessee
So I left shop and headed south for the winter
Memphis was my destination
Paper chasin’ was my imo, creepin’ thru Black haven inna limo
Laced up in Mеcca on my wrist small lilvado
Call back to shop west haven lookin' for Station
Junkie answеred the phone told me station was gone
Dig that but my cousin Al wanted to speak
Told me Vinnie from around the block wanted to infiltrate my street hold heat if that shit jumps off
I'm be there inna month so forget about it
Niggas know that even when I'm wrong, I'm right
And the godness within me help me sleep at night
I'm only Twenty years old and I got the nutz to run shit
A mobster east lobster chillin' with my syndicate
I was connected, a wise guy and now I'm father
Gettin' words in this game, but yet I must go farther
I'm shakin' a lil' bit, but the thought of it has got me thinkin'
That if I don't get out right now I'll probably die to sqeekin'

When I got there, he showed me love, kissin' my cheeks
Say he like how G-R operatin' the streets
Say he want me to smoke up some guns, collect the funds, and brought an early death so don't talk to no one
Daily pointly I get it, he told me to get the fuck out

Made the car and now we ready to bounce
Hit the guns and Ima new a boat to enter the south
Went through customs in Florida, and we got caught
I pay off lawyers so my whole family dodged they case, Gambino, I see no reason, not to kill that nigga who said fuckit and took shots at my brother

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainYou might also likeEmbed",783527.0,[]

And her daddy has told her to go

To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen

Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads

To my mother, my dog, and clowns

The bold and certain hand
That turned the dragons trembled
He touched the Holy Lamp
And faintly saw his feet

And just beside the door
His pure uncertain tears
The burden fell so tender
And in the darkest night a
Rose grew by his feet
Stand beside me now
I've been in your place
And you've been in mine
And the only difference
Is our space and time
And the only light is
Somehow in the lamp
That's at your feet
Why can't you see?

But ain't it high
Ain't holy when you see?
And it's just times when
I'm weary worries me

Lamp guards the night

It’s typical Al Jarreau. David Foster and I basically wrote the track, the melody and all the chord changes, and David released it on an instrumental album that he did in Japan. I took the song to Al and I said, ‘Man, this is perfect for you, we gotta record this.’ Al Jarreau is a terrible lyricist. He’s awful. When it’s time for the big payoff everything turns into candy. It’s like in ‘Breakin’ Away': ‘Show me some climbing boots, show me some parachutes,’ what are you talking about, man?”""]]), ('Intro', [[""Graydon is an accomplished guitarist who played the solo on Steely Dan’s “Peg.” Here, he used a single-note muted guitar technique. Says Graydon: “If I was hired to play rhythm, and I didn’t play chords, it would be a single note thing. The best example is ‘Mornin’.‘ That’s also a harmonized part. And it’s actually four parts. Well, it’s two parts, but they’re doubled. Meaning I play the top part, and then I played it again on another track, put it in stereo, and then played the lower part, and then played it again on another track, and split it in stereo. On the JaR album, there’s a song called 'Make Somebody’ that will give the example of how the muted guitar part thing works.”""]])]"

Where's the tender hearts that loved romance
They seem so few

So, I write these words to say
Take heart have faith in love's tomorrow
Where our precious dreams will all come true
Heaven knows what I've been through
Searching for a heart that's true

Everyone must journey till that questioning is through

Shine a star for me to see
What children see on Christmas morning
Every hope and dream
To be renewed

Heaven only knows how I
Hope that chance of love is higher than
One in a million

But my dreams are only of the best that we can do

So, I'll keep on counting sheep
And will not sleep until the dawning

Sometimes life seems full of complications
Hard to see the forest for the trees
Just a little brave imagination
Opens up new possibilities
So look behind your eyes
You'll be surprised at what you see

Life is full of tricky situations
Don't get caught up in the yesterdays
There's a something called imagination
Even little children find a way
So put your hand in mine
I bet we'll open up the door
If we seek we'll find
Shining star's design
Get out the lamp and bring
Our fantasies to light
We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away
Imagine you and me
A dance in ecstasy
Believe and it shall be
It's the chance that we should take

There's a man I know
South of the border
Who's seen the world
And never left his home
I heard him talkin'
To his only daughter
He said you don't have to fear
The great unknown
Darling in your mind
You've got the best
And that ain't all
If you seek you'll find
Shinning star's design
We got the lamp that brings
Our fantasies to light

We've got take a spark
And try to light the dark
And take this dream to heart
We can't let it get away
We take what's on or minds
And give it room to shine
And see what we can find
There's so much to celebrate
Imagine you and me
A dance in ecstasy
Believe and it shall be

I do something that will please you baby
And I know having you around
Well, just keeps me grounded

If I get jealous, if I act like a fool
It's an overreaction to loving you

That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all
All other men try for you
They won't give you what I do now, baby
I won't share, want you to myself
So I'll keep trying

Gonna make my lovin' the best it can be
'Cause I need your devotion desperately

All or nothing at all
That's what I need from you
And baby it's true
I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all

Just tell me now that there's no other man
'Cause I don't want my heart broken up again
And when you say that you'll never let go
Only then will I know, woah

I'll be there whenever you call
But I need all or nothing at all
Lay your love on the line
Right now, I need you to
Lay your love on the line,baby

There's no greater crime than wastin' your life on a boat goin' nowhere
When you came along ... you made it safe for love to survive
I trusted and dreamed and you came like I knew you would
I've been 'round before but this feels so good

I could not walk by ..... I knew that I'd found ...
What's at the end of the rainbow
There's no place on earth I'd rather be than stayin' right here with you
It's not about luck ..... I don't need to knock on wood ... no, no ...
Been 'round before but this feels so good
Chorus:
Night after night it's so hard to believe ...
That I wake up each day next to you
Time after time in the cold mornin' light, it's good to know ...
It's good to know ... that it's true

There's no greater sin than missin' your chance ...
When it's starin' right at'ya
That look in your eye says everything and tells me I'm home
For once in my life I don't feel misunderstood

Watching one window pain fight back the rain

Once upon a time
You And I had an everlasting love that ended way before it's time
Scattered like the stars in the sky
Are the feelings that I have for you that never got to shine
And it cuts me to the core
But I keep coming back for more
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain
Saying every line I should have said
Knowing every little move that I should have made instead
Tortured by a mind that won't forget
And my heart is like a butterfly trapped inside your net
And it's breaking me into
But for you it is the least I'd do
As long as love remains, then it's pleasure over pain

Hear the seconds ticking by
Praying that you'll change your mind
Breaking every rule I know
Ready to give up my pride
Waiting for a second chance
Have I waited way too long
If I had you here again
You would never leave I know
Here I am again tonight

There's no deceivin, there's no disguise
What you need is a what you want
You hide behind what you put up front

So we find ourselves together
I'm the only one to blame
What I thought would last forever
Just another part of your game

I must have been a fool
I must have broke some rule
Now I'm losing you to the wind
So I'm all alone with my yesterday, once again
I'm back to the bottom line
Sometimes love can make or break you
Can build you up or shake you down
If it's real you don't need to fake it
If it's not no need to hang around
If you're with me for a reason
The time has come to let me know
'coz it seems your heart is freezin'
But you still don't wanna let me go

And you say (so you say) no more rainy days
Go your way (go your way) and you send me mine

Stepping outside she is free

Standing
Alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""daddy, our baby is gone""
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How
Could she do this to me?
She ( we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
( never a thought of ourselves)
Home
( we struggled all our lives to get by; bye bye)
Something inside that was
Always denied for so many years
She's
Leaving home; bye , bye

Upset me this time of the mornin'! ]

Hmmm! I guess you got my letter
Hmmm! Well every word I said was true
But just in case your postman breaks a leg
I thought I'd get another message off to you

Hmmm! I settled down in Paris
Hmmm! I get to love them weekends too
I'd like to pitch a tent by your back fence
And yell and scream all night this message overdue:
""I'd just like to hold you, enfold you and make it right
But it's nice to know you are in good hands tonight""

Oops! Hmm! I never had good timing
Hmmm! I'm late again, that's why you're through
But please ignore the time, enjoy the ride, girl
And let the meaning and the message sing to you:

""I'd just like to hold you, enfold you and make it right
But it's nice to know you are in good hands tonight, yes""

Do I seem alright? S'pose I'll be alright
'Specially when the sky is so blue
But if she's sad of eyes with deep blue sighs
Let me sing this song again just like it's new

Oooh! Well baby, here's my final letter
Hmmm! But perhaps that's really not quite true
Woa! 'Cause if your friend was right and you really called last night
To ask the question could my message mean 'I do'

Brighter days

When every song we sang is sung again
And now we know
We know this time it's for good
And we're lovers once again
And you're near me
I can remember the rain in december
The leaves of brown on the ground
In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

I can recall my desire
Every reverie is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time they play that spain again

I can remember the rain in december
The leaves of brown on the ground
Our love was a spanish fiesta
The bright lights and sounds were our joy each day
And the nights were the heat of yearning

I can recall my desire every reverie
Is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
And we live again as if dreaming

It’s typical Al Jarreau. David Foster and I basically wrote the track, the melody and all the chord changes, and David released it on an instrumental album that he did in Japan. I took the song to Al and I said, ‘Man, this is perfect for you, we gotta record this.’ Al Jarreau is a terrible lyricist. He’s awful. When it’s time for the big payoff everything turns into candy. It’s like in ‘Breakin’ Away': ‘Show me some climbing boots, show me some parachutes,’ what are you talking about, man?”""]]), ('Intro', [[""Graydon is an accomplished guitarist who played the solo on Steely Dan’s “Peg.” Here, he used a single-note muted guitar technique. Says Graydon: “If I was hired to play rhythm, and I didn’t play chords, it would be a single note thing. The best example is ‘Mornin’.‘ That’s also a harmonized part. And it’s actually four parts. Well, it’s two parts, but they’re doubled. Meaning I play the top part, and then I played it again on another track, put it in stereo, and then played the lower part, and then played it again on another track, and split it in stereo. On the JaR album, there’s a song called 'Make Somebody’ that will give the example of how the muted guitar part thing works.”""]])]"

Clapped in church on Sunday morning
Grandma's hands
Played a tambourine so well
Grandma's hands
Used to issue out a warning
She'd say: Billy don't you run so fast
Might fall on a piece of glass
Might be snakes there in that grass
Grandma's hands
Grandma's hands
Soothed a local unwed mother
Grandma's hands
Used to ache sometimes and swell
Grandma's hands
Used to lift her face and tell her
Baby, Grandma understands
That you really love that man
Put yourself in Jesus' hands
Grandma's hands

Grandma's hands
Used to hand me piece of candy
Grandma's hands
Picked me up each time I fell
Grandma's hands
Boy, they really came in handy
She'd say"" Matty don' you whip that boy

Your face, the rain in Paris, a distant bell
Now, inside my head, I still recall the moment
There was something that you said

And now, only now, if somehow I were younger
Nimble little fingers remember each melody
Melodies and days that I adored
Flower vases, cathedral doors

So long to sailin', safe by my door
Sunny place inside, comforting is all paid for
Too late for some change of mind, ohh, how would I ever find me?
Through rain and crying you were saying
Every heart is safe inside a place
That makes and shapes the changing
Make the change, sail away beyond the wishing star
Dreamers gettin' armor

Froze in the altitudes, toasting the latitudes
Old empty platitudes, tossing, turning, freezing and burning
Comin' around, comin' around, settlin' down
Comin' around, settlin' down

Ice cream and thunder, night beasts and butterflies
Most mornin's I'd settle for a little rain
I'll let it in and let it out, I'll blow it over, coda
Start all over again, makin' the bitter end a friend

Play that restless melody for me again
The one I've been, been so afraid of my sweet friend
Maybe the little refrain will whisper inside the rain again
Play the one with all the changes

Some lullabies for sleeping, a lullaby for weeping
And one to teach my heart to fight and win
Singing a sailin' song
Sun song, sun song

Now inside my head I still recall the moment
There was something that you said
I live inside the moment

Look in their eyes and you'll know that it's true

2nd verse
And all the lonely people
The first ones and the last ones
All the great and small ones
The ones that win and lose

All of the remembered
Even the forgotten
From every single nation
You know it's true...for me and you

Don't you turn away, something I say
Could keep her faithful and true

Used to say, satin, silk and lace
Fascinate a pretty face
Bet you're life she'll stay
I was stunned, struck dumb y'all
Total strangers when she walked away, she told me

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real we make a melody down in my soul
Callin' all players, Don Juan, Romeo too
Please dont' turn away, everything I say
Is with affection for you

She's in pain, cause' when you hit and run
Like you're blind, deaf, and dumb, every dreams' undone
Only one way to hold her
Be for real before she walks away

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real I get a tickle down in my soul

It's how you say it, it's all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me
If it's for real I get a tickle in the middle

Round and round, they all fall down
It's just a losing game when you break it down
(Let me just break it down)

[Repeat: x2]
It's how you say it, all in how you play it
If it's a love I get to feeling it baby
It's how you move me, it's all in how you do me

Puddit it in your shoe
Puddit it in your locket
In your kidney stew

Corner of your office
Floor boards of your car
BB King sure keeps 'em
In that blues guitar

No matter where you go
Whatever game you playin'
Never leave home without some
Put some in everyday
To keep it in your laughter
Twinkle in your eye
Up in all your rafters
Underneath your tie

Puddit in your chapel
Underneath the pew
All your kids in chapter
Skipin' back to school

No matter where you go
Whatever game you playin'
Don't you leave home without some
Puddit in everyday

When the people start to roar
We, come back for more

Puddit it in your locket

Really, really touch somebody
With a random act of love

VERSE: 1
Everything we do with good intent
Won't ever disappear, it only ripples into habit
Ever deep, cause it's no accident
That you and I are here
And you and I were meant to happen
CHORUS
There's one thing, that i know
That's like a gift unto the giver
And that's a random act of love
Everyday find a cause
And let it flow just like a river
Into a random act of love

VERSE: 2
An open heart can change the world we know
Into a loving place
Reviving everything that's givin' in it
Every spark, another chance to grow
Let love illuminate
The place where light is dimming

CHORUS
There's one thing, that i know
That's like a gift unto the giver
And that's a random act of love
Everyday find a cause
And let it flow just like a river
Into a random act of love

VERSE 3
One simple thing
Can really touch somebody
Make somebody smile inside
What joy it brings
To really touch somebody
Love's a win-win heart reliever
As good for the giver as it is the receiver
Really touch somebody with a random act of love
Really touch somebody with a random act of love

But there's more to the book, somehow
Yellin' on the corner just a waste of time

Cause you know there's much more to the script
Try to lift your spirits to the very tip

Life is
Worth much more to me
Than you could maybe never ever see
See Life is
Worth much more to me
Than you could ever…
The other day I was afraid of being hypnotized
By so many people whose dreams won't begin to be realized
But I came to know
The lessons they were told wasn't really so
But they kept tellin' me
Do all the things we do and you'll be good to go
See..

CHORUS X 1

You ain't really drivin' as long as you ridin'
With those who would steal your soul
You've been crippled to pieces so dig what they preach
And don't come with that hit no more
I'm down for the cause I mean takin' a pause
Really live for the time we're given
Baby, can't you hear the drum?

Thunder rumblin' in a minor key
It made me remember my Mama, my Mama's smile
She said mind what you thinkin' and
There are places you should
And places you should not be

Workin' on fifth round down at Shelley's
Now if you shoot six the seventh one's free
I can't be the last one to leave here again tonight
I was lookin' at number seven when you
Walked in and brought a light
CHORUS:
I was in the wrong place at the right time
The devil had an arm around me
But your sweet heart found me & I must 'a been prayin' right
I was in the wrong place at the right time, child
You took a three time loser and you turned him around
Lost and found

I don't mean to overglorify you
Or make you somethin' that you cannot be
But if you could do me just one favor would you child
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in
And rescued me

CHORUS x 1
A heart recovered
What a sight to see
Would you believe what your love has done for me?
You were good to me
Tell me what were you doin' in heaven before you dropped in and rescued me?

Past the rainbow
Beyond the moon and the stars
We found Love

Now it's ours my Lady
A gift to cherish
Sent down from heaven above
And I'm-I'm so thankful, baby
That I've got you
And I'm so glad- I don't know why
I deserve you baby
I won't question it
I'll just have faith, oh
CHORUS:
I believe
That we'll never really figure out the mystery
That's behind all of the joy we're feelin'
I can see, that some things are beyond understanding
These are the secrets of Love
Secrets of Love

Like a feather falling
From the blue sky
It twists and turns as it passes us by
Somehow it found us
Now we can hold it
And make a wing if we try
And we'll fly away baby
No matter where the winds of fate will take us

Don't have to weep, Come and enjoy a smile
Opening scene is just like a doorway
Here's a story, in rhythm and rhyme

There is a tree on the street and in the forest
Lavender dream whispered a poet
Bright potpourri. The envy of orchids
When it's dressed in a pink and fuchsia twine
Jacaranda tree and the Bougainvillea vine
Oh Mandela, that garden that you made
Is a vision of the prayer, you must've been prayin' everyday
Sweet Azaleas, every color every kind
And the first and the last are all divine

There is a dream of the trees and of the flowers
There is a season of peace at the borderline…
Where we're redeemed and history will crown us
Jacaranda tree and Bougainvillea vine

Oh Mandela, would you say that it's alright?
When the children play they always say, they say that we were like
Cinderella, in your garden there's a shrine
To the first and the last they're all divine

One and all, big and small, a common birth
Each and every child for all his worth
Take the one who's always last and make him first
Take these seeds. Seed the earth

OUTRO:
Comin' along
Oh what a long way we have come
Comin' along
Makin' a home for everyone
Comin' along, way down South in Africa
Look at (Study) the Jacaranda tree huggin' the Bougainvillea

I'm beginning to think
I should say never
Never, no no never
Take my advice
No never
I'm beginning to see what's missing

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
Burnin' desire, house on fire
Never, no never, never
I'm beginning to see what you talking 'bout
I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to think I was wrong

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
A forgone conclusion
Too used to losin'

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But not that your lips are burning mine
Been seein' polka dots and moonbeams

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and lit a spark
Burnin' desire
House on fire

Beware, my foolish heart
So white the ever-constant moon
Take care, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
It's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss

Your lips are much too close to mine
Beware, my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fires start
For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love
This time it's love, my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
It's hard to see on an evening such as this
For they both give the very same sensation
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss

Just saying
How your song's
Been playing
A pretty pitter patter
It lightly played
The summer rain
Upon my face

Like polka dots and ballerinas
You floated right between us
With gossamer and feathers
You fanned the flames
In (like) portraits caught
In autumn rain
Around and round
Upside-down
Are you just out for air
Or maybe somewhere hiding
Playing 'round the corner

Somewhere I read a line
Just praising
A book and a song
And how the world was brighter
When Betty came along

Around and round

There's no greater crime than wastin' your life on a boat goin' nowhere

Night after night it's so hard to believe ...
That I wake up each day next to you
Time after time in the cold mornin' light, it's good to know ...
It's good to know ... that it's true

There's no greater sin than missin' your chance ...
When it's starin' right at'ya
That look in your eye says everything and tells me I'm home

Just a photograph of yesterday
And all it's edges folded
And the corners faded sepia brown
And yet it's all I have of our past love
A post script to it's ending

Brighter days
I can see such brighter days
When every song we sang is sung again
And now we know
We know this time it's for good
And we're lovers once again
And you're near me
I can remember the rain in december
The leaves of brown on the ground
In Spain I did love and adore you
The nights filled with joy were our yesterdays
And tomorrow will bring you near me

I can recall my desire
Every reverie is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time they play that spain again

I can remember the rain in december
The leaves of brown on the ground
Our love was a spanish fiesta
The bright lights and sounds were our joy each day
And the nights were the heat of yearning

I can recall my desire every reverie
Is on fire and I get a picture of all our yesterdays
Yes today, I can say
I get a kick every time I see you gaze at me
I see moments of history
Your eyes meet mine and they dance to the melody
And we live again as if dreaming

The sound of our hearts beat like castanets

It’s typical Al Jarreau. David Foster and I basically wrote the track, the melody and all the chord changes, and David released it on an instrumental album that he did in Japan. I took the song to Al and I said, ‘Man, this is perfect for you, we gotta record this.’ Al Jarreau is a terrible lyricist. He’s awful. When it’s time for the big payoff everything turns into candy. It’s like in ‘Breakin’ Away': ‘Show me some climbing boots, show me some parachutes,’ what are you talking about, man?”""]]), ('Intro', [[""Graydon is an accomplished guitarist who played the solo on Steely Dan’s “Peg.” Here, he used a single-note muted guitar technique. Says Graydon: “If I was hired to play rhythm, and I didn’t play chords, it would be a single note thing. The best example is ‘Mornin’.‘ That’s also a harmonized part. And it’s actually four parts. Well, it’s two parts, but they’re doubled. Meaning I play the top part, and then I played it again on another track, put it in stereo, and then played the lower part, and then played it again on another track, and split it in stereo. On the JaR album, there’s a song called 'Make Somebody’ that will give the example of how the muted guitar part thing works.”""]])]"

And my dreams are drifting away

Your eyes don't shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

Your words don't mean what they used to mean
They were once inspired, now they're just routine
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love
I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci
With tears in my eyes

You look the same, you're a lot the same
But my heart says ""no, no, you're not the same""
I'm afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

I guess I'll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown's disguise
And learn to laugh like Pagliacci

Warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace
Rising to a starry height
Each star its own aurora borealis
Suddenly you held me tight
I could see the Midnight Sun

I can't explain the silver rain that found me—
Or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me
Or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found
Me, suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the Midnight Sun
Midnight Sun
Was there such a night
It's a thrill I still don't quite believe
And yet when you were gone
There was still some stardust on
My sleeve

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember
And the stars forget to shine
Or I may see the meadow in December
Icy white and crystalline
But oh my darling always I'll remember

I want to take her in my arms the ache is there so deep inside

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And my Mary wakes to love another day
And Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather
She doesn't care cause right or wrong, the love we share
We share together

Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shades of night and starlight in her hair
And as we walk, I hold her close beside me

""Enjoy yourself -- every day above ground is a good day. - ANONYMOUS, MIAMI 1981

1 A PROLOGUE
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1980, Fidel Castro -- in an effort to normalize relations with the Carter Administration -- opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their relatives in the United States. Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'
The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stiletto and in the empty black void we:

waving masses, demonstrations....

3 THE CROSSING
Sun and storm.

4 THE LANDING - KEY WEST
The flag of the United States. Choppers swooping over the ragged coastline of the Keys. Emerald waters dotted with fishing trawlers and pleasure craft, an ""America the Beautiful""-type Immigration theme surging over this.

5 THE PROCESSING
Long lines. Immigration and Nationalization Officials, customs, Public Health, FBI, Church and Relief Organizations.
Babies bawling, arguments over paperwork, refugees being
interviewed by TV news, people crying, people eating,
families huddled on floors... chaos.
The music theme continuing in stately calm as we:

A FULL and CLOSEUP OF
7 TONY MONTANA 7
the scar-faced one, in the young angry prime of his life.
We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

Over this:

VOICE #1 (o.s.)
Okay so what do you call yourself?

VOICE #2 (o.s.)
Como se llama?

MONTANA
Tony Montana...you?

VOICE #1
Where'd you learn to speak the English, Tony?

MONTANA
My old man -- he was American. Sailor. Bum.
I always know, y'know, one day I gonna come to America.
I see all the movies...
VOICE #1
So where's your old man now?

MONTANA
He's dead. He died. Somewhere...

VOICE #1
Mother?

TONY
She's dead too.

VOICE #2
What kind of work you do in Cuba, Tony?

TONY
This. That. The Army. Some construction work....

VOICE #2
Unhunh. Got any family in the States, Tony? Cousins, brother-in-law?

TONY
(a beat)
Nobody. Everybody's dead.

MAN #I
Y'ever been in jail, Tony?

TONY
Me jail? No way.

We now reveal three men in civilian clothing in the dark afternoon light of the little room. Actually it's a plywood office somewhere in the processing hall and we hear the din from the hall over the question and answer. Two of the men sit around a desk, the Third Man stands in a corner, staring at Tony, the most authoritative-looking of the three.

MAN #l
(checking off a list)
You been in a mental hospital, Tony?

TONY
(grinning)
Yeah, in the boat coming over.

MAN #1
How 'bout homosexuality, Tony? You like men, y'like to dress up like a woman?

TONY
(to Man #2)
Never tried it. What the fuck's wrong with this guy, what's he think I am?

MAN #2
Just answer the questions, Tony.

The voices of the men remain cool and collected throughout.

TONY
(to Man #1)
Fuck no.

MAN #1
Arrested? Vagrancy? Marijuana?

TONY
NO. ...NO. Never. Nothing.

His eye movements are rapid (over shoulders, sides, doors)
and he does a lot of touching -- objects -- lightly with the
tips of the fingers. Man #3 is stepping forward out of the
shadows.

MAN #3
So where'd you get the beauty scar?

TONY
This?..
(scratching the scar, shrugs)
I was a kid. You should see the other kid.
(a grim chuckle)

MAN #3
And this?

He holds up Tony's hand and indicates the tattoo between the
thumb and second finger -- a heart with the word ""Madre""
scaled through it.

TONY
Oh that was for my sweetheart.

MAN #3
Sweetheart?
(to the other men)
We been seeing more and more of these. It's some kinda code these guys used in the can. Pitchfork means an assassin
or something. This one's new... You want to tell us, Montana or you want to take a little trip to the detention center?

TONY
Hey, so I was in the can once for buying dollars. Big deal.

MAN #3
That's pretty funny, Tony.

TONY
Some Canadian tourist....

MAN #3
What'd you mug him first? Get him outta here!
(starts to walk out)

TONY
Hey, so I fuck Castro, what's it to you? You a Communist or something?
How would you like it they tell you all the time what to think, what to do, you wanna be like a sheep, like everybody else. Baa baa? Puta! You want a stoolie on every block? You wanna work eight hours a day and you never own nothing? I ate octopus three times a day, fucking octopus is coming out my ears, fuckin' Russian shoes are eating through my feet. Whaddaya want? You want me to stay there? Hey, I'm no little whore, I'm no stinking thief! I'm Tony Montana and I'm a political prisoner here from Cuba and I want my fucking 'Human Rights' just like President Jimmy Carter says, okay?

Silence.
There's a certain eloquence to the man`s plea but
it falls on disbelieving ears. One of them chuckles.

MAN #l
Carter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?

MAN #3
(walking out)
I... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him. A long look.

TONY
Hey, that's okay, too, Harry. No hard feelings.

Man #3 at the door stops, looks back.

TONY
Send me here, send me there. This.
That. Nothing you can do to me
Harry, Castro didn't do -- nothing....

That taunting smile on Tony's lips as, to the music of the
immigration theme, we:

7-A INT. FEDERAL BUS - HOUR LATER 7-A
The bus is packed with the harder-looking refugee-types.
The windows are caged and we see INS guards.
The noise level is high, like a sack of monkeys.

Manny (Manolo) Ribera's got his feet up on an empty seat.
He's big, strong, handsome, with dashing darkly feminine
eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

MANNY
Seat's taken.

TONY
So I'll sit in your lap.

Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out
of Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then
returns the empty wrapper to Manny,

TONY
So what'd you tell them?

MANNY
I told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.

TONY
I didn't tell you sanitation. I told you to tell them you was in a sanitarium, not sanitation.

The bus pulling out now.

MANNY
Is that what you told me? You didn't tell me that.

TONY
You know if you hadn't opened your mouth, they woulda thought you were a horse. I told you to tell them you had TB and was cured.

MANNY
Fuck you Tony....

TONY
You did nothing right. I shoulda left you in Cuba.

A movie projector...
...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....

The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
eyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

BOGART
What a thing.
Conscience. Conscience.
If you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you? Makes me sick so much talking and fussing about nonsense.
Time to go to sleep.
(closes his eyes
but not for long)

CUT TO

9 INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 9
Tony is moving down 23rd Street, the walk proud and jungle
in the rock of the hips and the cast of the shoulders --
now accompanied by his handsome compadre, Manny.

TONY
That Bogart, Chico, hunh?

MANNY
Fucking crazy, hunh!

TONY
That gold dust blowing in the wind.
Y'see Manny, he's always looking over his shoulder. Hunh? Like me....

He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
pop button pinned to his shirt that says ""Fuck Off and Die.""
And his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
more pronounced.

TONY
. . . don't trust nobody.

MANNY
Yeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.

TONY
Never happen to me, Chico. That's one thing I never gonna be. I never gonna be crazy like that.

MANNY
Yeah, how do you know....

TONY
I know.

MANNY
I don't know. Sometimes you crazy, too, Tony.

TONY
Assholes, I go crazy. You Manny, I never go crazy with you. You're
like my brother, I love you!

MANNY
Yeah, sure.

TONY
Hey, c'mon.

Tony playfully punches Manny and they walk on into the humid night, intersecting a young punk, Chi-Chi.

CHI-CHI
(to Manny; Spanish)
Hey Manny.

MANNY
Oye Chi-Chi, what's going down.

CHI-CHI
Usual shit. Want some peanuts? Pago's carrying tonight.

MANNY
I don't know, I get all fucked up on it....

CHI-CHI
Want some new snatch? A pussycat
name of Yolanda just rolled onto the
Boulevard ---

MANNY
Oh yeah, what she look like?

CHI-CHI
She look like you 'cept she got a snatch.

MANNY
A real snatch?

CHI-CHI
You're not kidding. It talks.

As they chatter, Tony moves on with a movement of the head
for Manny. ""Later.""

He's in the middle of the ""Boulevard"" where a bustling black
market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transvestites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack neon.

He ambles past a bunch of young guys throwing a Frisbee,
past a ""Viva Carter!"" proclamation in graffiti....

TRANSVESTITE
(passing)
What about you sugar -- you wanna party?

TONY
(passing her)
Yeah with whose cock, honey?

CUT TO

10 EXT. FREEDOMTOWN GROUNDS - NIGHT 10
Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in, trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.

Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.

VOICE
Yes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?

Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.

He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

TONY
Angel, how ya doin'?

ANGEL
You know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City? And I gotta call every fucking one of 'em to find my brother!

TONY
(in passing)
Don't waste your dime, Chico. You know your brother hates you.

ANGEL
Go fuck yourself, Tony.

Manny catches up to Tony.

TONY
Whatcha hanging around with that hustler for?

MANNY
Hey Chi-Chi's okay, he hears things,

TONY
What's he hear I don't hear.

Angel comes over, listens.

MANNY
He hears we got problems. Immigration is having these hearings, y ' know? And they're saying nine out of ten of us is gonna get shipped back!

TONY
Oh yeah?

MANNY
Yeah. And a lotta shit just went down at Indiantown Gap. In Pennsylvania. Riots, fires, broken heads... things are gonna pop here.

TONY
Shit, I coulda told you that.

MANNY
Yeah, so what do you think the immigration's gonna do when we riot? You think they're gonna let us out? They're gonna throw away the key, that's what.

ANGEL
Oh shit!

MANNY
What's I say. This is gonna end bad, muchachos....

TONY
Hey, I tell you guys this isn't Cuba here, this is the United States. They got nothing but lawyers here. We're on the television. We're in the newspapers. Whatta they gonna do -- ship us back to Cuba? Castro-- he don't want us. Nobody no place wants us so whatta they gonna do -- put us in a gas chamber so all the people can see? They're stuck with us, Chico -- they gotta let us go!

MANNY
Yeah, well, what if we gotta sit here another six months, hunh?

TONY
You worry too much, mi hermano. Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?

Tony winks and walks off.

The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.

TONY
(in awful imitation)
'Oh yeah America! Love-to love you baby, oh yeah!'

11 EXT. PLAYING FIELD - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER


Camera on Tony shuffling and feinting a soccer ball in an impromptu game; he's covered with sweat, tires a fancy move
around a younger kid who not only steals the ball away off him but manages to lay him flat on his face.

TONY
(lying there)
Aw fuck....

The game, leaving him behind, shifts downfield.

MANNY
Aye ! Tony! C'mon!

Manny, just arrived at the edge of the field, waves him off.
Tony, getting up, brushing himself off, walks off the field
towards him.

ANGEL
(at a distance)
Hey Tony where ya going?

TONY
I got better things to do.

ANGEL
Chicken liver, hunh?

TONY
(to Manny)
Yeah?

(looking zd)
Let's walk.

They walk.

MANNY
You ready for the good news, cone?

TONY
Yeah.

MANNY
We can be outta here in thirty days.
Not only that. We got a green card and a job in Miami! Hunh? We're made, Chico, we're made?

TONY
Yeah, whadda we gotta do, go to Cuba and hit the Beard or what?

Angel is walking towards them. Tony signals him.

MANNY
(shakes his head)
Forget it. Oh yeah -- there's a hundred greenbacks in it, For both of us.

TONY
(enthusiastic)
Hey you're kidding, that's great!
But Manny, you tell your guys Angel gets out with us.

cigarette, eyes roving as the guard examines his papers.

Others set fire to their mattresses.

are moving through the gates, restoring order. Loudspeakers
blast. Injured refugees lie bleeding on the grounds.

24 AN ENTIRE BARRACK
now goes up in flames.

25 INSIDE THE BARRACK
A bewildered Emilio Rebenga grabs his papers and valuables.

Manny runs up on him.

Rebenga sees him, senses danger, flees down the aisle with his satchel, intersecting other panicked refugees.

Manny follows.
Rebenga stumbles into a bed frame, shatters his glasses,
then runs on. Into the smoke and flame. Out of which Scarface now appears -- in his killing wrath.

TONY
Rebenga!

Rebenga snaps to the sound of the voice.

TONY
(Spanish)
From the friends you fucked!

The work is fast. The stiletto punches nine quick holes in his lungs and his heart...  And the figure of death is gone.

...And Emilio Rebenga staggers wildly in the smoke, uncomprehending eyes encased in broken glasses. Sinking out of frame.

An Immigration Officer passes a sheaf of documents across a desk into a pair of hands. The camera gliding along a Green Card pinned to the top of the stack.

It says ""ANTHONY MONTANA"" and it has picture and stamps. It's official, as the camera moves with triumphant immigration theme music to the face of Mr. Montana examining quite contentedly the rewards of his efforts.

End of montage. Music continues.

27-A EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a
beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white
clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Banco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American leaving Miami please bring flag?""

Tony and Manny bop along the street in their hand-me-down
clothes, oogling the chicas and the bodegas (in a plush
modern area of Miami). Boats. Buildings. Cars.

TONY
(looking around)
Boy -- can you believe this place, Chico?

MANNY
(Spanish)
Man, they weren't kidding around.

TONY
(pointing to a little old man walking towards them)
See that old guy over there?

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
Millionaire.

MANNY
How do you know?

TONY
Go over there. Ask him gimme some money. He'll give you the silver right outta his pants -- that's America man, that's what they do here.

MANNY
(almost believing)
Yeah? Hey Tony catch this tomato.
(adjusting his pants)
Ooooh baby doll...

A hot Cuban girl in heels comes down the sidewalk towards
them with a female friend.

TONY
Hey baby what you say?

She looks at him like he was the last thing in the world
she'd say anything to.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch me. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....

TONY
Oooh... cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

27-B EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY
Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arm
and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
give a shit.

TONY
Come on?

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
and walks away.

Tony walks over to him, mocking.

TONY
Pobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.
This country first you gotta get the money, then you get
the power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls. Por los conjones.

MANNY
There you go talking big again man. You don't know shit about the world. Who was it got us the green card, who got us the friends with the connections, hunh -- who's getting us a job? You or me? Not you man. You lucky you have any friends. You lucky to have me as a friend....

As they walk off, backs to camera.

TONY
Yeah, so where's this job?

MANNY
Don't push man, my friends gonna take care of everything.

on Southwest 8th Street. ""Calle Ocho""....

The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every table is taken. It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.

The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
this dungeon....

. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and
Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
exhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

TONY
Your big shot friend better come up with something soon. I didn't come to America to break my fucking back, querido.

MANNY
(equally irritated)
Hey he's coming okay! What do you want?

29 INT./EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT - HOURS LATER
We are looking through a cubbyhole at the diners. Young
Cuban guys with chiquitas drift in with their fancy clothes,
diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.

Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and
Manny, wiping the sweat off their faces with towels.

MANNY
Look at that chick man, wow! Look at them knockers.

TONY
Yeah, look at the punk with her.
What's he got that I don't got?

MANNY
He's good-looking that's what, look at his clothes, flash Chico, pizzazz! A little coke money don't hurt nobody...

TONY
Junkie! -- They got no fuckin' character.

Cono! Look at these... fucking Onions! They outta be picking gold off the streets.

His hands are shriveled white from dishwater.

TONY

El Mono? Shit....

CUT TO
30 EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Omar Suarez (El Mono -- ""The Monkey"") is so named cause he
looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

MANNY
(leaning in the window)
Hey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....

Waldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move back to Manny.

OMAR
I got something for you.

MANNY
Oh yeah! That's great... What do we gotta do?

OMAR
We gotta unload a boat -- grass, twenty-five tons -- that's what we gotta do. You get five hundred each.

MANNY
Okay!
(to Tony)
See, what'd I tell you.

TONY
You gotta be kidding! Whaddayou think we are -- baggage handlers?

Omar looks at him somewhat incredulously as Tony wipes his hands on his greasy apron as he talks.

TONY
...five hundred dollars -- shit!
What'd I do for you guys in the slammer, hunh? What was the Rebenga hit -- game of dominoes or somethin'? You're talkin' to important guys here.

MANNY
(shocked)
Hey Tony, c'mon, it's okay Omar, we...

TONY
Shaddup!

Omar sniggers, his eyes shifting to Waldo who shakes his
head and laughs.

OMAR
(to Manny only)
So what's it with this dishwasher, Chico? Don't he think we coulda gotten some other space cadet to do Rebenga -- cheaper maybe. Fifty bucks?

TONY
(shrugs)
So why didn't you? And who the fuck you calling a dishwasher, I'll wipe your monekyshit ass all up and down this Boulevard.

Steps forward. Manny grabs him.

MANNY
Hey! -- Tony, Tony....

In the car, Omar looks over at Waldo.

OMAR
Guy's a lunatic, let's go.

WALDO
What about them Indians ---

The idea crosses Omar's mind, He buys it, somewhat amused.

OMAR
Yeah...
(back to Tony)
All right, smart ass, you wanna make some big bucks? You know anything about cocaine?

TONY
You kidding.

OMAR
...There's a bunch of Columbians. Flying in Friday. New guys. They say they got two keys for us for openers. Pure coke. In a motel over in Miami Beach. I want you to go over there, and if it's what they say it is, pay 'em and bring it back. You do that, you'll make five grand.

MANNY
(to Tony)
Hey, that sounds great, Tony...

Tony says nothing.

OMAR
You know how to handle a machine gun?

MANNY
Sure, we was in the Army together.

OMAR
You're gonna need a couple other guys...

MANNY
No problem.

OMAR
Meet me at Hector's bodega Friday at noon. You get the money then. Something happens to the money, pobrecito, and my boss' gonna stick your head up your asses faster'n a rabbit gets fucked.

Throws the remains of his cigarette at their feet and pulls the Coupe De Ville out of the lot.

TONY
I'm scared.

MANNY
(relieved)
Tony you're pushin' your luck.

TONY
(walking away)
You worry too much Manny -- you' re gonna get yourself a heart attack one of these days.

MANNY
(catching up)
Yeah, so who are these Colombians?

TONY
So what does it matter?

MANNY
So whatcha have that look on for when Omar bring it up?

Tony strips off his greasy apron.

TONY
So nothin'. I just don't like fuckin' Colombians that's what.
They're animals!

COOK
(intersecting, Spanish)
Where you greasers going, hunh, I got plenty of plates here.

TONY
Wash yourself. I just retired.

Throws the Cook his apron.

COOK
(Spanish)
What the fuck you gonna do!

TONY
Look after my investments.

CUT TO
31 EXT. MIAMI BEACH - DAY - MOVING SHOT
The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
street.

The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
needing paint. You'd arrest these guys on sight.

32 INT./EXT. TONY'S CADILLAC - MIAMI BEACH - DAY
seen from the inside of the sedan. Tony turns down the salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely. Manny is driving. In the dilapidated backseat are Angel, the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

Manny, reflecting the tension, whistles a rapid series of notes under his breath as he waits for a light to change.

MANNY
Hey look at that chick, hunh? Lookit those tits man, she's begging for it!

At the curb, an old crone hunchbacks her way in front of the teenage chick, who is coming off the beach in a bikini, blocking her off.

CHI-CHI
(looking over)
Whatta you crazy? She's 103 years old.

MANNY
Not her stupido! Her....

Camera revealing the teenager.

TONY
(the light changing)
Drive, willya.

MANNY
(mocking)
Sure, sure. Not to worry, Tony -- You get a heart attack.
(looking in the rearview mirror)
Angel, whatcha wearing the face for?

ANGEL
(tense, making light of it)
Ah, it's okay. I just y'know forgot to make an offering. I was supposed to go by the madrina today.

MANNY
You still going to that cuncha?

ANGEL
She knows her shit. She talks to Yemaya and Chango like nobody y'ever heard.

As he talks Angel fingers a Negrita charm hanging around
his neck -- Chango, God of Fire and Thunder, his black face
tilted at a carnal angle. Sharp teeth glinting, his eyes
rolling in orgasmic imagery, his head crowned with gold.
Many of the Marielitos in the film will be wearing this,
also pendants with an eye to ward off the evil spirits, red
and white beads, red kerchiefs, black hand charms silver-
bangled bracelets, etc., all relating to their Afro-Catholic
spiritualism.

MANNY
(making fun)
Yeah, Chango looking out for us,

CHI-CHI
Angel?

ANGEL
Chango looking out for all the 'bandidos' everywhere. But you gotta pay him his dues, y'know. You gotta let him know you respect him. You don't, Chango -- he gets pissed an'...

TONY
(angry)
Hey, shaddup -- all of ya! I told you before I don't go for that mystical voodoo shit. That's for the old cunchas waving their rooster cocks in some dark alley, There's no gods, there's no Chango -- nowhere! You make your own luck. So shaddup and act like you're in the United States here.

Silence. Through the windshield, the sign of a motel -- THE SUN RAY -- is coming closer.

TONY
Okay, this is it. Pull over across the street.
The motel is coming closer in silence.

TONY
(to Manny)
Money stays in the trunk till I come out and get it. Me. Nobody else. If I'm not out in fifteen minutes, something's wrong. I'm in Room 9. You ready, Angelito?

ANGEL
Sure thing.

As Manny pulls the car up, they pull out Ingram Model-10
machine pistol with folding butt and suppressor, ten inches
of kill power capable of firing 1100 rounds a minute -- it
can be slipped into a man's purse, it's in vogue. Tony getting out, to Angel:

TONY
Let's go....

CUT TO

33 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony and Angel come slowly, gingerly down an exterior
corridor to a room marked ""9"". Nodding to Angel who remains in the stairwell with the Ingram machine pistol, Tony knocks.
Pause.

34 EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-inch Colombian, ""The Toad"". He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.

TOAD
Hey, oye amigo....

Spreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.

35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Tony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and
blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.

TONY
(as he steps in)
How you doing amigo...?

The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
Colombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, ""The Lizard""; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.

The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

TONY
(checking out the room)
Mind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?

Toad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,
the conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.

TOAD
Sure, no problem... This is Marta.

TONY
Hello, Marta.
She nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the
television set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists
intermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.

TOAD
I'm Hector...

Pause.

TONY
Yeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.

TOAD
Yeah, Omar's okay.

TONY
You know Omar.

TOAD
Omar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.

TONY
Okay...

TOAD
Okay... so you got the money?

TONY
Yeah, you got the stuff?

TOAD
Sure I got the stuff, but I don't
got it right here with me. I got it
close by.

TONY
Yeah well I don't got it either, I
got it close by, too.

TOAD
Where, in the parking lot?

TONY
No. How far's your stuff?

Tony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel
out... The Lizard staring at him...

TOAD
Not far.

Pause. Everything seems okay.

TONY
So what do we do, walk in and start over?

TOAD
(changes subject)
Where you from?

Tony's eyes check out the bathroom.

TONY
What fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?

TOAD
I like to get to know who I do business with.

It's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a
move somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,
coiled and always watching.

TONY
You get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.

TOAD
Hey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...

TONY
Okay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?

36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
There's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then
commotion.

ANGEL
Tony!

Tony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening
female shriek, like a bird.

LIZARD
(slang Spanish)
Don't! Get up! Now shithead!

She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.

The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
Columbians, ""The Kids"".

They slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.

As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

TONY
Frog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.

Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

TOAD
Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?

TONY
Try sticking your head up your ass.
See if it fits.

Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
pulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins
assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

CUT TO:

37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across
the street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.

38 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
sees nothing, casually goes back in.

39 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny looks at his watch.

CUT TO

40 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

Tony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
bathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
Angel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're
dead and they know it.

Toad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.

TOAD
(to Tony)
You watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.

Lizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who
nods and turns on the whirring machine.

The Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly
towards Angel.

The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his
brains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

Lizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.

The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.

TOAD
Now the leg, hunh?

A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

CUT TO

41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with
Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They
signal and separate.

CUT TO

42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.

Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.

TOAD
Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.

He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
his blood, piss dead.

CUT TO

43 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Manny moves crouched down the exterior corridor, Ingram
pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to
notice.

At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens...

CUT TO

44 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - 'DAY
The kids are starting to strap Tony up to the top of the
shower.

The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

TOAD
Last chance, carajo?

Tony, devastated, spits in his face.

TONY
Go fuck yourself.

Toad's eyes narrow meanly.

Kid one slaps the tape across Tony's mouth.

Kid two reaches up to tighten the overhead strap to Tony's
wrist.

The Toad turns on his chainsaw when suddenly there's a
gunshot from the hall.

45 INT./EXT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She crashes backwards into the room, wounded. Everything happens very fast now.

Manny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid
one, who is turning, in the neck.

Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.

The Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.

Manny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.

Manny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.

The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
him. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.

In sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.

Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.

In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.

Chi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.

Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.

He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

Tony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.

TONY
I got him!

Manny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.

Chi-Chi sees Angel, gags.

CUT TO
46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46
The senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter
in astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

Their eyes follow.

As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
that counts. He stands behind the Toad.

TONY
(Spanish)
Your turn, cabron!

The Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.

Tony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.

The bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then
an old lady faints.

The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.

CUT TO

47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY
Tony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.

TONY
Manny, you okay?

Manny nods.

TONY
Chi-Chi, get the car. Fast!

CHI-CHI
Si!

48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM
Tony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies
and busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which
the Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.

Inside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.

He shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.

CUT TO
49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY

Chi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony
hurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)

Past the senior citizens who are retreating inside their
rooms.

The camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars
come screaming past them from the opposite direction.

CUT TO
50 EXT. LITTLE HAVANA RESTAURANT - PHONE BOOTH - DUSK
The booth is in the busy parking lot, Tony on the phone, Chi-Chi and Manny wait in the sedan.

TONY
Yeah, bunch of cowboys! ...somebody fucked up Omar.

OMAR'S VOICE
(shaken)
Look, let me check it out right away!

TONY
You do that, Omar, you do that.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the money?

TONY
Yeah -- and I got the yeyo.

OMAR'S VOICE
You got the yeyo? Bring it here.

TONY
Fuck you. I'm taking it to the boss myself. Not you. Me.

OMAR'S VOICE
Okay, okay. All right. Frank's gonna wanna see you anyway. Look, meet me tonight at Hector's at eight.

TONY
Hey Omar...

OMAR'S VOICE
Yeah?

TONY
That was some pick up you sent us on.

Pause.

OMAR'S VOICE
What's that mean?

Tony hangs up, walks back to the sedan.

CUT TO

51 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - SOUTH MIAMI - NIGHT
on Bricknell Avenue in a swank high-rise district adjacent
Coconut Grove and Coral Gables, the hub of South Miami...

The doorman shows Omar, Manny, his side bandaged, and Tony, carrying the suitcase, through giant glass portals, past seriously armed security cops in the lobby.

52 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - NIGHT 52
A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor, dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Manny, with a phony effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?

TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.

LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.

TONY
Okay Frank.

Frank shakes hands with Manny.

LOPEZ
Howya doing?

MANNY
(awed)
...Fine yeah.

TONY
Manny Ray, he was with us on the job.

LOPEZ
(to Manny)
I hear you caught one?

Manny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.

MANNY
Just the flesh. Went right through.

LOPEZ
(heading for the bar)
Yeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.

TONY
(glances at Omar)
Yeah. Omar's terrific.

LOPEZ
Not to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.

TONY
You don't have to mention it. That was fun.

LOPEZ
(smiles, likes the kid's balls)
Scotch? Gin? Rum?

TONY
Gin's fine.

LOPEZ
(pouring)
Yeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.

TONY
Yeah... well.

Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.

TONY
...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.
(produces the money)
It's my gift to you -- from me.

Pause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.

LOPEZ
It's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....

He glances hard at Omar who squirms.

Without opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes
the suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.

LOPEZ
Don't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!

They drink the toast. With their eyes.

LOPEZ
Then you find out your biggest head ache's not bringing in the stuff but figuring out what to do with all the goddamn cash.
(drinks)

TONY
Yeah, I hope I have that problem someday.

Lopez looks, distracted., down the corridor from which he came, to Ernie, the bodyguard.

LOPEZ
Where the hell's Elvira? Go get her, will you, Ernie?

The big bodyguard exits smoothly.

LOPEZ
(to the others)
The broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.

TONY
I guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
Yeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?
(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)

TONY
Yeah sure, I could eat a horse.

ERNIE
Here she comes, Mr. Lopez.

TONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.

LOPEZ
Oooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.

She doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.

**ALTERNATIVE**
LOPEZ
Where you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.

ELVIRA
You're always hungry, you should try starving.

Lopez laughs.

LOPEZ
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Tony Montana... Elvira... Manny Ribera.

ELVIRA
Hello.

TONY
Uh... hi.

MANNY
(equally impressed)
Yeah, hi.

ELVIRA
I assume we're going to be a fivesome.
Where are we having dinner?

FRANK
Oh, I thought we'd eat at the Babylon.

ELVIRA
Again? If anyone wanted to assassinate
you, you wouldn't be too hard to find.

LOPEZ
(coming toward her, laughing)
Me? Who'd want to kill me? I got nothing but friends.

ELVIRA
You never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.

Neatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.

ELVIRA
Come on, Frank, let's go.

Tracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.

Lopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.

LOPEZ
Okay, let's go.

CUT TO
54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.

55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
The interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.

The crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
young, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, ""Celebrating"" or ""Partying Down Tonight"".

The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
and high heels.

Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
tough-looking tank tops with ""Motherfuckah"" and ""Fuck Me""
written on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.

MANNY
So whaddaya say, hunh?

He flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.

CHICK
You got a buck?

MANNY
Sure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?

CHICK
(indicates the machine)
Put it in, let's play.

MANNY
I had other things in mind.

CHICK
You check out on this and we'll talk about other things.

MANNY
(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)
Fuck, how do you play this thing?

CUT TO
56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56
Frank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug
of champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Over there that's Ronnie Echeverria.
Him and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....

Their point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.

LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.

Their point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.

LOPEZ
...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....

Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.

LOPEZ
. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?

TONY
'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?

LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.

ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.

The girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.

LOPEZ
That's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.
(eyeing Elvira)

HEAD WAITER
There you go, Mr. Lopez.

He's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.

LOPEZ
Give it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?

Head Waiter nods.

LOPEZ
(to Tony)
Five hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh? For a bunch of fucking grapes -- isn't that something?

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
In France, it cost $100 but don't tell anybody in Miami.

Tony catches her eye. She looks away, interested.

57 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
A Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.

LOPEZ
Hey, George -- buddy.

MAN
Hey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?

The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.

LOPEZ
Oy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.

SHEFFIELD
Jack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.

LOPEZ
Yeah, almost everything.

SHEFFIELD
(to Elvira)
Elvira, you look terrific...
(to all)
Enjoy yourselves.

He ambles off.

LOPEZ
. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.

Tony looking off at him, remembering it.

LOPEZ
(raising his champagne glass)
So... here's to old friends...and new friends.

They toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.

LOPEZ
Well, Tony?

TONY
Hey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.

Lopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.

LOPEZ
(checking Tony's threads)
Yeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp. I'd like you and your boys to handle some stuff for me, Tony, work with Omar here. We're doing something big next month. Running a string of mules out of Columbia. You do good on that, there'll be other things.

Omar doesn't like it but glances away.

TONY
Hey, that sounds like fun, Frank. Thanks.

The music shifts to slow dancing.

ELVIRA
(waving away cigar smoke)
So, you want to dance, Frank or you want to sit here and have a heart attack?

LOPEZ
Dance? I'd rather have a heart attack.

ELVIRA
(rising)
Don't foam into the Dom Perignon.

Glancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.

ELVIRA
(to Tony)
How about you?

Tony nods sure, looks at his boss.

LOPEZ
(waves)
Go on!

They go.

58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT
It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.

LOPEZ
(to Omar)
What do you think?

OMAR
I think he's a fucking peasant.

LOPEZ
Yeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.

CUT TO
59 INT. BABYLON CLUB DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 59
Tony and Elvira are dancing semiclose to a slow Billy Joel
dance tune. He's no great shakes as a dancer, leaden in
the legs and shoulders.

TONY
...so what's your name, Elvira what?

ELVIRA
St. James.

TONY
Elvira St. James. Sounds like a nun or something. So where you from?

He bumps into an elderly couple dancing, ignores them.

ELVIRA
Baltimore...

TONY
Baltimore? Where's that?

ELVIRA
Look, it doesn't really matter. I'm getting a headache.

TONY
Just trying to be friendly.

ELVIRA
I've got enough friends -- and I don't need another one, 'specially one who just got off the banana boat.

He makes a point of looking at her.

TONY
Hey, I didn't come over on no banana boat. I'm a political refugee here.

ELVIRA
Oh, part of the Cuban crime wave?

Tony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.
The man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony
doesn't see.

TONY
Whatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?

ELVIRA
(interrupting)
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were so sensitive about your diplomatic status.

TONY
Why you got this beef against the world? You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?

Elvira laughs at him, furious.

ELVIRA
You know you're even stupider than you look. Let me give you a crash course, Jose whatever your name is, so you know what you're doing around here.

TONY
(interrupting)
Now you're talking to me, baby!

ELVIRA
First who, where, why and how I fuck is none of your business, second don't call me 'baby,' I'm not your baby and last, even if I was blind, desperate, starved and begging for it on a desert island, you'd be the last thing I'd ever fuck. You got the picture now -- so fuck off.

TONY
Hey, thataway.

She whips off the floor, pissed. He watches her, amused.

CUT TO

63 CAR - DAWN
Tony and Manny drive home in the broken down Monte Carlo sedan through the streets of Little Havana.

They've been partying all night, clothes rumpled, Tony smoking his cigar, feeling good.

TONY
That chick he's with... she loves me.

MANNY
(driving)
Oh yeah, how you know that?

TONY
The eyes, Manny -- they don't lie.

MANNY
You're serious? Tony, that's Lopez's lady. He'll kill us.

TONY
What are you kidding -- he's soft.
I seen it in his face -- booze and a cuncha tells him what to do.

Pause.

63-A OMITTED

64 EXT. DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER
The new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,
the camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,
huge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:

HOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?
COME TALK TO US...
AT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...
TODAY!

Past banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...

Insert a car sticker going by with the image of the
American flag and the reminder: ""Will the last American
leaving Miami please bring the flag?""

Tony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.

TONY
I shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...

MANNY
I want a line of bluejeans with my name on the
chicks' asses.

TONY
Yeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,
We never gonna score the big money working for Frank.

MANNY
Frank's okay.

TONY
Yeah -- cause he buys you a suit? You thinkin' like
a chickenhead again

MANNY
Frank's got an organization.

TOW
Organization? I got more brains than Omar and he's bigger than me, That's not an organization. That`s a disorganization. What do you do for a brain man? Piss in it?

MANNY
Fuck you, somebody oughta shoot you, put you outta your misery
(seeing something)
Hey catch this tomato

Catching the eye of one of two young Girls passing, Manny
primps for them.

MANNY
Ooooh baby doll

TONY
Yeah, what do you girls say? you manna have some
ice cream with us somewhere?

They glance at Tony and Manny and hurry on.

Tony waves her off, then changes his mind and runs up
behind her and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
Before she can react, he hops away laughing as the two
Cuban girls ad-lib Spanish expletives at him.

MANNY
Hey that's not cool, man. You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!

He wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small
whirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in
the flick of an eye.

TONY
...the fuck was that?

MANNY
You didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.

Does it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head
peeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.

TONY
What the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin',

MANNY
You think so hunh? Well you did know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.

Does it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility,
provoking Manny's laughter. Manny double checks himself in a shop window.

MANNY
(doing it again)
Takes practice, mi sengre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it...

TONY
Oooh ...cono! How 'bout that one?

Pointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.

MANNY
No problem.

EXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.

Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.

TONY
Come on!

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
car screeching to a halt in front of him.

TONY
(points)
Okay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.

Tony walks up to him, mocking.

TONY
I'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.
This country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls. Por Los cojonesl

MANNY
Hey Tony, last time this year you was in a fuckin' cage in Cuba. Why don't you take it easy Chico, slow down, one step at a time, be happy what you got you know? You get on your death bed you look around you think to yourself, when was I ever happy?

Camera moving with Tony as he glances in an elegant window displaying jewelry.

TONY
You be happy. I want what's comin' to me when I'm alive not when I'm dead.

MANNY (shakes his head)
Yeah, what's comin' to you Tony?

TONY
The world man, and everything in it.

As he goes into the store, the camera panning to the diamonds in the window.

CUT TO

65 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY
The house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.

66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY
From his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced
up and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of
gifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.

TONY
Be back in an hour okay.

MANNY
Okay... be cool.

Tony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.

67 EXT./INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
Tony's Mother opens the door.
A stout aging woman with a powerful face, she's shook to her roots.

TONY
(gently, in Spanish)
Mami... long time....

MAMS
No postcards from jail, hunh?

He doesn't offer to kiss her nor she him.

Pause.

Someone else is in the house. Mother looks behind her.
She opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.
He steps in. He looks.

68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.

TONY
(moved)
Hi Gina...

GINA
Tony?

She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
Tony's possession.)

TONY
(covering his unwanted emotion)
Yeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....

He holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.

TONY
I got this for you, no big deal but....

GINA
Oh Tony!

Gina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his
arms, grasping him fiercely.

GINA
...it's you!

Tony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.

GINA
I never thought I'd see you again -- never!

Tony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.

TONY
Hey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?

Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.

TONY
...Yeah for you...and look -- here.
What I got written on it....
""To Gina From Tony. Always.""

GINA
It's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....

The mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls
out another present, for her.

TONY
...for you too Mama, look....

Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
exquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.

GINA
It's beautiful... Mama,
(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')

Mama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.

TONY
(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)
Well anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!

Tossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a
bottle of champagne.

TONY
Oye ! To America!
(singing)
'America. America....'

CUT TO
69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Mama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,
as Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.

GINA
. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?

Tony nods.

GINA
It's his place. Plus I'm going to junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in two more years I get my cosmetology license and then I'll be making enough...

TONY
Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
with starting today. I didn't bring
up my kid sister to work in no hair
shop....

Mama looks over at him on the words ""bring up"" and he
catches her look.

TONY
...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.

He pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and
starts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,
looks.

TONY
(to Mama as he counts)
Yeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise
you. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.

Pushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.

TONY
That's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.

She approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the
bills, then looks back at her son.

MAMA
Who'd you kill for this Tony?

GINA
(aghast)
Mama!

TONY
I didn't kill nobody Mama,
(lying)

MAMA
No? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?

TONY
C'mon Mama. Things are different.
I'm working with this anti-Castro group.
I'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....

MAMA
Sure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....

GINA
(springing to her feet)
What are you saying Mama! He's your son!

MAMA
Son? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a
bum now!
(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)
Who do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?
You think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....

TONY
Hey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....

MAMA
(continuing)
No, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --
(emphasizing it)
I raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy
money with you, it stinks!

She casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him
like dead lettuce.

A silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.

GINA
Oh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.
(to Tony)
I'm sorry Tony, I....

Tony nods his head at his mother.

TONY
(gently)
Okay, Mama, okay....

70 EXT. TONY'S MOTHERS HOUSE - NIGHT 70

Tony walks out icily.

MANNY
(waiting in the car, seeing his expression)
Relatives, hunh? A pain in the ass,
they ---

TONY
Shaddup!

He's climbing into the car when Gina hurries out the house.

GINA
Tony!

MANNY
Hey who's that?
Checks himself in the rearview mirror, slicks his hair.

Tony and Gina talk next to the car.

GINA
Tony-.-Mama -- since Papa took off....

TONY
Hey forget Papa, we never had one, okay? He was a bum!

GINA
(continuing)
. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?

TONY
(making light of it now)
Hey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.

GINA
Tony, I know you did some bad things
back then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.

TONY
Communists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.

GINA
Mama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.

Pause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.

TONY
Hey I know... I know.

She gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.

TONY
Say, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?

She hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.

TONY
Go on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?

He gets in the car. She peers in.

GINA
You can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?

Her eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.
He smiles back with charm.

Gina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw. The sedan drives off.

71 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 71

MANNY

Hey,

73 U.S. CUSTOMS - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY 73
Tony, spruce in his new three-piece suit with the diamond on
the finger and the expensive watch, looks like the young
ethnic American businessman in import-export as he steps in
front of a chunky, young Customs Officer, who looks at him coldly.

CUSTOMS OFFICER
Mind opening that, sir?

Tony, calm, unzips the chic leather single suitcase, his
eyes drifting around....
A woman, with a child and toy panda in a baby carriage, is cursorily checked through an adjacent line.
A nun is waived through the third line.
A stockbroker waiting in a fourth line, glances nervously in Tony's direction.
Tony looks away, back at the Officer who is thoroughly
ransacking the suitcase looking for a false bottom. He waits, confident.
An old man is waived through a fifth line,

75 EXT. DOLLY STASH'S HOUSE - MIAMI - DAY 75
The mother-type unscrews the handles of the baby carriage,
pulling out the wrapped cocaine, while Chi-Chi extricates
another load from the kid's panda bear which is now in
shreds.


76 THE OLD MAN 76
helped by Rafi, is removing a sophisticated false bottom
from his suitcase, laminated and difficult to detect.

While:

79 THE FORMER NUN 79

The nun, now a housewife, going through an exit gate carrying hand luggage.

82 TONY 82
watching, glances up at the electronic information board and the boarding gate--
Houston clocks out the time.-- we move to Los Angeles -- ""on time"" ---

Tony's eyes moving to the mother, now without the child,
buying her ticket at the counters.
Manny joins him, nodding okay.
Tony, with a glance at his watch, starts out the terminal.
The roar of the aircraft blending with city sounds as we continue the rapid pace of the montage with music.

86 EXT. GOLF COURSE - MIAMI - DAY 86
Frank Lopez has Tony and Chi-Chi out on the golf course. Tony never played before and gets frustrated, swings his club at the ball like a baseball bat -- Lopez getting a kick out of him. Chi-Chi naturally makes a perfect putt, shrugging when Tony looks over at him amazed.

87 INT. LAUNDRY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 87
The plush millionaire's restaurant is to be seen again.
Frank has his arm around Tony, introducing him to a business-type. Elvira looks on.

88 INT. HIGH-FASHION STORE - DAY 88
In a high-fashion store, Tony buys a beautiful dress for Gina who is delighted when she sees herself in the mirror, hugs Tony. Manny watches, unable to take his eyes off her.

SALESLADY

Your wife looks terrific in that.

TONY
My wife? You gotta be kidding.

89 INT. LOBBY - LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 89
Elvira steps out in a Pucci summer dress, looks around. Tony is waiting for her. She's surprised.

TONY
He got held up at the golf club. He told me to pick you up. He`ll meet us at the race track.

Elvira contemplating him with distaste.

TONY
He said if he was late to get Ice Cream first.

She sighs, walks across the lobby. He follows.

90 EXT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 90

Elvira steps out of the lobby into the driveway.  He points.

TONY
Over there....

She looks. The car is a yellow Cadillac convertible with 2
big fins and Snoopy the dwarf dashboard statue with stickers
all over the fenders. Adding to the impression are Manny
and Chi-Chi waiting in the backseat.

ELVIRA
(registers it with distaste)
That thing? You must be kidding.

TONY
(hurt)
Whaddaya mean, that's a Cadillac.

ELVIRA
I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing.

TONY
It's got a few years on it but it's 'a creampuff.'

ELVIRA
It looks like somebody's nightmare.

91 INT. LUXURY MOTOR SALES - CORAL GABLES - DAY 91
Camera moves around a slick, red Jaguar -- XG 6 -- with Tony, accompanied by Manny, Chi-Chi, the Salesman. Elvira waits aloofly off to the side.

TONY
(to Elvira)
So you like this better?

ELVIRA
(shrugs)
It's got style.

TONY
Yeah it looks like one of the tigers from India.

MANNY
(to Elvira)
Tony been dragging me around to the zoos, looking at tigers. He wants to buy one of them too.
(amused)
He do that he gonna have no friends left. Not that he got any now.

TONY
You'll like the tiger Manny, you'll see.

ELVIRA
You going to drive around with a tiger in your passenger seat Tony?

TONY
Yeah... maybe some lady tiger.
(to Salesman)
How much?

SALESMAN
Twenty-eight thousand dollars. Fully equipped.

TONY
(genuinely)
That all?

SALESMAN
Machine gun turrets are extra.

TONY
(circling the car)
Funny guy hunh... Manny, c'mere.

Manny comes over and Tony walks him along the car, in
quieter tones.

TONY
Get these sections bullet-proofed... here... here... these windows...

MANNY
Yeah.

TONY
...and a phone with a scrambler.

MANNY
Okay...

TONY
...And one of those radio scanners, y'know, pick out flying saucers and stuff.

MANNY
Yeah, a good one.

ELVIRA
(joining them)
Don't forget the fog lights.

TONY
Yeah, in case I go to the swamps, good idea.

ELVIRA
(impatiently)
I thought you were taking me to Frank?

TONY
(glances at his watch)
We still got an hour. You hungry?

ELVIRA
No, but I'm bored.

TONY
Figgers. Check it out, will you Manny and pay the guy and grab a
taxi out to the track....

Thanks, yeah....

TONY
(before leaving)
Oh yeah.

He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private joke. He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same sticker we saw earlier of the American flag with the epitaph, ""Will the Last American leaving Miami please bring the flag.""

Elvira wonders about it as he joins her.

TONY
Somebody gotta keep the animals out.

92 EXT. LUXURY MOTORS - DAY 92
Tony leads her to his yellow Cadillac convertible parked out of eyesight of the others.

TONY
I'm glad you came. I wouldn't buy the car you didn't like it.

ELVIRA
Planning on driving the girls crazy, aren't you?

TONY
Yeah -- you know who.
They get in the car.

ELVIRA
And what would Frank say?

She has a coke vial out, casually hits one nostril, then
other, then takes a last hit through the mouth.

TONY
I like Frank.. -but I like you better.

He reaches over and takes the coke from her. Does a toot,
staring at her. She's uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her. She leans to take it. He
kisses her. She goes with it.

Pause. She pulls back.

ELVIRA
(same tone of voice as before)
Don't get confused, Tony. I don't fuck around with the help.

As he puts the key into the ignition, Tony has this wolfish grin on his face.

CUT TO
INT. COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93
Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.

Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.

SOSA
So this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady
market. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...

Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose.
Pause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.

SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.

OMAR
That's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.

SOSA
Yes, it would've been nice if he could have come.

TONY
(cutting in)
and he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?

SOSA
(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)
So he sent you?

TONY
Yeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.

Looking over the laboratory like it was his.
Omar glances at him, annoyed.

SOSA
We'll talk at my house. Shall we go...

CUT TO
94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94
The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

SOSA
(to Omar)
...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.

OMAR
Well, we do that, we gotta take the
risk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You
know what that means?

TONY
That means we gotta go to war with
`em.
looks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make
Sosa
of this guy.
SOSA
When we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.

TONY
Split the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.

SOSA
Panama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.

TONY
13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You
know what that's like these days?
They got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.

Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

SOSA
What do you suggest is a fair...?
Excuse me.

Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
appears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves
him in.

The black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.

Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
A beat.
He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

OMAR
(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)
Shaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!

Tony shrugs.

SOSA
Where were we?

TONY
Panama. You're looking for a partner, right?

Omar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.

SOSA
...something like that.
(chuckles)

OMAR
Look Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...

TONY
Hey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.

OMAR
Hey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!

TONY
(shrugs)
Frank'll love it. Don't worry about it.

OMAR
That's up to Frank -- not you.

He looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing
-- also an advantage in the split.

OMAR
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...

SOSA
It's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to
Frank.

OMAR
(a beat)
Okay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.

SOSA
(without hesitation)
Good. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.
You can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.

Omar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.

OMAR
Yeah. I guess so....

TONY
Great.

SOSA
(glancing at Tony, to Omar)
...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.

OMAR
(doesn't get it)
I don't think that...

TONY
(lighting a cigar)
Hey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...

Sosa laughs. Omar scowls.

CUT TO

95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95

The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:
Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.

The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
polo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a
horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.

Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

TONY
You know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?

SOSA
Why?

TONY
Cause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.

Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

TONY
(overlapping the joke)
They got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.

SOSA
Maybe he'll move to Miami too...
Gabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?

Sosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.

GABRIELLA
(distracted)
Lovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.

SOSA
I'll take care of it myself.

GABRIELLA
(turning to him)
...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.

SOSA
Of course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...
(to Tony)
My fiance, Gabriella Montini.

TONY
Hello....
She nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.

GABRIELLA
It's a pleasure.

She withdraws. Tony watches her go.

TONY
I gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.

Sosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.

SOSA
(focusing the binoculars)
I like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel
the same way about the rest of your organization.

Tony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.

TONY
In-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?

SOSA
I mean Omar Suarez.

Tony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.

Sosa passes him the binoculars.

SOSA
This garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.
From several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....

Tony, astonished, looks up.

96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96
terrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by
the Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a
length of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.

SOSA
He put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.

Through the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the
chopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.
A silence.


97 TONY 97
shaken, lowers the binoculars.
Sosa watches him closely for his reaction.
Tony looks back at him, contemplative.
Sosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.

SOSA
So how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?

TONY
(awry, stalks up to him)
Hey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.
That piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..
For all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.
But that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!

SOSA
(moves away)
I think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this
Lopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.

TONY
Hey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.
(then)
You got my word on that.

Sosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,
makes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony
following the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.

SOSA
You speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.

Their eyes locked together.

Music theme continuing over.

REVERSE WIPE TO

99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99
In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
outside his office.
He jerks his head. Inside. They go.

CUT TO
100 INT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE - DAY 100
The office is highly decorated with plagues, mementos,
Cuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on
JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares
incredulously at Tony.

LOPEZ
(livid)
You what! You made a deal for fucking eighteen million dollars
without even checking with me! What are you crazy Montana, are you crazy!

TONY
Hey take it easy Frank, cone.

LOPEZ
Con0 my ass!

TONY
At 10.5 a key, it's pure Frank... we can`t lose money, no way, we make seventy-five million on this deal, Frank. Seventy-five mill! That's serious money.

LOPEZ
Yeah and what's Sosa gonna do to me when I don't come up with the first five million dollars on this deal --send me a bill? He's gonna send hit squads up here that's what. There's gonna be war in the streets.

TONY
Frank... Frank...

LOPEZ
(ranting)
You know what this fucking trial is costing me in legal fees, Montana?
...You expect me to believe Omar was a stoolie.
Cause Sosa said so? And' you bought that line?
(pause, eyeing Tony)
Maybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?

TONY
You saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?

Lopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.

LOPEZ
(carefully)
Let's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall
your deal with Sosa.

Long pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.

TONY
(finally)
...have it your way boss.

He turns to leave, nods to Manny.

LOPEZ
Montana... just remember I am the boss.

TONY
Sure you're the boss.

Gets to the door, Manny joining him.

LOPEZ
Y'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.

Tony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.

101 EXT. AUTO LOPEZ OFFICE 101
Just outside the door, Tony glances at Manny's question-mark
expression.

Fuck him!

102 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 102
Tony, impeccable in Cardin whites, and Manny, also slicked
up, are shown by an elegant secretary into a plush office.
Behind the desk sits the heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed lawyer,

George Sheffield smoking yet another cigarette, his voice a
hoarse gravelled croak, the eyes -- with their deadpan stare
-- always pausing before they speak. He doesn't get up from
his desk. His hair is flaming red. We saw him before, at the
Mutiny Club.

SHEFFIELD
What can I do for you Montana?

TONY
(indicates Manny)
My partner. Manny Ray.

Manny, standing in the background, nods... Sheffield shifts his eyes
briefly, back to Tony who plops himself in a chair.

TONY
So George, they tell me you're the best lawyer in town.

SHEFFIELD
Did they also tell you how expensive I am?

TONY
Hey it's like J.P. Morgan says -- if you gotta ask, you're outta your league.

SHEFFIELD
I see you been reading your American history Montana, what've you done lately to earn a place in it?

TONY
(chuckles)
I'm trying to stay outta it, y'know
what I mean? I'm expanding my operation. So I want a class guy like you on the payroll -- advising me. Starting now.

SHEFFIELD
(a longer pause than usual)
Cash. On the table.
...Start with a $100,000.

TONY
(an equal pause)
Sure...

He sticks out his hand. Manny slaps an envelope in it. Tony
begins counting out the cash, right on the tabletop.

Tony gets out of the car, crosses to the entrance.

104 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - DAY 104
Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face. She`s
in jeans, barefoot and casual.

ELVIRA
Tony?

TONY
Hi there.

Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
explanation. There is none.

ELVIRA.
ml.. -you just missed Frank.

TONY
I didn't come here to see Frank.
She looks at him amazed. The balls on this guy!

ELVIRA
(cooling to him fast)
This is not the time or the place.
Next time make an appointment first.

She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
bulls in.

TONY
I got something important to tell ya.
Why don't you make some drinks and act normal.

ELVIRA
Sure. Why not? We're all normal here.

She heads for the pool, nonplussed. Tony closes the door, eases slowly across the room towards her, awkwardly trying to make conversation.

TONY
I heard you was in Europe travelling 'round all by yourself. Woman like you shouldn't have to travel alone...
(pause, no response)
I been travelling myself.

ELVIRA
Broadening your intellect. I heard.

TONY
What else d'you hear?

ELVIRA
I heard you and Frank aren't working together anymore.

TONY
Yeah. It makes things easier this way, don't it?

She's puzzled. He drinks a toast.

TONY
Here's to the land of opportunity.

ELVIRA
For you maybe.

She drinks to it.

TONY
Hey, do you like kids?

ELVIRA
Kids? Sure, why not -- as long as there's a nurse.

TONY
Good. Cause I like kids too. I like boys and girls.

She's waiting. He paws the ground, awkward as a bull.

ELVIRA
That's broad of you, Tony. Travelling really helped. Look, Frank's going to be back any moment and when he walks through that....

TONY
Yeah. Yeah -- fuck Frank. Look, here's the story. I'm from the gutter but I climbed out of it. I'm not the smartest guy in the world but I got guts and I know the streets and I'm making the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go to the top, I could be somebody here in Miami. I could  be like Frank but bigger -- The biggest!

Elvira's looking at him like he's on the moon.

TONY
Anyway what I came up here to tell you is that.. .uh I like you. I think you're terrific. I known this the first time I seen you. You belong to me. We're tigers. The two of us... I want you to marry me and be the mother of my children.

Silence.

ELVIRA
(stunned)
Me? Marry you?

She laughs, a short harsh laugh.

TONY
(sincere)
Yeah... -marry me.

ELVIRA
What about Frank? What are you going to do about Frank?

TONY
Frank's not gonna last...
(puts down the drink, puts his hand on hers)
I'm not looking for an answer right now Elvira, but I want you to think about it, okay? I want you to think hard... I'll see you the next time.

He goes. She stares at him, still dazed, yet deep down -- flattered.

CUT TO

105 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 105

The place is raging tonight as Tony and Manny arrive, in
tuxedos, making their way through the crowd greeting the
many people who know them now. We might note Tony has
refined the art of walking and no longer bulls people out
of his path, he angles through them.

OWNER
(indicating a table)
Over here.

Tony stops, spots his sister Gina, in an expensive looking
dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.

TONY
What the fuck is she doing here, she's....
(heading towards her)

MANNY
(stops him)
Hey c'mon Tony, it's okay, it's justa disco for chrissake. What do you give her money for if you don't want her to go out, have some fun?

Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves back. Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.

TONY
Who's she with?

MANNY
Some kid, he works for Luco, he's harmless....

Tony spots a Large Man coming towards him. Caucasian,
about 250 pounds.

TONY
Keep your eye on her. Make sure he
don't dance too close.

MANNY
Sure Tony.
(drifting away)
I'll be at the table.

LARGE MAN
(intersecting)
Hello Tony, you remember me?


TONY
(to the Large Man)
Yeah, sure. You're...
(snaps fingers trying to remember)
...Bernstein, right. Mel Bernstein.
Narcotics, right?

BERNSTEIN
That's right, Tony.
I think we better talk.
(indicates a quieter area)

There's something ugly in his smile, maybe it's cause just the eyes do the smiling.

TONY
Talk about what, what's there to talk about? I ain't killed anybody
lately.

BERNSTEIN
No not lately but we can go back to ancient history.
Like Emilio Rebenga, like a bunch of whacked Indians at
the Sun-Ray Motel in Miami Beach....

TONY
Oh yeah? ...you know Mel, whoever's giving you your information must be taking you guys for a long ride.

BERNSTEIN
Are we gonna talk or am I gonna bust your wiseass spic balls, Tony baby -- here and now?

Tony looks at him.

BERNSTEIN
Yeah, so the news on the street is you're bringing in a lot of yeyo
Tony... that you're no longer a small-time hood, you're public property now, and the Supreme Court says your privacy can be invaded....

TONY
No shit -- how much?

BERNSTEIN
(doodling on a piece of paper)
There's an answer to that too....

He holds the paper up briefly in front of Tony. It says ""25,000""

TONY
(reacts)
That's a big number.

BERNSTEIN
That's on a monthly basis. Every month the same thing. You know how this works, don't you? We tell you who's moving against you, we shake down who you want shaken down, if you have a real problem in a collection, we'll step in for you. I got eight killers with badges working for me. When we hit, it hurts -- Same thing works the other way. You feed me a bust now and then, some new cowboy wants to go into business you let us know -- we like snacks, it looks good on the record.

TONY
S'pose I give you the money, how do I know you're the last bull I gotta grease? What about Metro, Lauderdale, DEA -- how do I know what rock they're gonna come out from under?

BERNSTEIN
That's none of our business, Tony, we don't cross no lines.
(getting up)
I don't want this discussion going any farther than this table. MY WYS have families, they're legitimate cops, I don't want none of `em getting' embarrassed `cause if my guys are gonna suffer, then they're gonna make you suffer. Comprendre?
...Oh yeah, and I got a vacation comin' up. I wanna take the wife to
London, England. We never been there. Throw in two round-trip tickets. First class.

Tony just stares at him. Bernstein smiles, points.

BERNSTEIN
I like the scar. Nice. Like Capone.
But you oughta smile more, Tony. Enjoy yourself.
Everyday aboveground's a good day.

He winks and goes. Tony sits there brooding on it, eyes flicking back to the dance floor.

Burgundy suit there is snuggling up to Gina on the dance floor. Too close.
Tony is getting pissed, he looks around for Manny, then spots....

107 INT. BABYLON CLUB ENTWWCE - NIGHT 107
Elvira walking into the club, followed by Lopez and Ernie,
the bodyguard. Lopez is delayed at the door by his buddy,
the Owner, and Elvira drifts in.
His attention diverted from Gina, Tony goes towards her.
She sees him coming, glances in Frank's direction.
Tony comes right up to her.

TONY
Hi...

ELVIRA
Hello, Tony.

Lopez, in conversation with the Owner, glances over, sees
Tony with Elvira, his expression narrows.

TONY
so.. .Did you think about.what I said? About the kids?

ELVIRA
Tony, you're really nuts you know, -- you really are.

Lopez comes over, takes Elvira's arm, and smiles at Tony.

LOPEZ
Hey Tony, why don't you get your own girl?

TONY
That's what I'm doing, Frank.

Tense look on Frank's face. The bodyguard circles.

LOPEZ
(without a smile)
Then go do it somewhere else. Get
lost.

ELVIRA
Frank, he was only...

TONY
(ignoring her)
Maybe I don't hear so good sometimes,
man.

LOPEZ
You won't be hearing anything, you
go on like this.

TONY
You gonna stop me?

Frank is livid.

LOPEZ
You're fucking right I am. I'm giving you orders.
Blow. (Esfumate)

The bodyguard moves closer to Tony who doesn't move.

Manny suddenly slides into frame, backing Tony.

TONY
(icy)
Orders? There's only one thing that gives and gets orders, cabron -- balls.

Pause. Something's about to pop, turns back just at the
crest. Lopez abruptly turns away.

LOPEZ
(to Elvira)
Let's go!

ELVIRA
Frank, this is ridiculous....

LOPEZ
C'mon!

He crowds her. she goes. Angry, Tony watches as they exit the club.

MANNY
What happened?

TONY
That cocksucker! -- He put that homicide prick Bernstein on me.

They stroll back to the table.

MANNY
What for?

TONY
The Emilio Rebenga hit. Remember that.

MANNY
You're kidding!

TONY
Who else knew about it? Omar's fertilizer, ain't he? Lopez is letting me know he's got weight on me.

MANNY
I don't know, things don't look so good here, Tony. Maybe we should get outta town for a while, y'know, go up to New York?

TONY
You go. I like the weather here just fine.

He stops, his eyes darting to pick out Gina laughing as she
follows burgundy suit out of the main room and down the
stairs to the toilets.
Without hesitation, his irritation peaking now, Tony darts
after her.

MANNY
Hey, where you going?

He doesn't answer.

CUT TO
108 INT. BABYLON CLUB - STAIRS AND LADIES ROOM - NIGHT 10E

into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
him. No Gina.

109 INT. BABYLON CLUB - MEN'S ROOM AND STAIRS - NIGHT 109
He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.
Tony moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
the door. It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
burgundy suit running his hand along her ass.

GINA
(shocked)
Tony!

TONY
What are you doing! What are you doing!

He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
times into the wall.

GINA
(trying to restrain him)
Tony! What're you doing! You're crazy!

He rips the coke out of her hands and scatters it across the tiles.

TONY
(to Gina)
What are you doing with this shit, hunh?
(back to burgundy suit)
Get the fuck out of here, maricon, y'hear, I'll kill you next time.

GINA
Fernando!

TONY
(to Gina)
Shaddup!

Manny runs in, several others now looking in from the hall.

MANNY
Tony!

Tony shoves burgundy suit out of the stall, past Manny.

TONY
Go on!

GINA
What the hell is....

TONY
You think it's cute somebody puttin' their hands all over your ass, my kid sister, hunh? In a toilet!

GINA
It's none of your business!

TONY
The fuck it isn't! Three dollar hooker, that's what you are.
Snorting shit like that at your age, you oughta ---

GINA
What are you -- a priest? A cop! Look at your life. You can't tell
me what to do!

TONY
I'm telling ya! I don't wanna see you in here again. I catch you in here I'm gonna beat the shit outta you.

GINA
Oh yeah! Go ahead!

TONY
You're getting outta here right now!
Don't push me baby, don't push me!

GINA
Don't fucking push me!

MANNY
Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get some air...

The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
the hallway. Several more people are watching.

GINA
You got a nerve, Tony, you got a nerve! You can't tell me what to do. I'll do what I want to do. I'll go out with who I want and if I want to fuck them then I'll fuck them!

Tony, raging, smacks her the face. She reels back across into the toilet.
Tony stands there, abated.

The crowd is silent.

Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina who is sobbing.

MANNY
(tender)
Come on, baby, it's okay... it's okay, he didn't mean it.
(strokes her face)

TONY
(disturbed, to Manny)
Get her home, get her outta here!

He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
no regrets, but disturbed.

Manny helps Gina to her feet.

MANNY
Come on, pussycat, I'll buy you a
cup of coffee.

He turns, catches a last glimpse of Gina leaving with Manny.

111 EXT. MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 111
Manny drives Gina home in his two-seater Mercedes sports
coupe. She's still angry.

GINA
...He's got a nerve the way he acts!
Mama's right. She says he hurts everything he touches.
Well he's not gonna hurt me anymore. He`ll never see me
again. Never!

MANNY
He loves you, what do you want. He
feels he raised you.

GINA
He still thinks I'm fifteen. He's been in jail five years and he still thinks I'm fifteen!

MANNY
Hey, you're the best thing he's got. The only thing. He don't want you to grow up to be like him. So he's got this father thing for you, protect you...

GINA
Against what?

MANNY
'Gainst assholes -- like the sleazeball in the red suit.

He says it like it's personal.

GINA
(picks up on it)
I like Fernando, he's a nice guy, he knows how to treat a woman.

MANNY
(a face)
What future's he got? On a bandstand somewhere? He's a bum, Why don't you go out with somebody who's
going somewhere?

She gives him a look.

GINA
Like who?

MANNY
Like a doctor or a dentist or something.

GINA
What about you? Why don't you take me out?

She's looking straight at him now, challenging.

MANNY
What? Me?

GINA
Yeah, you. I see the way you look at me -- Manolo Ribera.

MANNY
(nervous)
Hey, Tony's like my brother.. You're his kid sister, okay?

GINA
So what?

MANNY
So....

GINA
(taunting)
You afraid of Tony? You afraid of Tony's kid sister?

MANNY
Fuck no....

112 EXT. TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 112
Pulls the car over to the curb.

MANNY
I guess we're here.

Pause.

GINA
You think about it, okay, you think about it real hard, Manny. Cause you don't know what you're missing....

She leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.

She gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.

CUT BACK TO
113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113
The Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's ""Strangers In The Night'.

OWNER
All right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?
Now I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.

He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.

Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
When the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.

Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...

...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....

Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....

The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors...
Screams, crowd diving for cover...

Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of
his ankle, firing...
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...

Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.

Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.

The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.

CUT TO
114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114
Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.

Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.

The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.

Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.

Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.

Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.

Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

CUT TO

115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115
Tony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
reveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
it, doesn't express a reaction.

DOCTOR
It's going to be sore for a few months.

TONY
Somebody else gonna be a lot sorer...
(to Chi-Chi)
Find out where Lopez is....

CUT TO
116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116
Miriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with ""Cocaine"" written on it.

TONY'S VOICE
Miriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?

MIRIAM
Yeah... It's Tony.

Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror, takes the phone, in good spirits.

MANNY
Tony cabrone, whatcha doing -- checking up on me, too?

117 SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT INT. 117

TONY
Look, get your fuckin' clothes on and meet me outside Lopez's office in forty-five minutes. That phonebooth on 9th. Yeah.
Move your ass!

118 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 118

MANNY
What happened!

119 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 119
TONY (v.o.)
Nothing we can't fix.

Tony hangs up.

120 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 120

MANNY
(grabs his pants)
I gotta go.

MIRIAM
This is worse than fucking a grasshopper, man.

MANNY
Hey, I'm better looking.
(hits the coke again)
Don't do it all, I'll be back later.

CUT TO
121 INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:
Tony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.

TONY
(to Nick)
Nick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly. You got that?

NICK
Yeah, don't worry Tony. I got it.

TONY
All you say is you're one of the guys at the-club -- 'Hello, Mr. Lopez, there was a fuckup, he got away...'

NICK
Yeah, Tony, I got it, no problem...

CUT TO
122 INT. LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122
Waldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny
and Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...
Lopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.

LOPEZ'S VOICE
...you're kidding! Three to two?
Son of a bitch!...
(cradling the phone)
Guess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!

MUFFLED VOICE
Congratulations. That's great Frank.

Tony, Manny and Chi-chi slide into the room, the latter two
with guns casually drawn.

123 INT. LOPEZ MOTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT 123

TONY
Yeah, it sure is Frank. What'd you do -- fix the umpire?

Lopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right
there and then, but manages to recover.

LOPEZ
Tony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.

Hangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.
Lopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi
sliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the
other side of the room.

LOPEZ
Tony... what happened to you, hunh?

TONY
Yeah, lookit. They spoiled one of
my $800 suits.

LOPEZ
Jesus! Who?

in his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.

TONY
Hitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.
Never seen 'em before...Hiya
ii:;. Is there an answer to this too?

BERNSTEIN
(uneasy)
Always is Montana, always is...

LOPEZ
Jesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.

TONY
Hey, you might be right.

LOPEZ
Anyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.

TONY
(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)
Nah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.

Pause.

LOPEZ
(awkward)
Well... What are the guns for Tony?

TONY
(shrugs)
What for? I'm paranoid I guess.

The phone rings.
Lopez lets the phone ring.

TONY
Why don't you answer it Frank?

LOPEZ
Must be Elvira. You know women.
After we left that joint she....

The phone rings again.

TONY
(reaches for it)
I'll tell her you're not here.

LOPEZ
(grabs the phone first)
Wait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...
(anxious)
Yeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.

He hangs up. Pause.

TONY
Frank, you're a piece of shit.

LOPEZ
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony?

Tony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him
forward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.

TONY
You know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!

LOPEZ
Tony, no! Lissen!

TONY
You remember what a 'haza' is Frank?
It's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.

LOPEZ
(nervous)
Why would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !

TONY
Yeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the
side but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!

He squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.

LOPEZ
Mel! Mel! Do something, please!

Mel sits there impassively.

MEL
It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.

LOPEZ
Please Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll
give you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay! I'll go away Tony, I disappear, you'll never
see me again. Just gimme a chance, gimme a second chance Tony, please... please!

He sobs pathetically.

LOPEZ
I don't wanna die Tony, I never did nothing to nobody Tony! I never hurt nobody!

TONY
Yeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.

He turns to Manny.

TONY
Manny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?

Tony steps aside.

LOPEZ
No! No! Tony!

Manny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.
Lopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in
his bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.

TONY
...Every dog has his day.

He fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.

BERNSTEIN
(remaining calmly in his chair)
I told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.

TONY
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.

His eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.

BERNSTEIN
Now wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.

TONY
I'm not Mel. You are.

He produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his
left hand pointed at the big man.

BERNSTEIN
(rising from his chair)
Hey, c'mon, what is this?
You can't shoot a cop, Tony.

TONY
Whoever said you were one?

He fires.

Bernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.

BERNSTEIN
I... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...

TONY
Sure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.

He fires several times into him until we can imagine he is
no longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.

MANNY
(indicates bodyguard)
What about him?

Tony notices.
The bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.

TONY
You want a job Ernie?

ERNIE
Sure, Tony.

TONY
Come see me tomorrow.

ERNIE
Thanks, Tony.

Tony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the
hulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny
and Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.

MANNY
(Offscreen)
Okay, torch it!

CUT TO
124 INT. LOPEZ CONDO - THAT NIGHT 124

Elvira lies in her silk sheets. The doorbell rings. She
gets up.

In a nightgown, she opens the front door.

ELVIRA
Tony?

Tony, still in his ruined suit with the arm in a sling, moves past her into the apartment.

ELVIRA
What's happened?

Tony just stands there.

ELVIRA
Where's Frank?

TONY
Where do you think? ...Why don't you go pack your stuff. We're going home.

Pause. She understands, moves quietly past him towards the
bedroom.

Tony ambles over to the windows and steps out on the terrace,
breathing in the air. The lights of Miami wink at his feet...

. . . the camera moving to one sign down there that says it
all, flashing its big neon bracelet ---

In an exclusive area of Coral Gables, surrounded by walls,

which he has,-- with a sense of humor -- added a large neon
sign on the front lawn that says:
THE WORLD IS YOURS

MONTANA TRAVEL CO.

Just like it should be.

. . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely short dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina, her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her, evenly and openly as....
Tony and Elvira kiss.

151 EXT. TONY'S GROUNDS - SAME DAY 15

Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira, nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.

Across a moat of water, a striped nine-foot Bengal tiger stretches majestically under a solitary banyan tree, extending a giant claw and licking himself.

Tony and Chi-Chi kidding around with the tiger.

CUT TO
151-B INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - MONTH DATER 151-B

Tony, accompanied by Manny, walks a young, thirtyish bank
president into his office, which is rigged with video monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.

There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs -- but not one sign of a book on the walls.

Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who never stops thinking money.

TONY
...yeah, well, I can't pay that no more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm talking ten million a month now. That's serious money. So I think it's time you bank boys come down a bit, y'know, like....

BANKER
Hey, Tony, c'mon, that's crazy, I can't do...

TONY
That's too bad, cause....

BANKER
Tony, sweetheart, we're not a wholesale operation here, we're a legitimate bank.
The more cash you give us the harder it is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we can't even take anymore of your money unless we raise the rates on you.

TONY
You gonna what, Jerry?

BANKER
Tony, Tony, we gotta. The IRS is coming down heavy on South Florida, y'know. That Time Magazine cover didn't help any. We gotta do it Tony, we got stockholders, we gotta go ten percent on the first twelve million; that's in denominations of twenty. We'll go eight percent on your ten dollar bills and six points on your fives.

TONY
Ten points!

we go someplace else.
Hey, Tony,

BANKER
Tony, Tony -- it's no conspiracy, we're all doing it. You're not gonna find a better deal.

TONY
Then fuck you, I'll fly the cash to the Bahamas myself.

BANKER
You gonna fly it yourself, Tony -- on a regular basis? Once maybe. And then what? You gonna trust some monkey in a Bahamian bank with twenty million of your hard-earned dollars? C'mon Tony, don't be a schmuck -- who else can you trust? That's why you pay us what you do -- you trust us.

Tony looks broodingly. Jerry glances at his watch, suggesting
he has another engagement,

BANKER
Stay with us, you're an old and well-liked customer. You're in good hands with us... gentlemen, I gotta run. How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.
See you. Take care.

Going.

Tony watches, raging inside. He pulls a drawer open and reaches for a private cocaine supply. It's the first indication we have of this. As he snorts:

TONY
That prick, that WASP whore. Jhat's
come over he think I am, some maricon on a boat....

So why don't we talk to this Jew Seidelbaum? He's got his own exchange, he charges four percent tops -- and he's connected.

TONY
I don't know. Mob guys -- guineas -- I don't trust 'em.

On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker, leaving. Now beginning to see things through the glass darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually -- passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.

TONY
(eyes wandering across to another video monitor)
You get the house sweeped this month? The cars?

MANNY
Yeah, sure, I told you that. Five thousand it set us back.

TONY
See that cable truck there?

152 INT. TONY'S MANSION OFFICE - DAY - VIDEO MONITORS 152
Tony's eyes fixing on the cable TV truck parked across the
street.
A man is hauling cable.
There are other private gates visible. The area is lush with gardens, Spanish moss, cypresses and quietly respectable million dollar houses with their Spanish tile roofs and balconies.

MANNY
Yeah?

TONY
Hey Manny when does it take three
days to rig a cable, hunh?

MANNY
Cops.

TONY
What if it's the Diaz brothers? What if they're gonna come and get me?

MANNY
I'll check it out.

TONY
You check it out, then we're gonna blow that fuckin' truck back to Bogota.

MANNY
The truck could be anything. We're not the only dopers living on the block y'know.

TONY
Hey you got some attitude y'know Manny -- for a guy in charge of my security.

Hey I'll check it out. I'm just telling you we're spending too much
on this counter-surveillance shit. Twelve percent y'know, of our adjusted gross -- that's not pocket money.

TONY
You worry about it, it lets me sleep
good at night. There's that fat guy
again.

Manny looks over at a jogger running by the gate -- of the
porcine quality, civilian-looking, fifties.

TONY
I seen him every day. 'Bout a week now.

MANNY
So the guy jogs around the neighborhood. He's some fat accountant.

TONY
How the fuck do you know what he is?

MANNY
Hey if he's a cop, don't you think running in circles around a house is a pretty dumb way to watch it?

TONY
Maybe not...
(walks away, stops, looks back)
I'm telling you we're getting sloppy -- our thinking -- our attitude.
We're not fucking hungry anymore!

TELEVISION COMMERCIAL
A television spot for Florida Security Trust (or Miami Security Trust or Dade Security Trust depending on legal options). A respectable business-type walks along the sidewalk with a renascent downtown Miami as a backdrop. Skyscrapers, glinting glass, cranes....

BANK SPOKESMAN
Here at Florida Security Trust we've
been putting your money to work for a
better America. We've been around for seventy-five years. We'll be here tomorrow.

A logo for the firm over with the reminder ""Since 1907.""

Camera pulling back to reveal Tony watching in his huge gold-
leaf bathtub, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looks
like a character in a Futzie Nutzie loafing cartoon, with his
TV hooked to one side of the tub, a long phone line to the
other, and a radio and portable bar all within reach.

TONY
(to the TV)
Yeah that's cause for seventy-five years you been fucking all of us over, that's why.
(to Manny)
Somebody oughta do something about these whores. Charging me ten points on my money and they're getting away with it! There's no laws anymore,anything goes.
Listen, these guys been here for a thousand years. They got all the angles figured.

Manny straddles a chair next to the tub watching the m
news that was interrupted by the Florida Security Trust
commerical. Behind him Elvira's in d robe, fixing herself
up in front of a giant mirror. It's some bathroom --
gigantic with a chandelier hanging in the middle of it,
Italian marble, plants, skylights, rugs, etc....

TONY
You know what capitalism is --
Getting fucked.

ELVIRA
A true capitalist if ever I met one.

She's doing a toot of coke off a flat mirror.

TONY
How would you know, bubblehead? You ever do nothing 'sides get your hair fixed and powder your nose? You do too much of that shit anyway.

ELVIRA
Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that Tony.

TONY
Know what? Why do you always got to talk like that?

MANNY
(changing the subject)
So I had a pow-wow with this guy
Seidelbaum today. He checks out.
I  got another meet set up.

TONY
When?

MANNY
Thursday ten o'clock. I thought I'd take Chi-Chi with me. Do a million and some change. Get my- feet wet with this guy.

TONY
That's a lot of wet. I'm not Rockefeller. Not yet.

Tony points to a figure on the TV.

TONY
Hey, listen to this, guy's always good for a laugh.

Visual of silver-haired television Anchorman -- Vic Phillips -- with a bit of show business image in him -- to be seen again. Underneath his face, it says ""Editorial.""

NEWS ANCHORMAN
...the question is how with a small law enforcement budget do you put a dent in an estimated $100 billion a year business? It seems at times all you can do is put your finger in the dike and pray but now we are hearing voices that say the only way we can solve the drug problem is the same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but by legalizing and taxing them. These voices say that will drive out the organized crime element...
(pause for effect)
I am not one of those voices.

TONY
(responding)
What do you know -- you never been right in your life, Vic baby...

Guy never fuckin' tells the truth.

ELVIRA
You're boring. Money, money, money!
That's all I hear in this house. Frank never talked about money.

TONY
Cause Frank was dumb.

ELVIRA
You know what you've become Tony -- an arriviste, an immigrant spic millionaire who can't stop talking about how much money he's got or how he's getting fucked. Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.

TONY
What're you talking about, I worked my ass off for all this.
(indicates the bathroom)

ELVIRA
(starts out)
It's too bad. Somebody should've given it to you. You would've been a nicer person.

TONY
Hey you know what your problem is pussycat....

ELVIRA
(at the lip of the bathroom)
What is my problem, Tony?

TONY '.
...you got nothing to do with your life that's what.

MANNY
Tony, c'mon....

TONY
Why don't you get a job y'know? Be a nurse, work with blind kids, lepers, open a stationary store, I don't give a shit. Anything beats lying around waiting for me to fuck you all the time.

ELVIRA
(stung)
Don't toot your horn honey, you're not that good.

TONY
Frank was better?

ELVIRA
(guietly)
You're an asshole.

She goes.

TONY
(calling after her, guilty)
Hey c'mon Elvie, whatta we fight for, this is dumb!

He splashes the water in his tub and slams the TV shut.

MANNY
(watching)
I guess married life's not all that it's cracked up to be, hunh, Chico?

A friendly smile but Tony just stares glumly after Elvira.

MANNY
(rises)
I gotta hot date....

TONY
(glaring into his bathwater)
This Seidelbaum thing?

Yeah?
TONY
Me and Nick'11 take care of it. You
stay out of it.

MANNY
(very surprised)
Why! It's my deal.

TONY
You stink as a negotiator, that's why. You like the ladies more'n you do the money -- that's your problem Manny.

MANNY
Hey wait a second, I'm your partner
Tony, you can't trust me, who the
fuck can you trust?.

Pause. Tony mumbles something, barely heard.

TONY
Junior partner.

MANNY
(catching)
Junior partner my ass!

TONY
I'm in charge. Do as I say. You go to Atlanta, you handle the Gomez
delivery there.

MANNY
(a beat)
You oughta lissen to your wife, muchacho. You are an asshole.

He leaves, pissed, Tony mumbling to himself in his bath.

TONY
(to himself)
Fuck you too... what do you know, who the hell put things together... me!
Who do I trust -- me, that's who....

DISSOLVE TO

159 EXT. WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
""CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160
The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
moving, talking.
Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.

The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
look the part.

It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.
At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.

LUIS
. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures
I was in that picture down in Columbia.
Burn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.
We're good friends. I was his driver...

NICK
(stacking)
Oh yeah?

LUIS
Yeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.
(pause)
Yeah, I also know Paul Newman. I worked with him in Tucson.

NICK THE PIG
That so? Say, you know Benny
Alvarez there?

LUIS
Uh...

SEIDELBAUM
(interrupting to Tony)
Now you want a company check here for $283,107.65?

TONY
(pause, checking his fingers)
Uh... I come up with 284.6

SEIDELBAUM
(pauses, looks again at his figures)
No, that's just not possible. The
machine don't make mistakes.

TONY
Well, we'll count it again.

SIEDELBAUM
Oh Jesus!

TONY
Hey business is business. We're talking $1500.

SEIDELBAUM
(exasperated)
Okay, you keep the change okay, I don't give a shit.

TONY
Okay but I'll go through it again with you.

Seidelbaum ignores it, counting up another stack.

SEIDELBAUM
Okay... This check now, this one goes to the...

TONY
Montana Realty Company.

NICK
(to Luis)
How come you don't know Benny Alvarez?

DISSOLVE TO

161 INT. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY
They're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke
filling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest
of green and they're still counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their eyes.

SEIDELBAUM
We're up to what?

LUIS
(consulting his notes)
Seven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.

TONY
(grins)
Hey we're almost finished. Another 200 thousand and we can take a leak.

SIEDELBAUM
Yeah, but this'll do fine.

Pulls a pistol from his ankle and rises.

SEIDELBAUM
You're under federal arrest, Montana,
for a continuing criminal conspiracy.
The RICO Statute. Get 'em up.

Tony astonished.

TONY
Oh shit... You're not kidding hunh?

Eyes darting. Considering the options. The little fat man's eyes are suddenly agile and mean-.-Tony reads them, lifts his arms.

SEIDELBAUM
(to Luis)
Get it.

Luis moves around Tony to disarm him.

TONY
So how do I know you guys are cops?

Luis, produces a wallet with identification, shoves it under Tony's nose.

LUIS
What's that say, asshole?
Insert: Photograph and Drug Enforcement Agency ID.

TONY
(impressed)
Hey that's good work, where can I get one of those?

LUIS
Cabron! You call yourself Cuban?
You make a real Cuban throw up.

SEIDELBAUM
Looie! Cool it.

TONY
(unfazed; wiping the sweat off)
Call your dog off, Seidelbaum. I wanna call my lawyer.

SEIDELBAUM
Lotta good he's gonna do you Montana. There's an eye there in the wall.
(points)
Say hi, honey....

162 IN'P. SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY - REVERSE ANGLE ON VIDEOTAPE
Blurry image of the men in the room. Tony is not that
clear an image as he glances briefly, uninterested, into the camera.

TONY
Yeah, is that what you jerk off in front of Seidelbaum?

NICK
Oh shit and I was supposed to meet this chick at three. What a pain in the ass.

SEIDELBAUM
(to camera)
Okay, Danny, turn it off.
The angle goes black.

163 BACK TO SCENE 163

SEIDELBAUM
(reciting the Miranda)
All right, Montana, you have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can be taken against you. You have the....

TONY
(cuts him off)
I know all that shit, Seidelbaum, save your breath. It ain't gonna
stick. You know it, I know it. I'm here changing dollar bills is all.
So you wanna waste everybody's time here, I call my lawyer. Best lawyer in Miami. He's so good tomorrow morning you're gonna be working in Alaska, Seidelbaum....

CUT TO
165 XNT. TONY'S BATHROOM - DAY 165

Tony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts his
hair. A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,
goes out. It's the first time we sense he might be using
the stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.

CUT TO

166 INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Tony is pacing nervously. Manny looks on. Red-headed
Sheffield rasps through a cloud of cigarette smoke behind
his desk.

SHEFFIELD
. ..you give me a check for a hundred grand plus three hundred in cash and I guarantee you walk on the conspiracy charge. But they're gonna come back at us on a tax evasion -- and they'll get it.

TONY
What am I looking at?

SHEFFIELD
Five years, you'll be out in three, maybe less if I can make a deal.

TONY
For what! Three years in the can!
For washing money? This whole country's built out of washed money!

MANNY
Hey, Tony, what's three years? lt's not like Cuba here. It's like going to a hotel.

Tony shakes his head, grimacing like he's having an
epileptic fit.

SHEFFIELD
I'll delay the trial. A year and a half, two years, you won't start doing time till '85.

TONY
No...no, they never get me back in a cage.. -never! HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

SHEFFIELD
Tony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.

Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
Sheffield's desk.

TONY
All right -- all right. I do the three fuckin' years but lemme tell
you about my law, George. It's realsimple. There's no 'reasonable doubt.' If you're rain-making the judge or you fuck me for the four hundred grand and I come in guilty on the big rap -- you, the judge, the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop me, y'hear?
I'm gonna come and tear your fuckin' eyeballs out.

Pause.

SHEFFIELD
(cool)
The point is made. Now where's the money?

Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
desk. Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
hands as he steps out of the office. He sniffs.

167 EXT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 167
Camera follows Tony with Ernie and Chi-Chi dowr'the outside
gallery onto the veranda where Sosa is reclining with
several other men -- all in casual clothes, enjoying their
coffee after lunch.

SOSA
(rising)
Tony...Tony.

TONY
Alex.

They hug like they were the closest of friends.

SOSA
I'm glad you made it on such short notice. I appreciate it. How`s Elvira?

TONY
She's okay. How's your wife?

SOSA
Three more months.

TONY
That's great.

SOSA
And you, when are you going to have another Tony to take your place.

TONY
(sore point)
I'm working on it.

SOSA
I guess you'll have to work harder, Tony.

They laugh, nervously. Sosa is a little more reserved with
him than before -- in tune.with the other men at the meeting.

SOSA
Tony, come, I want you to meet some friends of mine.

He smoothly guides Tony towards the group of men who rise.

SOSA
This is Pedro Quinn, chairman of Andes Sugar here...Tony Montana.

PEDRO QUINN
A pleasure, Mr. Montana.

Camera tracking through ad-lib introductions, the music
assuming a faint martial stride.

SOSA
General Eduardo Strasser, Commander of the First Army Corps...Tony Montana.

The man is in civilian clothes.

SOSA
Ariel Bleyer, from the Ministry of the Interior... Tony Montana.

The cameras moving past Sosa's black aide, the Skull (who
nailed Omar) silent behind his sunglasses, to an American-
type in a Brooks Brothers suit who stands.

SOSA
Charles Goodson -- a friend of ours from Washington.

TONY
Hi....

GOODSON
How do you do, Mr. Montana...

He smells like a government guy. Sosa summons the black aide -- in a hushed voice.

SOSA
Nicky, have Albert meet us in the living room.

The black aide goes.

SOSA
(solicitous)
Tony, come, please sit here.

Tony is shown a chair in the middle of the veranda,
surrounded on all sides. There is a strained beat to the
proceedings. Ernie and Chi-Chi hang around the edges.

He suddenly catches a glimpse of the sloe-eyed Gabriella
moving with another woman past a window of the house. Then
she's gone.

Sosa pulls up a chair right opposite Tony, almost touching
knees.

SOSA
Tony, I want to discuss something that concerns all of us here....

TONY
Sure, Alex.

SOSA
Tony, you have a problem; we have a problem... I think we can solve both our problems.

Tony waits.

SOSA
We all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....

Pause. Tony looks. The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
gaze away.

TONY
And your problem, Alex?

Sosa looks around, stands up.

SOSA
Come, I'll show you.

Tony cautiously stands to follow him.

CUT TO
168 INSERT - INT. SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168
MATOS STUDY
A ""Phil Donahue-type"" setting. A segment now in progress
with the ""Donahue-type"" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.
Gutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and
polished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of
enormous passion.

GUTIERREZ
More than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It
sells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!

INTERVIEWER
I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.

GUTIERREZ
The irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,
Jim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.

INTERVIEWER
So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

GUTIERREZ
(laughs)
Let me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --

Gutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV
screen, dour, ruthless.

GUTIERREZ
. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.
Now if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?

Laughter.

169 TONY 169
watching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from
the coke usage.

SOSA
A Communist -- financed by Moscow.

170 GUTIERREZ 170
holds up another photograph -- insert the face on the
TV screen.

GUTIERREZ
...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....

INTERVIEWER
What are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?

GUTIERREZ
(passionate)
The United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.

171 TONY 171
staring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.

GUTIERREZ
You Americans have no idea how important your country is as a
symbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....

Sosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.

SOSA
...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...
That's our problem.

TONY
Yeah.

Sosa looks up.

The Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into
the room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over
Tony. The Skull leads him in.

SOSA
You've met Alberto before?...

TONY
(remains seated)
Sure. How could I forget?

SOSA
Alberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.

Alberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.

SOSA
(to Tony)
So you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...
(*en)
Is that a problem, Tony?

Tony looks around the faces, then:

TONY
That's no problem, Alex....

Alex nods, pleased.
Hold on Tony. He blows his nose again.

CUT TO

175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT
A millionaire's place, like ""The Forge"" on Arthur Godfrey
Road. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.

TONY
Hey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.

Vic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--
cranes his leonine white head of hair around with a
patrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.

VIC
Oh, is that so?

TONY
Yeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?

VIC
Aren't you... Tony Montana?

TONY
(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)
Yeah, that's me.

The half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.

TONY
(waves to them)
Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.

Waves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.

MANNY
(reproving)
Hey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....

TONY
I don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!

Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
of an anguish he does not understand.

CUT TO

173 TONY
sits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....

MANNY
So what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?

TONY
Lot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.
The whole world's turning into politics.

He pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.

MANNY
The one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.

TONY
Yeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?

Manny remembers.

TONY
No free rides in this world, kid.

MANNY
So who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?

ELVIRA
What guy?

TONY
(to Manny)
You stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.

He takes a hit, unnoticed.

ELVIRA
(unheard)
What guy?

MANNY
(to Tony)
I don't like it.

TONY
You don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!

What's Seidelbaum got to do with this?
Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the
table with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to
Elvira's untouched plate.

TONY
Why don't you eat your food, what's
wrong with it?

ELVIRA
I'm not hungry.

She quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-
ment of her hand.

TONY
So what'd you order it for?

ELVIRA
I lost my appetite.

She does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.
Two beats. He passes a silent burp.

MANNY
(trying to shift the mood)
So what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....

Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.

TONY
(ignoring the question)
Is this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?
Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?
You're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
Is that what it's all about?

MANNY
It's not so bad Tony, could be worse....

TONY
(doesn't hear)
. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?
(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)
A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!

MANNY
(gently)
Tony, you're drunk.

TONY
...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it
man, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!

Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps
her plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.

ELVIRA
You sonufabitch! You fuck!

They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
around to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food
off himself.

ELVIRA
How dare you talk to me like that!
You call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!

The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVIRA
. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons
around all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?
(in a softer tone)
Oh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...

Silence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's
this awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot
their lines.

TONY
(softly)
Go on, get a cab home, you're stoned.
(to Manny)
Manny.

ELVIRA
No, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't
even know it.

TONY
All right I'm stoned.

MANNY
(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)
Come on, baby.

ELVIRA
No, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...
(staring at Tony)
I'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.

Pause. She starts wobbling out.
Past the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.

TONY
Let her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.

Stumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.
Tony's eyes follow her. Pause.

The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
food, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food
and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

TONY
You're all assholes. You know why?
Cause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.

He wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony
shakes him loose.

TONY
You need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.

He starts out, staggers.

TONY
So say good night to the bad guy...
You're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.

He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
and delight.

CUT TO
174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT
A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
moves into frame.

Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
under the car.

Tony looks:

175 ERNIE
down the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying
traffic, signals okay.

176 CHI-CHI
waits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.

Tony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
snort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
under.

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
axle of the car.

177 ERNIE
signals.

178 TONY
sees it.

A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
towards us.

Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
Tony hurries to the car, bends down.

TONY
(Spanish)
Psst! La Jara! Apaga.

The Shadow douses it and freezes in position.

Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to her partner who eases the car to a halt.

Tony hurries out into the street, taking the initiative.

TONY
Hey officer, uh you haven't seen a little dog have you, a little white poodle, it's around here somewhere?
Jesus, my kid's gonna go crazy when he hears I lost 'im. Oh boy am I gonna be in trouble.

FEMALE COP
Why don't you check the ASPCA okay? They handle that stuff....

TONY
The ASPCA? What's that? ...Jesus, that's not the place where they chop these dogs up is it?

FEMALE COP
(in a hurry)
Look it up in the Yellow Pages okay, buddy.
(signal to her partner, they drive off)

Tony looks at them go, takes another snort, walks over to
the car, bangs on the hood several times.

TONY
Hey smiley, come on outta there, you're under arrest!

178 CONTINUED 178
Pause. The Shadow, unsmiling, appears from under the car.
gun drawn, glowing with perspiration. When he realizes it's
a joke, his eyes blaze at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck you doing!

TONY
(winks)
Hey that was close, hunh?

. . . Yeah, _ yeah...nah, nah...you tell Sheffield keep his nose out of it, there's not gonna be no trial, I got everything under control, yeah... Have you heard from Elvira?

He waits, hangs up, snorts some more, impatient. He picks up the phone again, starts dialing.

181 INT. TONY'S NEW YORK SEDAN - DAY 18:
In the sedan, the Shadow peers over, angry, at Tony.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
What the fuck's he doing now! That sonufabitch....

182 INT. PHONE BOOTH - NEW YORK r DAY 18;
In the booth, Tony, snorting another nostril, moves back
and forth as the phone rings at the other end. Finally she
picks up.

ELVIRA'S VOICE
Yes?

TONY
Hello baby, how's Baltimore?..hey look Elvie, I been thinkin' 'bout us, you know and....

The phone goes dead. Furious he slams it back down, stalks back out to the sidewalk.

183 OMITTED 183

184 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 184
He gets in the driver'6 seat. The Shadow's next to him
with the radio transmitter, Chi-Chi, in the back. Tony, seemingly unaffected by the weather, reaches for an open pint of ice cream, starts eating it with a plastic spoon.
He alternates ice cream with coke through the scene;the
dashboard of the car cluttered with cartons of half-eaten
Chinese food.

The Shadow, disgusted with all this mess, restrains himself,
staring out at the street with a hate-filled expression,
saying nothing.

CHI-CHI
(concerned)
Everything okay Tony?

TONY
Yeah roses. Where is this fuckin' guy?
I don't got all day to piss away.

CHI-CHI
Probably fucking his wife.
(eating pizza)
Jeezus it's cold.

185 THEIR POINT OF VIEW THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
The door of the brownstone. No movement. Though now
there's increasing traffic on the street and passing pedestrians.

TONY
. . . we oughta shoot him when he comes
out the door, save a lotta bullshit.

186 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

CHI -CHI
What's so important about this guy anyway? What's he, a Communist?

TONY
(snorting through his mouth)
Nah he's no Communist. He's a kinda symbol, that's what he is.

CHI-CHI
What the fuck's that mean -- symbol?

TONY
It's like when you die, your life meant something to somebody, y'know? It wasn't like you just lived it for yourself, but you did something for the rest of the human race too...

Tony snorts another line -- seen through the rearview mirror.

CHI-CHI
(nods his head somberly)
Yeah?

TONY
Me, I wanna die fast. With my name written in lights all over the sky. Tony Montana. He died doin' it.

CHI-CHI
Whatcha talking 'bout Tony, you ain't gonna die.

TONY
(doesn't hear him)
...So I'll end up in a coffin. So what? The cockroach fires the bullet's gonna end up in a coffin just like me. But I lived better when I was here. And that's what counts.

Pause.

TONY
(nervous, to Ernie)
Ernie, what time?

ERNIE
Ten to.

TONY
(opening his door)
I gotta call Manny.

He starts out the door. The Shadow barks out something in
preemptory Spanish.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Sit down!

TONY
Hey, you don't tell me what to do, you,...

CHI-CHI
Tony, he's coming!

187 EXT. MATOS' STREET - DAY
Tony looks around, sees:
Matos coming out the door, briefcase in hand.

Tony gets back in the car.

188 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos gets into his sedan a quarter block down from his front door.

189 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony staring.
The Shadow, most excited of all, like a panther that just
spotted his prey, eyes alive for the first time.

190 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos sits there warming up his car, looking back at the brownstone.

191 XNT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY

SHADOW
(Spanish, excited)
...The UN -- right in front of it.
In the daylight. That's the way they want it.

Tony breaks open a fresh vial.

TONY
(English)
Hey okay I don't give a shit where, okay, you can blow him up when you like okay, just tell me okay -- when you like.

The chatter comes out jagged, irritating the Shadow who
doesn't understand Tony's English anyway.

SHADOW
(Spanish; to Chi-Chi)
What's he saying! You tell him stay inside thirty metres of the car okay -- no more you just stay inside thirty metres.

TONY
(English)
Hey, okay, I heard you the the first time. One time okay. Just tell me one time.
(snorts)

SHADOW
(Spanish)
I tell you thirty metres okay! You understand, madre de dios, why this hop-head is driving!

CHI-CHI
Okay, okay.

TONY
(English)
Okay, okay, cool it willya, all right.

192 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY
Matos pulls his car out of the parking space.

Tony puts his car in gear, prepares to pull out when:

Matos stops his car, backs up -- in the direction of his front door.

TONY
What the ---

Matos comes to a halt, double-parked, honks.

193 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
What's he doing? Where's he going?

194 MATOS' BROWNSTONE - SIDEWALK - DAY
The wife opens the door, steps out -- followed, moments
later, by two schoolchildren, books in hand. Matos waves
to them to come along.

195 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony looks astonished, back at Chi-Chi.

TONY
What the fuck! You said the wife took `em in the other car.

CHI-CHI
She did boss. She did it every fuckin' day, I swear!

196 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 196
The two children are now climbing in the back of Matos'
sedan, the wife getting into the pasenger seat. They drive off.

197 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 19:
Tony, upset now, goes to his vial, snorts, turns sharply to
the Shadow.

TONY
Hey Chico, no fuckin' way! No wife, no kids! We hit this fuckin' guy we hit him alone okay.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
No! Mr. Sosa says we do it now.
We do it.

He has the strength of a born psychopath, brooking no other reality but his own. He stares a hole through Tony who gives way to his intensity, going into a slow angry burn at himself, putting the sedan in gear and going after Matos,
muttering to himself.

TONY
...aw fuck this, this fuckin' asshole!

Chi-Chi, in the back, looks on worried.

198 NEW YORK STREETS - DAY - FOLLOWING MATOS' SEDAN
through Manahattan, towards the UN.

The Shadow making the final adjustments on his decoder. He now sticks a key in it. A red light pulses at intervals.

Tony, driving, glances, the tension building in him, he
does another giant snort.

Matos' sedan, swerving out into traffic to pass a car, has
a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.

The Shadow goes nuts, peering over the dashboard to see if
the bomb came loose.

SHADOW
(to himself, Spanish)
Madre de dios, my bomb! -- don't you fuckin' fall, my little baby!
Perspiration starting to break out on his forehead.

Tony also feels the sweat coming on.

TONY
(muttering)
...this is fuckin' crazy, man, this is sloppy doing it this way, you
don't do it like this....

He honks furiously at a cab that tries to cut him off.

199 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY
Tony, intense at the wheel, sneezing, his nose running.

SHADOW
(equally tense, in Spanish)
You're losing them! There! That street, they go that street!

TONY
I see 'im! I see `im!

SHADOW
(Spanish)
Thirty metres! Thirty metres! Go! Go!

TONY
Shut the fuck up!
Honking like a madman and accelerating past a truck....

TONY
...what am I doing? What the fuck am I doing here?...

200 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 200
sedan pulling off at 47th and Second Avenue heading
Mato's
for the United Nations building which now appears at the
end of the street.

201 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 20:
SHADOW
(Spanish)
Okay, now...now. Right here.
Easy. Easy!
The decoder.

Tony snorts.

TONY
(muttering)
Aw, fuck you, you fuckin' vulture....

The Shadow in stark profile.
His finger depresses the first key of the decoder.

UNDER MATOS' CAR - DAY
202 20;

The bomb -- pulsing red light.

203 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 203
The Gutierrez sedan pulls off the sidestreet into the thick
of First Avenue traffic -- approaching the striking facade
of the United Nations.

204 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 204
The Shadow is in a full sweat.

SHADOW
(Spanish)
...okay, okay, nice 'n' easy...at the corner... when he pulls up at the corner.

His finger hovering around the second key of the decoder.

Chi-Chi in the back, leaning forward across the seat.

TONY
(muttering)
Two kids in the car, Jesus Christ!

205 UNDER GUTIERREZ' CAR - DAY 205
The bomb -- jarred by -a bump, pulsing red light.

206 THROUGH TONY'S WINDSHIELD - DAY 206
Gutierrez' sedan inches its way out of the traffic and eases along the curb.

207 INT. TONY'S SEDAN - DAY 207
Tony honking his way through traffic after them, building
to a climax with himself.

TONY
(muttering)
...bunch of fuckin' vultures. You don't have the guts to look 'im in the eye when you kill him, you gotta hide, you fuckin' vulture.

Honk, honk.

SHADOW
Shut up!

CHI-CHI
(suddenly panicked)
He's gonna get out! Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

TONY
(ignoring all the commotion)
makes you feel good, hunh?
Killing the wife and the kids. Big man. Well fuck you! What do you
think I am? You think I'd kill two kids and a woman. Well fuck that!
I don't need that shit in my life.

His face twisted in agony, he reaches down and snaps his Beretta free from his ankle holster. He swings it around sharply, leveling it on the Shadow.

TONY
Motherfucker!

The Shadow glances over at Tony, astonished. Tony pumps
two shots point-blank into him, blowing his face off and
smashing him against the door of the moving sedan, blood
and brains splattering the windows and the seat covers.

CHI-CHI
Oh Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
What the....

Tony swerving the sedan back across the Avenue, the traffic
around them honking and moving along at its normal pace as
the Shadow's body slumps down out of sight, another Monday
morning traffic accident with blood and brains splattered
up against a passenger window and nobody really sees...
except a six-year-old girl in an adjacent vehicle; she
wonders momentarily, then dismisses it.

TONY
(continuing to mutter)
...so what'd you think I was, hunh?
A fucking worm like you! I told you don't fuck with me! I told you no kids! You shoulda listened to me you stupid fuck!

Chi-Chi waiting in a busy lounge covering Tony on the phone;
Tony's still wearing the same clothes with patches of blood
on them.

TONY
Ernie? Where the fuck you been?

ERNIE'S VOICE
I had a delivery. Tony, everything go okay, whatsa ---

TONY
Fuck no? Where the hell's Manny? I been calling all over.

ERNIE'S VOICE.
I don't know, Tony. He's been gone last couple of days. Didn't say nothing.

TONY
What! Where! I left that sunufabitch in charge! What the hell is going on here, can't I trust anybody anymore.

ERNIE'S VOICE
I don't know, Tony, he just took off, y'know, he didn't say nothing...
you all right?

TONY
No, I'm not all right. I'm pissed off! And when I 'get there I'm gonna kick some ass all over the fuckin' place!

ERNIE'S VOICE
When you coming back, Tony?

TONY
Tonight!
(repeating to himself)
Where the hell is that cocksucker?
I can't trust nobody no more. You think just cause I'm a nice guy....

ERNIE'S VOICE
Uh, Tony, your mama called. Gina's gone. She got to see you right away.

TONY
Gina's gone? Where! Oh fuck! ...Tell her I'll be there tonight. Okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Right.

TONY
(about to hang up, pauses)
uh -- how 'bout Elvie -- did she call?

ERNIE'S VOICE
(a beat)
No.

TONY
Yeah, okay, okay... listen if she calls, tell her I love her, okay?

ERNIE'S VOICE
Yeah, okay Tony.

Tony hangs up. A moment of despair. Then he snorts
another spoon and snaps back.

Tony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained clothes, rushes in.

213 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 213
Ernie meets them at the door.

TONY
Hear from Manny?

ERNIE
No Tony. Your mama called again.
She gotta see you. And Sosa's been ringing every half-hour on the eleven line. Tony, he sounds pissed, he....

TONY
Yeah, yeah, yeah... Chi-Chi, get him on the line. In the office.

Chi-Chi goes.

TONY
What about Elvie -- anything?

Ernie shakes his head.

TONY
You keep trying Manny. I need that cocksucker, you hear, I need him here! Okay?

ERNIE
Right, Tony.

Tony stalks off, towards his office.

214 INT. TONY'S OFFICE

Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
and stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

TONY
Yeah? Hi. Mami.

Her voice on the phone sounds hysterical and angry.
The other phone is ringing.
Not really listening, Tony breaks open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.

Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.

TONY
(into the phone)
Yeah, all right. I hear you. I'll be there!
No problem, okay.

He hangs up, snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi indicates.
The telephone should be the latest in gimmickry.

TONY
. . . so whaddaya say Alex?

Pause. The voice at the other end is very controlled, very
cold.

SOSA'S VOICE
So what happened Tony?

TONY
(casual)
Oh we had some problems.

SOSA'S VOICE
Yeah, I heard.

TONY
How'd you hear?

SOSA'S VOICE
Cause our friend gave a speech today at the UN. He wasn't supposed to give that speech.

TONY
(shrugs)
Yeah, well, your guy Alberto was apiece of shit, he didn't do what I
said so I cancelled his fuckin' contract.

Pause at the other end.

SOSA'S VOICE
e . . M-y partners and I are pissed off.

TONY
Hey Alex, no big deal. There's plenty other 'Albertos'. So I'll
deliver the goods next month.

SOSA'S VOICE
(suddenly angry and letting Tony know)
No! We can't do that. They found what was under the car, Tony. And our friend's got security now up the ass. And the heat's coming down hard on me and my partners.
There's not gonna be a next time. You blew it, you fuckin' dumb cocksucker!

TONY
Hey, you don't talk to me like that!
Who do you ---

SQSA' S VOICE

I told you a long time ago, you little fuckin' monkey, not to fuck me and....

Tony holding the mouthpiece away from his ear and talking at it like it was a face.

TONY
Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to, hunh! Whatta you think
I am? Your fuckin' slave! You don't tell me what to do, Sosa. You ' re
shit! You want a war, you got it?

Slams the phone down.

The bulletproof white Corniche pulls up, Ernie and Chi-Chi
getting out first, checking the street, Tony following quickly.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
You try Manny again. Gimme five minutes.

He hurries towards the house.

217 INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 21:
Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
previously, as if overwhelmed by events.

MAMA
. she got a place of her own, she don't tell me where. One day I follow her in a taxi. She goes into this fancy house in Coconut Grove.

TONY
The Grove? Where'd she get that kinda money?

You ! You were giving her the money, what do you think -- don't you see what you do to her, don't you....

TONY
I never gave her that kinda money.

MAMA
Yes, you did! One time. One thousand dollars you gave her!...

TONY
Mama, was there a guy with hex?

MAMA
I don't know, there was this other car in the driveway. I know if I went in there, she'd kill me, she's like you, she....

Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
by the shoulders.

TONY
Where's this house, tell me!

MAMA
Citrus Drive. Four hundred something.
Four hundred nine. You gotta talk to her Tony, she don't listen to me anymore. She says to me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
Exactly like you do to me. Ever since you come back, she's been getting this way.

He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.

MAMA
Don't you see what you do to her?
Don't you see? Why do you have to hurt everything you touch, why do you....

TONY
(shakes himself loose, turns on her)
No! You know why she left, Mama?
Not cause of me. Cause of you.

MAMA
Me?

TONY
Yeah, it's you drove her nuts withyour nagging and bitchin'.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Nagging and bitchin'? I only demand a little respect and dignity in this house, is that why I am nagging and bitchin'?

TONY
(continuing)
...and you did the same thing to me. I wasn't this, I wasn't that --
never good enough for you. I never felt nothing from you, Mama -- nothing!

MAMA
(interrupts)
. . . because I was putting food on the table, because I suffered for both of you....

TONY
First time I ever needed you, where were you?. . .

MAMA
Where was I?

TONY
...when I was in that Army jail in Cuba, rotting my ass off, not once.
I hadda come out into the fuckin' streets to find out my mother and my sister are gone from my house, they left the country, not one word, one letter, that's right.- Where were you?

MAMA
(interrupts)
You ! ..sin verguenza. From the time you were five, you gave me heartbreak and humiliation and shame....

TONY
That's right! That's right. What did you expect!

MAMA
(interrupts)
.that's what you brought into this
i&use. If I were to listen to you, you would convert my house into your gangster headquarters....

TONY
What do you expect now? To be loved?
You got no love in you, Mama.
What do you think Papi left for? And Gina? At least I didn't walk around with my head hanging down between my legs my whole fuckin' life. Like Papi -- like the way you made Papi feel. I made something outta my life. I'm somebody and I'm proud of it.

MAMA
(interrupts)
Somebody? You're proud? You're a
(Escoria!)
nothing. You're an animal!

Tony storms out of the door as Mama pursues.

MAMA
God help me, what have I done to you?
You were a beautiful baby. I used to watch you sleep. So beautiful. How? How, Dies Santo, did you become such a monster, such an ugly little monster....

Tony slams the door, we hold a beat on her face -- as if she had finally answered her own questions.

218 EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE 218
Tony stomps into his white Corniche, Ernie discreetly
closing the door and getting in with Chi-Chi as Mama rips
open her door in b.g. and stands there staring from the
doorway -- weeping and staring across the dark. Tony
takes a strong hit of coke. The car whistles off.
CUT TO

219 EXT. HOUSE - COCONUT GROVE - THAT NIGHT 219
Tony in the backseat of the Corniche with Chi-Chi studies
the house from across the curb. It's quiet, rich, suburban,
not calling attention to itself.

Tony, seething, snorts another line of coke laid out on the
crystal bar dividing the backseat, and rewed, goes.

TONY
(to Chi-Chi)
Wait here.

He approaches the front door, listening, the hand sliding into his pocket. Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays over the stereo. He rings a buzzer, waits.
Hold the pause. The door opens casually. Standing there is Manny -- with a towel around his waist.

MANNY
(surprised)
Tony?

Tony stares, stunned.
Gina now comes into view behind Manny -- in a bathrobe, a
big smile of welcome for her brother.

GINA
Tony!
(eyes suddenly moving downward in alarm)

Tony with his Beretta pointed at Manny, his expression filled with loathing.

Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony over the edge.

MANNY
Hey Tony, c'mon we was....

The gun fires.

GINA
Tony! No!

Tony fires a second time.
Manny slowly slumps downward against the doorjamb, eyes on Tony, terribly surprised.

Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
Manny lies at his feet, dead.

GINA
Manny!

She goes down to her knees, stunned out of her mind, shakes him.

GINA
Manny!

She looks up, insanely, at Tony, her eyes huge with disbelief.

GINA
You killed him?

Shaking her head at him incredulously.

GINA
We got married just yesterday. We were gonna surprise you.

Tony stands there, doubly stunned by the news.

GINA
Manolo, oh Manolo, what'd he do?
What'd he do?

She hugs his corpse tightly to her breast and makes
horrible strangled sounds with her throat.

Chi-Chi hurrying up to Tony, worried somebody's seen the shooting. Ernie follows.

CHI-CHI
Tony, come on. We gotta get out of here
(to Gina)
Come on baby...Gina!

Suddenly she goes berserk.

GINA
Noooooooooooo!

And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony, screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill him. She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious, numbed.

Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands. They manage at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to scream.

220 EXT. MANNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 220
Lights coming on in the houses around the neighborhood.

Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
the pavement into the Corniche. She continues to scream.

ERNIE
(to Chi-Chi)
Get the body!

Tony, back at the door, looks down again.
The eyes of Manolo staring sightlessly.

Chi-Chi runs back, grabs Tony.

CHI-CHI
Tony!

Pulls him. Tony snaps out of it.

TONY
Yeah!

He goes. Chi-Chi lifting Manny's body, hauling it.
Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against the front seat. Chi-Chi propping Manny into the driver's seat with him. The car roars away.

The camera closing on Gina as she looks through the glass partition of the Corniche, at the slumped head of Manny in foreground, the music surging inexorably.

GINA
Manny! ...Manny! No!

CUT TO -
221 MIAMI STREETS - NIGHT 221
The white Corniche whistles by like a hearse heading for hell.

222 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - THAT NIGHT 222
It goes roaring by the front gate and up the driveway,
gravel flying.

The camera curving to reveal two sedans inching up the
shadowed street, towards us, their lights out. The cars stop.
Eight men emerge silently, blending into the shadows of the trees.

223 INT. TONY'S MANSION - NIGHT 223

Tony, scratches across his face, strides through the front
door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting
for them at the door.

Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb with shock.

CHI-CHI
What do we do with her Tony?

TONY
Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
Put her in my bedroom.
(to Gina)
It'll be all right, pussycat, you'll see everything'11 be okay, I'll take
care of you....

She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his face. Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares, upset but passive.
They trundle her up the stairs. Tony turns and walks away.

224 INT. TONY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 224
Tony slumps on his couch. A haze of coke rises off the velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the black marble coffee table.

Ernie and Chi-Chi come in.

CHI-CHI
We got some pills into her, she's cooling down.

Tony pays no attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile of coke.
Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the length of coffee table.
Pause as he lets it sink in.

CHI-CHI
(worried)
Boss, what we gonna do now?

TONY
Do? We're gonna war that's what we gonna do.
We gonna eat Sosa for breakfast. We're gonna close that
fucker down.

Ernie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.

CHI-CHI
(eyeing the coke)
Hey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?

Tony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.
Ernie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.

Tony starts on another trek along the coffee table.

CUT TO
225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225
The Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.
A monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.
The monkeys listen quietly.
The flamingoes flutter.
. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...

. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.
. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
balustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically
catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

TONY
(insensate)
. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....

His point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.
Tony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!

TONY
...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...
Well what the hell happened, hunh?
What the hell happened to us?...

In far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:

The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring
out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.

Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.

A third monitor carries another image of shadows moving
through the trees on the estate.

On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
incoherent.

TONY
...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would
you sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...

As Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:

226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226
As he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.
Tony sees her.
She steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.

GINA
Is this what you want Tony?...

Tony shocked.

GINA
You can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.

She fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.

The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.

GINA
I'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.

Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.

GINA
Come and get me Tony. Before it's too late.

He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.

GINA
Come on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---

ERNIE
Get outta here!
Tony, they're everywhere!

Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.

TONY
(gently)
Hey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.

Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.

TONY tx:
Come on Gina, get off the floor.
You're all dirty now, you need a bath...
Mami's gonna be angry baby
-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..
Come on open your eyes my baby,
open your eyes.. -give me a smile.

There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.
One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
pounding it.

CHI-CHI
Boss ! Hey boss. Open up!

On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
goes off, blows him up against the door.

TONY
Cheeee!

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.

On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.

Tony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,
talking to himself.

TONY
So you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.

Karroooomph!
The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.
It sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.

Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

TONY
Whores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?

Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

TONY
Who you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!

Another hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.
A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
away. Laughing like a madman.

TONY
You need an army you hear! An army to kill me!

Behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go
up in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

TONY
Ha ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!

The Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.

Tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior
swimming pool below.

He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.

As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.

The camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:
""THE WORLD IS YOURS""
And so, for the brief moment, it was.

Our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,
panning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the
wealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing
that obscene word ""Chivato"" in blood on the outside walls,
past the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut
Grove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay
