#### Songs Attributes

With the data scraped from the Spotify API based on the list of songs from Wasabi Songs dataset, approximately 2 millions songs, filtered by the popularity of the artist from billboard top 100 since 1948. We look at the songs attributes including danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, and valence. The distribution of these property shows quite a good distribution of the data and the songs that we have for our model. Although speechiness and liveness tends to be on the lower side, it does not really impact our songs distribution of mood range that much as the liveness parameter is the detection of the presence of audience in the audio and speechiness represent the spoken words that is not melodic in the audio. These 2 do not seems to impact the range of mood that much versus danceability, energy, acousticness, and valence which distributes quite well in the middle. Hence, it can be safe to assume that we can get a normally distributed songs' attribute if we sample from the dataset for our model representation.

Moreover, the distribution of scatter plots in the pairplots amongs the attributes in the chart below shows that there are no significant correlations between attributes. This means that songs attribute will not present multicollinearity issues in our lyrics clustering analysis.
