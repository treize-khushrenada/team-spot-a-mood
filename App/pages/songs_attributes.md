#### Songs Attributes

With the data scraped from the Spotify API based on the list of songs from Wasabi Songs dataset, approximately 2 million songs, were filtered by the popularity of the artist from billboard's top 100 since 1948. We look at the attributes of the song including danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, and valence. The distribution of these properties shows quite a good distribution of the data and the songs that we have for our model. Although speechiness and liveness tend to be on the lower side, it does not really impact our songs distribution of mood range that much as the liveness parameter is the detection of the presence of the audience in the audio, and speechiness represents the spoken words that are not melodic in the audio. These 2 do not seem to impact the range of mood that much versus danceability, energy, acousticness, and valence which distributes quite well in the middle. Hence, it can be safe to assume that we can get a normally distributed songs' attribute if we sample from the dataset for our model representation.

Moreover, the distribution of scatter plots in the pairplots among the attributes in the chart below shows that there are no significant correlations between attributes. This means that songs attribute will not present multicollinearity issues in our lyrics clustering analysis.
